item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to your reading of our management discussion include the following o a description of our business strategy and management philosophy  found in items and business and properties business strategy  o a description of recent developments during  found in items and business and properties recent developments  and o a description of our risk factors  found in items and business and properties risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  the fair values used to determine possible asset impairment charges  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  exposures under contractual indemnifications and various other recorded or disclosed amounts 
however  we believe that certain accounting policies covering the matters discussed below are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
often  as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses  additional information is obtained  requiring revisions to estimated costs 
these revisions are reflected in our income in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
in december  after a thorough review of potential environmental issues that could impact our assets or operations  we recognized a million reduction in environmental expense and in our overall accrued environmental liability  and we included this amount within other  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the million income item resulted from adjusting and realigning our environmental expenses and accrued liabilities between our reportable business segments  specifically between our products pipelines and our terminals business segments 
the million reduction in environmental expense resulted from a million loss in our products pipelines business segment and a million gain in our terminals business segment 
legal matters with respect to legal proceedings  we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
sfpp  lp is the subsidiary limited partnership that owns our pacific operations  excluding calnev pipe line llc and related terminals acquired from gatx corporation 
tariffs charged by sfpp are subject to certain proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services  on our pacific operations pipeline systems 
generally  the interstate rates on our pacific operations pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our pacific operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints 
we currently believe that these ferc complaints seek approximately million in tariff reparations and prospective annual tariff reductions  the aggregate average annual impact of which would be approximately million 
however  even if substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  we believe that the resolution of these ferc complaints will be for amounts substantially less than the amounts sought

intangible assets with respect to goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting pronouncements introduced the concept of indefinite life intangible assets and required us to prospectively cease amortizing all of our intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill 
such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
the new rules also impact future period net income by an amount equal to the discontinued goodwill amortization offset by goodwill impairment charges  if any  and adjusted for any differences between the old and new rules for defining intangible assets on future business combinations 
additionally  a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
we completed this initial transition impairment test in june and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  we have selected an impairment measurement test date of january of each year and we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of january  as of january   our goodwill was million

the fiscal year ended december  marked the sixth successive year since the change in control of our general partner in february that we have improved on all four of these operating measures 
in  our net income was million per diluted unit on revenues of  million  compared to net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in  and net income of million per diluted unit on revenues of  million in in  we benefited from a cumulative effect adjustment of million related to a change in accounting for asset retirement obligations pursuant to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  our income before the cumulative effect adjustment totaled million per diluted unit 
for more information on this cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting principle  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
equity earnings from our investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting  net of expense from amortization of excess investment costs  were million in  million in and million in because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis  we look at each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses including amortization of excess cost of equity investments as an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  consists primarily of all cash receipts  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves 
our general partner and our common and class b unitholders receive quarterly distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives quarterly distributions in additional i units 
the value of the quarterly per share distribution of i units is based on the value of the quarterly per share cash distribution made to our common and class b unitholders 
in both and  all four of our reportable business segments reported year to year increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the increases in our earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over were primarily due to higher earnings from our co and natural gas pipelines business segments 
our co segment benefited from both increased activity in oil field operations and the acquisition of additional working interests in oil producing properties 
these acquisitions included the following o effective june   we acquired mkm partners  lp s ownership interest in the sacroc oil field unit for million and the assumption of million of liabilities 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the sacroc unit to approximately  and o effective november   we acquired certain assets in the permian basin of west texas from a subsidiary of marathon oil corporation for million and the assumption of million of liabilities 
the assets acquired included marathon s approximate interest in the yates oil field unit  the crude oil gathering system surrounding the yates field and marathon s ownership interest in the pecos carbon dioxide pipeline company 
this transaction increased our ownership interest in the yates unit to nearly and allowed us to become operator of the field 
our natural gas pipelines segment benefited from increases in natural gas transportation  storage and sales activities 
this increase was primarily due to the further integration of our kinder morgan tejas and kinder morgan texas pipeline systems  and to our newly completed north texas and mier monterrey  mexico pipeline systems 
we acquired kinder morgan tejas  formerly tejas gas  llc  effective january  our north texas and mier monterrey pipeline systems began operations in august and march  respectively 
we also benefited from the inclusion of a full year of expanded operations on our trailblazer pipeline 
in may  we completed an expansion project that increased trailblazer s transportation capacity by approximately 
the acquisition  construction and subsequent integration of all of our natural gas related operations  especially within and around the state of texas  has resulted in an integrated and valuable portfolio of natural gas businesses 
the increase in total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in over was primarily due to higher earnings from our natural gas pipelines and terminals business segments 
the increase was attributable to both solid internal growth and to contributions from acquired assets 
our significant acquisitions included the purchase of kinder morgan tejas  as well as the acquisition of various bulk and liquid terminal businesses acquired since the end of for more information on our acquisitions  please see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
additionally  we declared a record cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of an annualized rate of 
our distribution for the fourth quarter of was higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of  and higher than the per unit distribution we made for the fourth quarter of we expect to declare cash distributions of at least per unit for  however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve this level of distribution

our products pipelines segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the table above  the segment s earnings include a million loss from the adjustment and realignment of our environmental liabilities referred to above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
excluding this environmental loss  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to this increase resulted from higher earnings from our pacific operations  north system  calnev pipe line llc  transmix operations  central florida pipeline  our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company and our west coast product terminals 
earnings in were positively impacted by higher revenues  mainly from fees for ethanol blending services at our pacific operations and west coast terminals and revenues from product deliveries related to overall strong demand for diesel fuel 
the overall increase was offset by lower earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from both our ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system and our cypress pipeline mainly due to lower operating revenues 
in addition  due to the continuing process of converting from methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe to ethanol in the state of california  we realized a small reduction in california gasoline volumes 
mtbe blended gasoline is being replaced by an ethanol blend and ethanol is not shipped in our pipelines  however  fees that we earn from ethanol related services at our terminals positively contribute to our earnings 
as of december   we had ethanol blending facilities in place at all of our california terminals necessary to serve all of our customers 
we do not anticipate that the switch to ethanol from mtbe will have a material adverse effect on our products pipeline segment 
excluding the environmental loss  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in compared to all of our products pipelines businesses reported year over year increases  with the exception of plantation  where earnings were essentially flat across both years 
the overall increase was driven by higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our calnev pipeline and terminal operations  where we benefited from including a full year of operations in versus nine months in we acquired calnev pipe line llc on march  in addition to calnev  we realized higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to from all of the following businesses our proportionate interest in cochin  our pacific operations  central florida pipeline  transmix operations  west coast terminals  north system and our cypress pipeline 
the million increase in segment revenues in compared to was driven by a million increase in combined revenues from our pacific operations and west coast terminals  largely due to increased terminal services 
revenues from our north system increased million in versus although throughput deliveries on our north system dropped by in  we benefited from a increase in average tariff rates as a result of an increased cost of service tariff agreement filed with the federal energy regulatory commission in may revenues from our calnev pipeline increased million in versus  due to higher revenues from both refined product deliveries and fees associated with ethanol blending operations 
calnev benefited from a increase in the average tariff per barrel moved  due mostly to an increase in transportation of longer haul  higher margin barrels 
revenues from our transmix operations increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher processing volumes at our transmix facilities located in richmond  virginia and indianola  pennsylvania 
revenues from our central florida pipeline operations also increased by million in versus  due to higher storage revenues at our liquids terminal located in tampa  florida and to higher refined product delivery revenues associated with a increase in delivery volumes 
the overall increase in segment revenues in compared to the prior year was offset by a million decrease in revenues from our investment in the cochin pipeline system and a million decrease in revenues earned from our cypress pipeline 
in  cochin s earnings and revenues were negatively impacted by lower delivery volumes associated with decreased propane production in western canada and by a pipeline rupture and fire in july 
the drop in propane production was a reaction to lower profit margins from the extraction and sale of natural gas liquids caused by the rise in natural gas prices since the end of  and the pipeline rupture and fire led to the shut down of the system for days during the third quarter 
the year to year drop in cypress revenues was due to lower throughput volumes and to customers catching up on liquids volumes earned but not delivered in prior periods 
combining all of the segment s operations  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products  consisting of gasoline  diesel fuel and jet fuel  decreased in compared to this decrease reflects the impact of the transition from mtbe blended gasoline to ethanol blended gasoline  and the fact that ethanol cannot be transported via pipeline but must instead be blended at terminals 
our combined diesel and jet fuel deliveries  however  increased in versus  mainly due to a increase in diesel delivery volumes and to improvement in jet fuel delivery volumes in the fourth quarter of the million decrease in revenues and the million decrease in operating expenses in compared to include reductions of million in transmix revenues and million in transmix expenses  both resulting from our long term transmix processing agreement with duke energy merchants 
during the first quarter of  we entered into a year agreement with duke energy merchants to process transmix on a fee basis only 
under the agreement  duke energy merchants is responsible for procurement of the transmix and sale of the products after processing 
this agreement allows us to eliminate commodity price exposure in our transmix operations 
excluding the decrease in transmix revenues  segment revenues increased million in compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to a million increase in revenues earned from our calnev pipeline  the result of an almost increase in average pipeline tariff rates and the inclusion  in  of a full year of operations versus nine months in our proportionate share of revenues from the cochin pipeline system increased million in compared to as a result of higher volumes and tariffs as well as increases related to our additional ownership interest acquired on december  our pacific operations reported a million increase in revenues in compared to although mainline delivery volumes remained flat in  compared to the prior year  overall revenues were higher due to a increase in average pipeline tariff rates and higher non transportation revenues 
for all products pipelines owned or operated at both december  and  total throughput delivery of refined petroleum products was up in over our gasoline delivery volumes increased in  compared to a increase nationally 
although our total jet fuel delivery volumes were down in  reflecting the effects of the september  terrorist attacks  deliveries of jet fuel improved steadily throughout the year 
the segment s operating expenses remained flat in  compared to  and  excluding the million decrease in our transmix cost of sales expense referred to above  the segment s operating expenses increased only million in  compared to this increase was primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses on the cochin pipeline system  due to the increase in delivery volumes and our additional ownership interest 
earnings from equity investments consist primarily of earnings from our approximate ownership interest in plantation pipe line company and our ownership interest in heartland pipeline company  both accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
earnings from our products pipelines equity investments were million in  million in and million in the million increase in equity earnings in versus was primarily due to a million increase in equity earnings related to our ownership interest in plantation 
the increase resulted primarily from higher litigation settlement costs recognized during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by lower earnings from product deliveries in the decrease in earnings from product deliveries were mainly due to lower revenues associated with a decrease in product delivery volumes in compared to the decrease in delivery volumes in compared to resulted from longer than anticipated refinery maintenance  weather and a new specification for atlanta  georgia gasoline  which some of the refiners that supply plantation did not make in in  plantation delivered a record level of refined products 
the million increase in equity earnings in versus was again due to an increase in our proportionate share of plantation s earnings 
in  plantation had both higher revenues  lower operating expenses and lower interest expenses than in the higher revenues resulted from record delivery volumes  the lower operating expenses resulted from lower power costs and the lower interest expenses resulted from lower average borrowing rates 
in december  we assumed the operating duties of plantation pipe line company pursuant to an agreement reached with the other owner of plantation 
excluding the environmental loss  other income items increased million in versus  mainly due to gains realized from sales of property  plant and equipment by our pacific operations 
the year to year increases in income taxes from to and from to primarily related to the overall growth in taxable income related to the operations of plantation pipe line company 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments  were million  million and million in each of the years ended december   and respectively 
the million increase in versus was driven by higher property and plant depreciation expenses from our pacific operations  calnev pipeline and west coast terminals 
this increase was related to the capital spending we have made since the end of in order to strengthen and enhance our business operations on the west coast 
the million decrease in versus was primarily due to a million decrease in expenses from the amortization of excess investment costs  related to our ownership interest in plantation pipe line company 
effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets and ceased amortizing the amount of our equity investment costs that exceeded the underlying fair value of net assets 
for more information on our adoption of sfas no 
 see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  on july   we experienced a rupture on our pacific operations tucson to phoenix line 
through a combination of increased deliveries on our los angeles to phoenix line and terminal modifications at our tucson terminal that allowed volumes of phoenix grade gasoline to be trucked into phoenix  we were able to deliver most of the volumes into the phoenix area which normally flow through the ruptured line 
the inch diameter line  which was temporarily taken out of service on august   resumed service on august  the impact of the rupture on our results of operations for was not material 
for  we currently expect that our products pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  an approximate increase over the earnings increase is expected to be driven by a continued improvement in gasoline and jet fuel delivery volumes  planned capital improvements and expansions  terminal acquisitions and expected adjustments to ferc indexed tariff rates

our natural gas pipelines segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of  million in the segment s million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization as well as its increases in both revenues and operating expenses in compared to  were primarily attributable to internal growth on our texas intrastate gas pipeline systems and to contributions from two pipeline expansion projects our north texas pipeline  completed in august  and our mier monterrey mexico pipeline  completed in march the combined operations of kinder morgan tejas and kinder morgan texas pipeline  the two major components of our texas intrastate group  accounted for million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  compared to the increase was driven by higher natural gas sale volumes and higher earnings from storage and transportation services 
our kinder morgan tejas operations include a  mile intrastate natural gas pipeline system that has access to a number of natural gas supply basins in texas 
the acquisition and subsequent integration of kinder morgan tejas assets with our kinder morgan texas pipeline  has produced a strategic and complementary intrastate pipeline business that purchases  sells and transports significant volumes of natural gas 
since our acquisition of kinder morgan tejas  we have increased the interconnection capability between its system and kinder morgan texas pipeline  improved systems processes and controls and further refined the management of risk associated with the sale and transmission of natural gas 
our objective is to match every purchase and sale  thus locking in the equivalent of a transportation fee 
we manage any remaining price risk by the use of energy financial instruments 
combined  our north texas pipeline and our mier monterrey pipeline accounted for million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  compared to included in this amount are earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million from the start up of our mier monterrey pipeline 
the pipeline stretches from south texas to monterrey  mexico and can transport up to dekatherms per day of natural gas 
we have entered into a year contract with pemex gas y petroquimica basica  which has subscribed for all of the capacity on the pipeline 
the pipeline connects to a  megawatt power plant complex and to the pemex natural gas transportation system 
by integrating the operations of our north texas and mier monterrey pipeline systems with our texas intrastate systems  by entering into new long term transportation  storage and sales contracts with customers like bp and pemex  and by extending existing contracts with other customers  the segment increased total natural gas transport volumes by and natural gas sales volumes by nearly in  compared to the segment s million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to  as well as the significant increases in both revenues and operating expenses between these two years  related primarily to our january  acquisition of kinder morgan tejas and its subsequent integration with kinder morgan texas pipeline 
the intrastate systems accounted for million of the segment s total increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  compared to both kinder morgan tejas and kinder morgan texas pipeline operate intrastate natural gas pipelines within the state of texas and both purchase and sell significant volumes of natural gas  which is transported through their pipeline systems 
the purchase and sale activity results in considerably higher revenues and operating expenses compared to our rocky mountain interstate natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan interstate gas transmission and trailblazer pipeline company 
both kmigt and trailblazer charge a transportation fee for gas transmission service but neither system has significant gas purchases and resales 
together  our rocky mountain pipelines accounted for million and million of the segment s total year to year increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization for the years and  respectively 
the increase in both years was mainly due to the benefits resulting from an expansion of our trailblazer pipeline system 
in may  we completed a million expansion project that increased transportation capacity on the pipeline by approximately 
as a result  trailblazer realized a increase in natural gas transportation volumes in compared to  and a increase in natural gas transportation volumes in compared to in  the segment also benefited from higher operational sales of natural gas at higher margins by kmigt 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to included a million decrease in earnings from our casper and douglas natural gas gathering and processing system  primarily due to higher natural gas liquids producer settlement payments  in  resulting from increases in natural gas prices in the rocky mountain region since the end of we account for this segment s investments in red cedar gas gathering company  coyote gas treating  llc and thunder creek gas services  llc under the equity method of accounting 
earnings from these equity investments were relatively flat across all three years 
in  higher earnings from our investment in thunder creek were offset by lower earnings from our investment in red cedar 
in  the million increase in equity earnings compared to resulted primarily from increases of million from each of our ownership interest in coyote and our ownership interest in thunder creek 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges  including amortization of excess cost of investments  were up million in compared to  primarily due to depreciation charges on the newly completed north texas and mier monterrey pipeline systems 
the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization charges in over were primarily the result of our kinder morgan tejas acquisition and higher depreciation expense related to the completed expansion of our trailblazer pipeline system 
for  we currently expect that our natural gas pipelines segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  an approximate increase over the earnings increase is expected to be driven by increases in storage and transportation services  additional earnings realized from the sale of natural gas at higher margins and the benefits of reaching new markets and customers by planned capital spending

the increase in oil production was driven by both expansion projects at sacroc and by acquisitions of additional ownership interests in the sacroc and yates oil field units  as referred to above 
oil production at sacroc  located in the permian basin of west texas  increased in compared to  and in compared to in  we also benefited from an almost increase in our realized weighted average price of oil per barrel from per barrel in to per barrel in 
as a result of our oil reserve ownership interests  we are exposed to commodity price risk  but the risk is mitigated by our long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
increases in oil field operations throughout the permian basin since the end of resulted in higher delivery volumes of carbon dioxide  including deliveries on our central basin pipeline  our majority owned canyon reef carriers pipeline  our owned cortez pipeline and our new centerline pipeline  which began operations in may for these four pipelines combined  carbon dioxide delivery volumes increased in and in the centerline pipeline consists of approximately miles of inch diameter pipe located in the permian basin between denver city  texas and snyder  texas  and primarily transports carbon dioxide to the sacroc oil field unit 
the pipeline transported billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide during we do not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  we capitalize the cost of co that is injected into the sacroc unit as part of our enhanced oil recovery process 
the co costs incurred and capitalized as development costs for the sacroc unit were million  million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we estimate that such costs will be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
it is expected that  due to the nature of this enhanced recovery process and the underlying reservoir  the capitalized cost for co in the through period will represent a peak and will decline thereafter 
the year to year increases in operating expenses were primarily related to higher operating  maintenance  and fuel and power costs  all as a result of the higher oil production volumes 
the million increase in earnings from equity investments in compared to reflects the net of a million increase in equity earnings from our investment in cortez pipeline company  partially offset by a million decrease in equity earnings from our previous interest in mkm partners  lp the increase in earnings from our equity interest in cortez was mainly due to higher carbon dioxide delivery volumes  lower average debt balances and slightly lower borrowing rates 
equity earnings from mkm partners  lp was lower during due to the fact that we acquired the partnership s ownership interest in the sacroc unit effective june   and the partnership was dissolved effective june  the million increase in earnings from equity investments in compared to resulted from higher earnings from the segment s investment in cortez  again mainly due to lower average debt balances and lower average borrowing rates  partially offset by slightly lower carbon dioxide delivery volumes in compared to non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges were up million in compared to  primarily due to higher production volumes  capital investments  and acquisitions of property interests since the end of the million increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization charges in over were primarily the result of the capital expenditures we have made since the end of  which resulted in a higher unit of production depletion rate 
for  we currently expect that our co segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  an approximate increase over the earnings increase is expected to be driven by the continuing development of the sacroc oil field unit  increased ownership interests in the yates oil field unit for the full year with oil production expected to be essentially even with  and increased transportation of carbon dioxide volumes across all of our carbon dioxide pipelines

the segment reported earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in this compared to earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in and earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on revenues of million in as noted in the above table  the segment s earnings include a million gain from the adjustment and realignment of our environmental liabilities referred to above in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
excluding the environmental gain  segment earnings before depreciation and amortization increased million in compared to approximately half of this year to year increase was attributable to expansion projects at existing liquids terminals  and the remainder was attributable to solid contributions from the bulk and liquid terminal businesses we have acquired since september  the internal growth was driven by the ongoing expansion projects undertaken to increase leaseable liquids capacity at our liquid terminal facility located in carteret  new jersey on the new york harbor  and at our pasadena and galena park  texas facilities  located along the houston ship channel 
these expansion projects have contributed to a increase in our overall liquids terminals leaseable capacity in compared to  more than offsetting the slight drop in our overall utilization percentage 
over half of the decline in utilization during was associated with tank maintenance 
the acquisition of new terminal businesses acquired since september  included the following o the owensboro gateway terminal  acquired effective september   o the st 
gabriel terminal  acquired effective september   o the purchase of four floating cranes at our bulk terminal facility in port sulphur  louisiana in december  o the bulk terminal businesses acquired from mj rudolph corporation  effective january   and o the two bulk terminal businesses in tampa  florida  acquired in december the above acquisitions accounted for million of the total million increase in revenues in  compared to the remaining increase includes year to year increases of million from our carteret and galena park liquids terminal facilities and million from our ownership interest in the international marine terminals partnership 
the increase from carteret and galena park was driven by expansion projects  additional liquids storage contracts and escalations in annual contract provisions 
we have completed the construction of five  barrel petroleum products storage tanks at our carteret facility since the end of the third quarter of the increase from imt  which operates a bulk commodity transfer terminal facility located in port sulphur  louisiana  was driven by an almost increase in bulk tonnage transfer volume  primarily coal and iron ore  and by higher dockage revenues 
the segment s overall increases in both earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization and revenues in compared to included decreases of million and million  respectively  from our cora coal terminal facility located near cora  illinois 
the decrease in coal revenues and earnings was primarily related to an expected decrease in coal tonnage handled under contract for the tennessee valley authority 
the tva has diverted some of its business to new competing coal terminals that have come on line since the end of the million increase in operating expenses in compared to was due to the above acquisitions and to higher operating  maintenance and rental expenses at imt  all resulting from the increase in transfer volumes 
excluding the environmental item mentioned above  segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in  compared to revenues and operating expenses increased million and million in versus  respectively 
this growth in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  revenues and operating expenses was driven by the acquisitions and asset purchases that we have made since the last half of and internal growth 
in addition to the acquisitions referred to above  these acquisitions included the following  o the terminal businesses we acquired from koninklijke vopak nv  effective july   o the terminal businesses we acquired from the boswell oil company  effective august   o the terminal businesses we acquired from an affiliate of stolt nielsen  inc in november  o kinder morgan materials services llc  formerly laser materials services llc  acquired effective january   o a interest in international marine terminals partnership a interest acquired effective january  and an additional interest acquired effective february   and o the milwaukee bagging operations  acquired effective may  combined  all of our acquisitions since the last half of accounted for incremental amounts of million in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  million in revenues and million in operating expenses in  compared to the remaining million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amoritization was attributable to internal growth at existing facilities  primarily driven by the expansion work at various terminals that were completed since the end of expansion projects undertaken during at our carteret and pasadena terminals contributed to a increase in the segment s leaseable capacity of liquids products  compared to the prior year 
in addition  while adding the incremental capacity during  we maintained a strong liquids capacity utilization rate of  the same level reached in the segment s overall increases in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization  revenues and operating expenses in compared to  included decreases of million  million and million  respectively  related to a decline in engineering services resulting from a general downturn in business since the end of income tax expenses totaled million in  million in and million in both the million decrease in compared to  and the million decrease in compared to were primarily due to favorable tax adjustments related to the taxable income and tax paying obligations of kinder morgan bulk terminals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization charges were million  million and million in each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase in versus was primarily driven by higher depreciation charges on property  plant and equipment utilized in our bulk terminal operations 
the increase was mainly due to higher bulk terminal property acquisitions and capital spending  and to adjustments made to the estimated remaining useful lives of depreciable property since the end of the million increase in compared to was primarily due to additional acquisitions and expansions that were capitalized since the end of for  we currently expect that our terminals segment will report earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense of approximately million  an approximate increase over the earnings increase is expected to be driven by the on going capital expansion projects at our liquids terminal facilities  by expected increases in certain bulk tonnage transfer volumes  most notably soda ash  petroleum coke  fertilizer and synfuel  and by the addition of our tampa  florida bulk terminal facilities  purchased in december other items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense and minority interest 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  legal fees  insurance and office supplies and rentals 
overall general and administrative expenses totaled million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher legal expenses  employee benefit and pension costs and overall corporate and worker related insurance expenses 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was principally due to additional employee benefit  compensation and reimbursement charges  higher insurance related expenses and administrative expenses related to our kinder morgan tejas acquisition 
we continue to manage aggressively our infrastructure expense and to focus on our productivity and expense controls 
our total interest expense  net of interest income  was million in  million in and million in the million increase in net interest items in compared to and the million increase in net interest items in compared to each reflect higher average borrowings since the end of the prior year  partially offset by decreases in our average borrowing rates 
minority interest  which includes the general partner interest in our five operating limited partnerships  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in both the million decrease in compared to  and the million decrease in from resulted primarily from our may acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in trailblazer pipeline company that we did not already own  thereby eliminating the minority interest related to trailblazer 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are debt service  sustaining capital expenditures  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from operations  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through borrowings under our credit facilities  issuing short term commercial paper  long term notes or additional common units or issuing additional i units to kmr 
in general  we expect to fund o cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  o expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with cash retained as a result of including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr  o interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and o debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations 
we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors

this amount has been budgeted primarily for the purchase of plant and equipment and is based on the payments we expect to make as part of our sustaining capital expenditure plan 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  versus million in the million decrease in compared to was primarily the result of an million use of cash relative to net changes in the collection on and payments of our accounts receivables and payables in compared to a million source of cash from these changes in in addition to timing differences  we made higher payments to settle related party payables at the beginning of  primarily for reimbursements to kmi for costs related to the construction of our mier monterrey natural gas pipeline and for general and administrative services 
we also paid million in for reparations and refunds under order from the federal energy regulatory commission 
the reparation and refund payments were mandated by the ferc in a consolidated proceeding in ferc docket or concerning rates charged by our pacific operations on certain interstate portions of their products pipelines 
for more information on our pacific operations regulatory proceedings  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the impact of these payments and the working capital timing differences were partially offset by a million increase in overall cash earnings  reflecting the strong performance and growth that occurred across our business portfolio during it also includes a million increase in cash flows related to higher payments made in under certain settlement agreements and a million increase related to higher distributions from equity investments in the litigation settlements were primarily related to tariff related agreements between shippers and our products pipelines  and the increase in distributions from equity investments in compared to mainly related to higher returns from our equity interest in the red cedar gathering company 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the prior year 
the million decrease in funds utilized in investing activities was mainly attributable to higher expenditures made for strategic acquisitions in outlays for acquisition of assets  new businesses and investments totaled million in  versus million in the million difference in acquisition expenditures was mainly due to our acquisition of kinder morgan tejas on january  we continue to invest significantly in strategic acquisitions in order to fuel future growth and increase unitholder value 
these expenditures in are detailed under capital requirements for recent transactions above 
our expenditures in included  i million for kinder morgan tejas  ii million for the remaining ownership interest in trailblazer pipeline company and a contingent interest in trailblazer from cig trailblazer gas company  iii million for certain bulk terminal assets previously owned by mj rudolph corporation and iv million for an additional ownership interest in the cochin pipeline system  which was made effective december  for more information on our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the overall decline in funds used in investing activities in compared to includes a million increase in funds used for capital expenditures and an million reduction in proceeds from sales and retirements of property  plant and equipment 
including expansion and maintenance projects  our capital expenditures were a record million in we spent million for capital expenditures in this million increase was principally due to higher capital investment in our co and products pipelines business segments 
we continue to expand and grow our existing businesses and have current projects in place that will  together with recent acquisitions  significantly add production and throughput capacity to our oil field and carbon dioxide flooding operations  and will add storage and transfer capacity to our terminaling and natural gas businesses 
our sustaining capital expenditures were million for  compared to million for financing activities net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in compared to million in this decrease of million from the prior year was chiefly due to both a million decrease in cash flows from overall debt financing activities and a million decrease in cash flows from partnership equity issuances 
both decreases were related to our higher acquisition expenditures during  as described above 
during each of the years and  we purchased the pipeline and terminal businesses we acquired primarily with borrowings under our commercial paper program 
we subsequently raised funds by completing public and private debt offerings of senior notes and by issuing additional common units and i units 
we used the proceeds from these debt and equity issuances to reduce our borrowings under our commercial paper program 
in  we closed a public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes  resulting in a net cash inflow of million net of discounts and issuing costs  and we borrowed an additional million under our commercial paper program 
we used our commercial paper borrowings to fund our asset acquisitions  capital expansion projects and other partnership activities  and we used the proceeds from the senior note issuance to reduce commercial paper borrowings 
in  we closed a public offering of million in principal amount of senior notes  completed a private placement of million in principal amount of senior notes to qualified institutional buyers we then exchanged these notes in the fourth quarter of with substantially identical notes that are registered under the securities act of and retired a maturing amount of million in principal amount of senior notes 
we also made payments of million to retire the outstanding balance on our trailblazer pipeline company s two year revolving credit facility and used million to reduce our commercial paper borrowings 
the year to year decrease in cash flows from partnership equity issuances primarily relates to the difference in cash received from our june issuance of common units and our august issuance of i units 
in june  we issued  of our common units in a public offering at a price of per share  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
after commissions and underwriting expenses  we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these common units 
in august  we issued  i units to kmr at a price of per share  less commissions and underwriting expenses 
after commissions and underwriting expenses  we received net proceeds of million for the issuance of these i units 
we used the proceeds from each of these issuances to reduce the borrowings under our commercial paper program 
the overall decrease in funds provided by financing activities in compared to also resulted from a million increase in distributions to our partners in compared to the prior year 
cash distributions to all partners  including kmi  increased to million in compared to million in the increase in distributions was due to increases in the per unit cash distributions paid  the number of outstanding units and the resulting increase in the general partner incentive distributions 
we paid distributions of per unit in compared to per unit in the increase in paid distributions per unit resulted from favorable operating results in we also distributed  and  i units in quarterly distributions during and  respectively  to kmr  our sole i unitholder 
the amount of i units distributed in each quarter was based upon the amount of cash we distributed to the owners of our common and class b units during that quarter of and for each outstanding i unit that kmr held  a fraction of an i unit was issued 
the fraction was determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per common unit by the average of kmr s shares closing market prices for the ten consecutive trading days preceding the date on which the shares began to trade ex dividend under the rules of the new york stock exchange 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves including any reserves required under debt instruments for future principal and interest payments and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for future operating expenses  debt service  maintenance capital expenditures  rate refunds and distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed  and  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements  respectively calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash 
the difference between these numbers and reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but retain the cash for use in our business 
available cash is initially distributed to our limited partners and to our general partner 
these distribution percentages are modified to provide for incentive distributions to be paid to our general partner in the event that quarterly distributions to unitholders exceed certain specified targets 
available cash for each quarter is distributed o first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  o third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and o fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for was million  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during was million 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 
on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution was greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of and greater than the distribution per unit we paid for the first quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
litigation and environmental as of december   we have recorded a total reserve for environmental claims in the amount of million 
this reserve is primarily established to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and the costs associated with the effort and to identify if the reserve allocation is appropriately valued 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
after consideration of reserves established  we believe that costs for environmental remediation and ongoing compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations or diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new or existing facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information on our pending environmental and litigation matters  respectively 
we believe we have established adequate environmental and legal reserves such that the resolution of pending environmental matters and litigation will not have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
however  changing circumstances could cause these matters to have a material adverse impact 
regulation on june   ferc issued an interim rule to be effective august  under which regulated companies are required to document cash management arrangements and transactions 
the interim rule does not include a proposed rule that would have required regulated companies  as a prerequisite to participation in cash management programs  to maintain a proprietary capital ratio of and an investment grade credit rating 
on october   the ferc issued its final rule amending its regulations effective november which  among other things  requires ferc regulated entities to file their cash management agreements with the ferc and to notify the ferc within days after the end of the quarter when their proprietary capital ratio drops below  and when it subsequently returns to or exceeds 
kmigt and trailblazer filed their cash management agreements with the ferc on or before the deadline  which was december  on november   the ferc issued order no 
 adopting new standards of conduct to become effective february  every interstate pipeline must file a compliance plan by that date and must be in full compliance with the standards of conduct by june  the primary change from existing regulation is to make such standards applicable to an interstate pipeline s interaction with many more affiliates which are referred to as energy affiliates  including intrastate hinshaw pipelines  processors and gatherers and any company involved in natural gas or electric markets including natural gas marketers even if they do not ship on the affiliated interstate pipeline 
local distribution companies are excluded  however  if they do not make off system sales 
the standards of conduct require  among other things  separate staffing of interstate pipelines and their energy affiliates but support functions and senior management at the central corporate level may be shared and strict limitations on communications from the interstate pipeline to an energy affiliate 
kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc filed for clarification and rehearing of order no 
on december  in the request for rehearing  kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc asked that intrastate hinshaw pipeline affiliates not be included in the definition of energy affiliates 
to date the ferc has not acted on these hearing requests 
on february   kinder morgan interstate gas transmission llc and trailblazer pipeline company filed exemption requests with the ferc 
the pipelines seek a limited exemption from the requirements of order no 
for the purpose of allowing their affiliated hinshaw and intrastate pipelines  which are subject to state regulation and do not make any off system sales  to be excluded from the rule s definition of energy affiliate 
we expect the one time costs of compliance with the order  assuming the request to exempt intrastate pipeline affiliates is granted  to range from  to  to be shared between us and kmi 
the pipeline safety improvement act of was signed into law on december   providing guidelines in the areas of testing  education  training and communication 
the act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as high consequence areas 
pipeline companies are required to perform the integrity tests within ten years of the date of enactment and must perform subsequent integrity tests on a seven year cycle 
at least of the highest risk segments must be tested within five years of the enactment date 
the risk ratings are based on numerous factors  including the population density in the geographic regions served by a particular pipeline  as well as the age and condition of the pipeline and its protective coating 
testing will consist of hydrostatic testing  internal electronic testing  or direct assessment of the piping 
in addition  within one year of the law s enactment  pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained  using criteria the us department of transportation is responsible for providing 
a similar integrity management rule for refined petroleum products pipelines became effective may  all baseline assessments for products pipelines must be completed by march  at least half of the line pipe affecting high consequence areas must be assessed by september  we have included all incremental expenditures estimated to occur during associated with the pipeline safety improvement act of and the integrity management of our products pipelines in our capital expenditure plan

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
upon making that determination  we i ceased to account for those derivatives as hedges  ii entered into new derivative transactions on substantially similar terms with other counterparties to replace our positions with enron  iii designated the replacement derivative positions as hedges of the exposures that had been hedged with the enron positions and iv recognized a million loss included with general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for in recognition of the fact that it was unlikely that we would be paid the amounts then owed under the contracts with enron 
pursuant to our management s approved risk management policy  we are to engage in these activities only as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with o pre existing or anticipated physical natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil sales  o pre existing or anticipated physical carbon dioxide sales that have pricing tied to crude oil prices  o natural gas purchases  and o system use and storage 
our risk management activities are only used in order to protect our profit margins  and our risk management policies prohibit us from engaging in speculative trading 
commodity related activities of our risk management group are monitored by our risk management committee  which is charged with the review and enforcement of our management s risk management policy 
certain of our business activities expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
however  due to the limited size of this exposure  we do not believe the risks associated with changes in foreign currency will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
accordingly  as of december   no financial instruments were used to limit the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial results 
in february  we entered into a single million foreign currency call option that expires on december  through december   gains and losses on hedging positions were deferred and recognized as cost of sales in the periods in which the underlying physical transactions occurred 
on january   we began accounting for derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities after amendment by sfas no 
and sfas no 

as discussed above  our principal use of derivative financial instruments is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
sfas no 
allows these transactions to continue to be treated as hedges for accounting purposes  although the changes in the market value of these instruments will affect comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and any ineffectiveness in the risk mitigation performance of the hedge will affect net income currently 
the change in the market value of these instruments representing effective hedge operation will continue to affect net income in the period in which the associated physical transactions are consummated 
our adoption of sfas no 
has resulted in million of deferred net loss being reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying balance sheet as of december   and million of deferred net loss being reported as accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying balance sheet as of december  we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids  crude oil and carbon dioxide markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the mark to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
financial instruments evaluated by the model include commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options 
for each of the years ended december  and  value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for value at risk as of december   was million and averaged million for our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of a minor amount of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
interest rate risk the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
we utilize both variable rate and fixed rate debt in our financing strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
as of december  and  the carrying values of our long term fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively  compared to fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
the increase in the excess of fair value over carrying value is primarily due to the decrease in interest rates during fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  respectively  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding market value of interest rate swaps  was million as of december  and million as of december fair value was determined using future cash flows discounted based on market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rate applicable to this debt would result in a change of approximately million and million in our and annualized pre tax earnings  respectively 
as of december   we were party to interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal amount of billion for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk associated with our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates related to these swaps would not have a material effect on our annual pre tax earnings in or we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swaps or other interest rate hedging agreements 
as of december   our cash and investment portfolio did not include fixed income securities 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
