the corporation s market presence ranges from the major metropolitan market of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of its headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to approximately miles south to hart county  kentucky 
the corporation s core markets have experienced a solid compound annual growth rate of in deposits for the past four years 
management anticipates a similar growth rate of its markets for the next few years and believes it is well positioned to benefit from this continued growth 
the corporation has positioned itself as a leader in the markets it operates in holding a market share in the five counties south of jefferson county  significantly above the next competitor holding just of the market 
the corporation s presence in jefferson county currently remains under 
however  management believes it can increase its presence in the county  as the primarily market share is held by large out of state holding companies 
we believe that many customers will prefer a banking relationship with an institution headquartered in its region even though many of our competitors in the jefferson county market area have greater resources than we do 
the corporations current branch in jefferson county has achieved a compound annual growth of approximately over the past four years 
in addition  approximately million in commercial loans  primarily commercial real estate  were closed in and  as a result of the customer contacts made within jefferson county 
the corporation s flexibility in loan products  rapid credit approval  and efficient loan closing process has been received with great success 
building upon the success of the commercial lending operations will be the development of a retail presence 
accordingly  the corporation anticipates opening two additional branches in jefferson county by april of although preliminary results have been positive  we are still early in the process 
as is the case in any branch expansion  start up costs will impact the financial performance of the bank for a period of time but we are optimistic that our expansion strategy for jefferson county will minimize this period of time and the long term benefits will outweigh the initial investment 
the corporation is focused on expanding its leadership role in its markets emphasizing both the retail and commercial lines of business 
in addition to expanding its leadership position  the corporation is also focused on maintaining a high level of profitability 
this focus led to the adoption of a strategic initiative to improve return on equity in the corporation identified several key factors to support the initiative including emphasize commercial lending expand our retail base in our current branches as well as in growing markets within our region sustain its excellent credit quality grow non interest income maintain an operationally efficient organization 
since  the corporation has increased its return on equity from in  to in the increase in return on equity was accompanied by a compound annual growth rate of in diluted earning per share over the same period of time 
while management believes opportunities for improvement exist  it attributes much of the improvement in return on equity to various components of the factors of its initiative 
emphasize commercial lending the corporation s emphasis on commercial lending continued to produce positive results generating a million  or increase in commercial loans to million at december   compared to million at december  this favorable trend has resulted in a million  or increase in commercial loans from december   and a million  or increase in commercial loans from december  the percentage of commercial loans in the bank s portfolio has increased from at december   to at december  while residential loans declined from at december   to at december  the portfolio mix also changed significantly during as commercial loans grew to of the total loan portfolio 
management intends to continue this commercial lending emphasis and anticipates continued increases in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios 
expand our retail base in our current branches as well as in growing markets within our region in january  the corporation implemented an effort to develop a bank wide service and sales culture emphasizing expanded account relationships 
to achieve this goal  the corporation increased the number of associates in banking centers  relationship bankers  business development officers  stockbrokers  and loan officers with experience in commercial lending 
the results of this effort have contributed to the growth on the corporation as well as aided it in the transition from a federally chartered thrift to a state chartered commercial bank in january of the increase in staff also contributed to a million  or increase in employee compensation expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  management expects a continued increase in employee compensation expense in the calendar year as it continues its expansion into jefferson county

net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is impacted by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as market interest rates 
net interest income for the year ended december  declined to million compared to million for the period due to a narrowing net interest margin 
the bank s net interest margin declined from for to for the net interest rate spread decreased from during to in the net interest margin declined due to a reduction in short term market interest rates by the federal reserve  which occurred in january customer deposit interest rates did not adjust downward as quickly to offset declining interest yields on loans and investments 
additionally  lower interest rates encouraged a large volume of residential refinancing in favor of the secondary market loans  reducing the bank s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
during the period  residential mortgage loans held in the bank s portfolio decreased by million as a majority of the new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations were sold during the substitution of commercial and commercial real estate loans for residential mortgage loans has resulted in a declining yield on the bank s loan portfolio 
however  the underlying benefits of this strategy have been to substantially reduce interest rate risk and position the bank to improve its net interest margin should interest rates begin to rise

income from brokerage commissions and insurance sales decreased  as a result of a decline in demand for these products 
all other non interest income increased by  during compared to  attributable to a wide variety of customer service fees resulting from the growth in loans and deposits  the sale of two lots previously held for sale and the creation of first heartland title  llc  a subsidiary of the bank that provides title insurance coverage for mortgage borrowers

the new llc generated  in income for the bank for the year ended december  non interest income was million for the six months ended december   compared to million for the period 
the increased level of non interest income during was primarily due to increased service fees on deposit accounts and to a lesser extent  gain on sale of mortgage loans 
offsetting these increases were slight decreases in brokerage and insurance commissions and other income

gain on sale of mortgage loans increased by  or for compared to as declining market interest rates continued an increase in consumer refinance activity of family fixed rate residential loans  which the bank sells into the secondary market through its subsidiary  first heartland mortgage company 
mortgage banking income depends upon loan demand and refinance volume which management anticipates will continue at or near current levels for at least the next quarter  but less than pace of first half of income from brokerage commissions and insurance sales decreased  as a result of a decline in demand for these products 
other income decreased during the period by  due to increases in customer fees waived and increased losses on repossessed assets attributed to the indirect dealer loan program

non interest expense non interest expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to the most significant factors impacting non interest expense for the period include an increase in staffing levels and employee benefits expense  and a change in accounting rules that discontinued amortization of goodwill from acquisitions 
management anticipates moderate increases in non interest expense are likely going forward as the bank broke ground during may on two traditional banking centers in higher growth market areas in louisville  kentucky 
these banking centers are expected to open during the march and june quarters 
the bank intends to close its existing supermarket banking center located within one half mile of the southern louisville banking center currently under construction 
non interest expense levels are often measured using an efficiency ratio non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non interest income 
a lower efficiency ratio is indicative of higher bank performance 
the bank s efficiency ratios were and for the years ended december  and employee compensation and benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased million or for the increase in employee compensation reflects higher incentive bonuses due to certain corporate performance objectives being met  coupled with growth in the overall staffing level from full time equivalent employees at december  to full time equivalent employees at december  during the year  ten new retail positions have been filled in preparation of the upcoming expansions into jefferson county  kentucky  coupled with an expanded facility in hardin county  kentucky 
staff increased during as management continues to emphasize the bank s retail sales culture and to expand the products and services we can offer to our retail and commercial customers 
as a result of adopting new accounting standards on july   the corporation ceased annual amortization of  on remaining goodwill assets of million 
accordingly  no amortization expense was recognized for the year ended december  or the six months ended december  the new standards require annual impairment testing for goodwill with impairment being recorded if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
these tests have not resulted in any impairments 
all other non interest expenses increased  to million during the period compared to non interest expense increased by  or during the six month period ended december  compared to the same period in factors impacting non interest expense included an increase in staffing levels and a change in accounting rules in which goodwill amortization expense from acquisitions is no longer recorded

goodwill amortization expense reported for the six months ended december  was  compared to zero for the six months ended december  non interest expense increased by million or during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the increase principally resulted from higher staffing levels  increased marketing efforts for the bank s promotional products as well as increases in other expense 
the bank s efficiency ratio was in compared to in employee compensation and benefits increased  or for the increase reflects growth in the overall staffing level from full time equivalent employees at june  to at june  marketing and advertising costs increased during by  or

the remainder of non interest expense categories increased by a net of  or during the increase is primarily attributable to increases in costs associated with the overdraft program  costs associated with postage  stationary and supplies and other customer account expenses 
analysis of financial condition the corporation s total assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december  the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios increased during the period due to investments in equity securities and two mortgage backed securities with fixed rate terms of five and seven years 
also  during the period  the bank invested million in bank owned life insurance 
net loans including loans held for sale increased million from december  to million at december  residential mortgage loans decreased by million during the period as declining market interest rates caused an increase in family refinancing activity into fixed rate  secondary market loan products 
the bank s emphasis on commercial lending continued to produce positive results generating a million  or increase in commercial loans to million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  the bank hired an automotive dealer loan specialist to expand its dealer loan program  which increased million to million at december   and is expected to continue to increase 
the corporation s total assets at december  decreased slightly to million compared to million at june  the decrease in assets was primarily due to the decrease in the bank s cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits  a direct result of the decrease in retail deposits 
further  the investment portfolio decreased as interest rates declined and securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms 
offsetting the decline in securities  net loans including loans held for sale increased million from june  to million at december  residential mortgage loans decreased by million during the period as declining market interest rates encouraged homeowners to refinance residential loans in favor of fixed rate  secondary market loan products 
the growth in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios remained strong increasing by million to million at december  this growth is a result of the bank s continued emphasis on the active pursuit of lending opportunities that meet its lending criteria

periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the allowance is determined based on the application of loss estimates to graded loans by categories 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is also based upon an analysis of such factors  as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
the methodology for allocating the allowance for loan and lease losses takes into account the bank s strategic plan to increase its emphasis on commercial and consumer lending 
the bank increases the amount of the allowance allocated to commercial loans and consumer loans in response to the growth of the commercial and consumer loan portfolios and management s recognition of the higher risks and loan losses in these lending areas 
the indirect consumer loan program begun in is comprised of new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicle loans originated on behalf of the bank by a select group of auto dealers within the bank s service area 
the indirect loan program involves a greater degree of risk and is evaluated quarterly and monitored by the board of directors 
in light of the greater charge offs from indirect consumer loans compared to direct consumer loans  proportionally more of the allowance for consumer loans is allocated for indirect loans than direct loans 
as the indirect loan program has evolved  dealer analysis and underwriting standards have been refined to improve the loan loss experience of the program 
in addition  the bank has hired a dealer loan specialist to expand its dealer loan program 
estimating the allowance is a continuous process 
in this regard  the executive loan committee continues to monitor the performance of indirect consumer loans as well as the bank s other loan products and updates its estimates as the evidence warrants

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention and a specific allowance category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the bank s loan portfolio  the bank had million of assets classified substandard  million classified as doubtful  million classified as special mention and  of assets classified as loss 
loans are classified according to estimated loss as follows substandard to  doubtful to  loss  and special mention to 
the bank additionally provides a reserve estimate for probable incurred losses in non classified loans ranging from 
to 
although the bank may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
allowance estimates are developed by the bank in consultation with regulatory authorities  actual loss experience and are adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk of the bank s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
the bank does not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans under sfas  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  the bank institutes measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible by management and any available collateral has been disposed of 
commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis by management with the advice of the bank s legal counsel 
the bank anticipates that the volume of non performing real estate loans will continue to increase  reflecting anticipated growth of the bank s loan portfolio 
interest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans in a nonaccrual of income status 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when interest accrual is discontinued  existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
real estate acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired by the bank as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
any write down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense

premises and equipment premises and equipment increased by million due to the purchase of three lots and the reclassification of land previously classified as held for development 
two of the lots are located in high growth market areas in louisville  kentucky 
the bank is currently constructing two traditional banking centers on these lots 
the banking centers are anticipated to be operational during the march and june quarters 
the bank has developed a unique building design for all future banking centers to brand its image 
deposits first federal attracts both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years the bank has been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
the bank uses forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring the bank s use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of their use on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
the bank relies primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect the bank s ability to attract and retain deposits 
during the year ended december   deposits increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in retail deposits was primarily in savings and money market accounts due to growth in public entity deposits for the period 
during the six months ended december   retail deposits decreased by million to million at december  compared to million at june   primarily in certificate of deposit accounts  caused in part by the bank s deposit customers shifting funds to higher interest earning products at other financial institutions 
the bank s strategic plan includes a focus toward increasing non interest bearing accounts and non interest income  in addition to maintaining the current interest margin 
non relationship certificate customers lack the fee income from other products and represent high cost funding that can be replaced by current liquidity or fhlb advances as needed 
to evaluate the funding needs of the bank in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
the bank continues to offer attractive certificate rates for longer terms to allow the bank to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current low rate environment  while protecting the margin when interest rates increase as the economy recovers 
first federal offers statement and passbook savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
first federal also offers tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of the bank s deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by management on a periodic basis 
first federal also offers certificates of deposit with a variety of terms and interest rates 
these certificates have minimum deposit requirements as well 
the variety of deposit accounts allows first federal to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  the ability of the bank to attract and maintain deposits and its cost of funds have been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by market conditions 
the holders of the bank s certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more are all non brokered depositors  most of whom reside within our service areas 
the bank does not accept brokered deposits  which are funds deposited by an investment dealer on behalf of a third party investor 
the bank s policy is to maintain certificate of deposit accounts in amounts of  or more  to the extent practical  only when the depositor uses other bank products to increase the total customer relationship 
the objective is to provide the bank with a stable deposit base of large account balances while increasing the fee income and lower funding costs through other products and services 
the following table breaks down the bank s deposits as of december  category balances percent of deposits non interest bearing demand accounts  now demand accounts  savings accounts  money market deposit accounts  certificates of deposit  individual retirement accounts  the following table shows at december  the amount of the bank s certificates of deposit of  or more by time remaining until maturity 
maturity period certificates of deposit in thousands three months or less  three through six months  six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  borrowings deposits are the primary source of funds for first federal s lending and investment activities and for its general business purposes 
the bank can also use advances borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati to supplement its supply of lendable funds  meet deposit withdrawal requirements and extend the term of its liabilities 
advances from the fhlb are secured by the bank s stock in the fhlb and substantially all of the bank s first mortgage loans 
at december  first federal had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase its borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  first federal is required to own capital stock in the fhlb and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of its home mortgages and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that it meets certain standards related to creditworthiness 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
the following table sets forth information about the bank s fhlb advances during the periods indicated 
december  june  dollars in thousands average balance outstanding     maximum amount outstanding at any month end during the period  year end balance     weighted average interest rate at end of year during the year liquidity the bank must maintain sufficient liquidity to fund loan demand and routine deposit withdrawal activity 
liquidity is managed by retaining sufficient liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
additional sources of funding and cash flows include the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal paydowns on loans and mortgage backed securities and proceeds realized from loans held for sale 
the corporation s banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to the bank s competitors or the stock market in response to interest rate changes  the bank has the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  the bank has also utilized borrowings from the fhlb to supplement its funding requirements 
at december   the bank had an unused approved line of credit in the amount of million and sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
capital during the year ended december   the corporation purchased  shares of its own common stock 
as a result  total capital decreased by million  which in turn reduced consolidated regulatory capital 
the corporation and the bank continued to qualify as well capitalized under regulatory guidelines after the transaction 
the corporation s stock repurchase programs have generally authorized the repurchase of up to of the corporation s outstanding stock from time to time in the open market or private transactions during an month period 
management considers repurchasing shares when the financial and other terms of the purchase and its impact on earnings per share and other financial measures offer an attractive return to stockholders 
the corporation adopted its most recent plan on march  regulatory agencies measure capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements  in part  dependent on the individual risk profiles of financial institutions 
the corporation on a consolidated basis and the bank continue to exceed the regulatory requirements for tier i  tier i leverage and total risk based capital 
management intends to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the well capitalized requirements as defined by the fdic 
the bank s average stockholders equity to average assets ratio declined to for the year ended december  compared to for period due principally to stock repurchases 
on march   a trust formed by of the corporation completed the private placement of  shares of cumulative trust preferred securities with a liquidation preference of  per security 
the proceeds of the offering were loaned to the corporation in exchange for floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
distributions on the securities are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the month libor plus 
the corporation undertook the issuance of these securities to enhance its regulatory capital position as they are considered as tier i capital under current regulatory guidelines 
the corporation intends to utilize the proceeds for general business purposes and to support the bank s future opportunities for growth 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kdfi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
at december   the bank had approximately million of retained earnings that could be utilized for payment of dividends if authorized by its board of directors without prior regulatory approval 
off balance sheet arrangements aggregate contractual obligations december  total less than one year greater than one year to years greater than years to years more than years dollars in thousands off balance sheet items commitments to make loans unused lines of credit     standby letters of credit   fhlb letters of credit   aggregate contractual obligations fhlb borrowings   subordinated debentures   lease commitments  commitments to make loans and unused lines of credit assure the borrower of financing for a specified period of time at a specified rate as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract such as deterioration of the borrower s financial condition 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as the risk involved in issuing loan commitments and extending credit 
the bank obtained letters of credit from the fhlb to be used to collateralize public deposits 
these letters of credit are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible one to four family residential mortgage loans 
fhlb borrowings represent the amounts that are due to the fhlb of cincinnati 
these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
some of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb or the company can prepay these advances without a penalty 
management does not believe these advances will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature march   are redeemable prior to the maturity date at the option of the corporation on or after march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust debenture 
the corporation has the option to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on the bank s loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  the bank manages its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management polices of the corporation 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be the bank s most significant market risk 
the bank utilizes an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income are then evaluated 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of the bank s deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
the bank s interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at both december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  the bank s base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates the bank s base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  the interest sensitivity of the corporation at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities as well as their relative pricing schedules 
it is also influenced by market interest rates  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
our previous disclosures of sensitivity included growth rates for loans and deposits 
to provide improved period to period comparisons  the tables are now presented without these growth estimates 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables presented below  the bank is transitioning from a liability sensitive to an asset sensitive position as compared to prior periods 
the change in the bank s asset sensitivity is a result of changes in the loan portfolio to a greater extent than changes in the investment portfolio 
while lending practices have shifted to shorter term  variable rate commercial and consumer loans  that impact will be evidenced in smaller degrees over time 
the corporation s sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans      investments      total interest income      projected interest expense deposits      borrowed funds      total interest expense     net interest income change from base   change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates basis points basis points base basis points basis points dollars in thousands projected interest income loans      investments     total interest income      projected interest expense deposits      borrowed funds      total interest expense     net interest income change from base  change from base
