the forward looking statements in this report speak only as of the date of this report and we do not undertake to revise or update any of them 
we urge you to review and carefully consider the various disclosures we make in this report and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report and the section of this report titled factors that may affect future results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and could potentially produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the application of the following critical accounting policies and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales after the inventory has cleared customs  if necessary  and upon pick up by a common carrier for free on board fob origin shipments 
for fob destination shipments  sales are recorded upon delivery to the customer 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns  as long as no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
generally  product sales are not contingent upon customer testing  approval and or acceptance 
however  if sales require customer acceptance or include post delivery obligations  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or fulfillment of any post delivery obligations 
we record revenue from equipment maintenance contracts as deferred revenue when billed and recognize the revenue as earned over the period in which the services are provided  primarily straight line over the term of the contract 
we consider sales contracts that include a combination of systems  software or services to be multiple deliverable arrangements 
revenue recognition with multiple deliverables whereby software is incidental to the overall product solution is governed by eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
an item is considered a separate element if it involves a separate earnings process 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we employ the 
table of contents residual method  whereby we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined by examining renewed service contracts and based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately or prices provided by vendors if sufficient standalone sales information is not available 
undelivered elements typically include installation  training  warranty  maintenance and professional services 
the calculation of fair value is a complex estimate subject to many changing factors 
if the calculated fair value of undelivered elements changes  it could result in a significant impact to the amount of revenue recognized and deferred on new multiple element transactions 
for sales transactions that include software products which are more than incidental to the overall product solution  we apply statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  whereby the residual method is employed 
revenue is recognized from software licenses  provided the software has been delivered to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price charged to the customer is fixed or determinable and there are no significant obligations on our part related to the sale and the resulting receivable is deemed collectible  net of an allowance for returns and cancellations 
we recognize revenue from maintenance agreements ratably over the term of the related agreement 
maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
revenue from consulting and other software related services is recognized as the services are rendered 
we may allow our customers who purchase new equipment to trade in used equipment to reduce the purchase price under the sales contract 
these trade in credits are considered discounts and are allocated to the delivered elements governed by eitf thus  product revenue from trade in transactions is recognized net of trade in value 
we consider sales transactions that are initiated by emc and jointly negotiated and closed by emc and our sales force as partner assisted transactions pats 
we recognize revenue from pats on a gross basis because we bear the risk of returns and collectability of the full accounts receivable 
product revenue of the delivered items is recorded at residual value upon pick up by a common carrier for fob origin shipments 
for fob destination shipments  product revenue is recorded upon delivery to the customer 
if we subcontract the undelivered items such as maintenance and professional services to emc  we record the costs of those items as deferred costs and amortize the costs using the straight line method over the life of the contract 
we defer the revenue for the undelivered items at fair value based upon contracted prices with emc according to eitf at times  our customers prefer to enter into service agreements directly with emc 
in this instance  we assign the obligation to perform services to emc and  therefore  we do not record revenue nor defer any costs related to the services 
finally  upon assignment of maintenance and professional services to emc  emc may elect to subcontract the professional services to us 
in this case  we defer the revenue for the professional services at fair value according to eitf product warranty 
we record warranty expense at the time revenue is recognized and maintain a warranty accrual for the estimated future warranty obligation based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs and sales volumes 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty calls and repair cost 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we reviewed our historical costs of warranty for emc products sold over the last nine months  since we entered into the reseller agreement with emc 
based on our review  and given the favorable warranty rate experienced on emc products to date  we determined that it was not necessary to record any additional provision for warranty related to emc products for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year we will continue to assess the adequacy of our warranty accrual each quarter and we will begin to record warranty provision on emc products sold beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the recorded warranty rate for emc products will likely be lower than fiscal given our favorable warranty experience with emc products 
should actual warranty calls and repair cost differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated returns and losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services 
table of contents rendered 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
all new customers are reviewed for credit worthiness upon initiation of the sales process 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes  which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for income taxes  under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  net of a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as management has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
upon the adoption of statement and the completion of the transitional impairment test in fiscal year  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
we completed our annual assessment for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year based upon factors such as the market valuation approach  comparison between the reporting units estimated fair value using discounted cash flow projections over the next three years  and carrying value  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within this analysis could produce significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
we will update our assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year or as other facts and circumstances indicate 
inventories 
our inventory consists of logistics inventory and production inventory 
logistics inventory is used for product under maintenance contracts and warranty  and is not for sale 
as of april  we had net logistics inventory of million  of which substantially all of such inventory is related to legacy products  and net production inventory of million 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  net of an allowance for obsolete  slow moving  and unsalable inventory 
the allowance is based upon management s review of inventories on hand  historical product sales  and future sales forecasts 
historically  we used rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component and product inventory requirements 
as a reseller  we procure inventory primarily upon receipt of purchase orders from customers  as such  the risk of emc production inventory obsolescence is low 
our logistics inventory reserve is based on a combined analysis of historical usage  current and anticipated maintenance contract renewals and future product sales 
if we overestimate our product or component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which could lead to additional excess and obsolete charges 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charges operating loss other income  net gain loss on foreign currency transactions equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate income tax expense benefit net loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal year increased million  or from fiscal year this increase was comprised of a million and a million  or and  increase in domestic product and international product revenue  respectively 
the increase in net product revenue is primarily a result of entering into the emc reseller agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal our ability to sell these products enabled us to further penetrate the mid range storage market as evidenced by the addition of new customer accounts during fiscal year also contributing to the increase in net product revenue was the addition of a vice president of us sales  with years of storage experience  responsible for north american sales  and five additional veteran salespersons during fiscal who accounted for million or of total net product revenue in fiscal the increase in net product revenue was driven primarily by strong demand for emc server and software products  which generally have a higher average selling price than our proprietary products 
server and software products increased from fiscal by million and million  respectively  offset by a decrease of million from tape library sales 
the decline in tape library revenue is attributable to a shift in focus towards developing expertise selling the emc product set 
service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was attributable to decreased maintenance revenue of million  offset by increased professional services revenue of million 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we became a reseller and service provider of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
commencing with the sale of the emc array of products  most emc hardware products are sold with up to a 
table of contents year x warranty 
as a result  the revenue associated with post warranty service contracts for those hardware product sales will not occur until expiration of the warranty period 
therefore  service revenues decreased from fiscal year to fiscal year however  as sales of emc products increase  we expect that sales of back up products  which are not a part of the emc reseller s agreement  will increase and those products carry shorter warranty periods thus providing the opportunity for increased maintenance contracts 
another factor that contributed to the decrease in maintenance revenue is the expiration of maintenance contracts without offsetting renewed and new maintenance contracts related to mti branded products 
in order to mitigate these decreases  during fiscal we became a member of the emc authorized services network and are now able to provide end to end service for emc s clariion family of systems 
product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal year  an increase of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the increase in product gross profit was primarily the result of an increase in product sales  principally emc server and software products  coupled with a million reduction in inventory obsolescence related charges as compared to fiscal year  partially offset by lower standard product margin percentages on a transaction by transaction basis 
service gross profit service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year we attribute the decreases in service gross profit to reduced field service revenue  particularly maintenance revenue which is supported by a relatively fixed cost structure 
in an effort to improve our service gross profit  the following actions have been taken effective october   we outsourced our domestic customer response center operations to directpointe  inc  a related party  for a minimum monthly charge of million  and in the third quarter of fiscal year  we eliminated eight full time positions in our field service operations 
we expect these reductions to provide quarterly cost savings of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a or million decrease in fixed charges such as depreciation  rent  insurance  property taxes and utilities expenses  a or million decrease in marketing expense  an or million decrease in outside purchases such as consulting and professional services  tax services  bank fees and bad debt expense and an or million decrease in supplies 
the decrease in fixed charges was primarily the current year impact of asset disposals and facilities abandonments in the prior fiscal year 
the decreases in marketing  outside purchases and supplies expenses were the result of a directed program to cut expenses in order to return to profitability the above decreases were offset by a or million increase in salary and benefits expense and a or million increase in travel and lodging expense 
these increases were a result of increased headcount in our sales department 
also  during fiscal year  we recovered million from accounts that were previously determined to be uncollectible  as compared to bad debt expense of million in fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from the headcount reductions that occurred primarily during fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  decreases in outside consulting expense of million  decreases in rent  utilities  repair and maintenance  depreciation  insurance and property tax expenses of million and decreases in travel and lodging and supplies expenses of million 
these decreases were the result of our change to our business model from the sale of mti branded products to the sale of co branded solutions serving the storage and enhanced data protection market 
restructuring charges we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million in fiscal this was the result of a reversal of the restructuring reserve in the second quarter of fiscal year of million due to higher than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees and usage of space in our westmont  illinois facilities 
this benefit was partially offset by an additional charge in the first quarter of fiscal year of 
table of contents million due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our sunnyvale  california facility 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal year  which consisted of charges of approximately million related to a headcount reduction of employees  or of our workforce  and million related to the disposal or abandonment of fixed assets 
of the employees terminated       and were from the sales  marketing  general and administrative  customer service  research and development  and manufacturing departments  respectively 
the cash outflow of the restructuring charge is million related to severance  which was paid during fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our sunnyvale  california and raleigh  north carolina facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our european facilities 
the changes to the restructuring reserve from its inception in the fourth quarter of fiscal year are as follows in millions abandoned facilities balance as of april  add fiscal year restructuring charges less fiscal year utilization balance as of april  less fiscal year restructuring reversal less fiscal year utilization balance as of april  workforce reduction balance as of april  add fiscal year severance charges less fiscal year severance payments balance as of april  and april  total accrued restructuring  as of april  other income  net other income  net  which includes interest income and expense  in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the million gain on the sale of a security investment included in fiscal year additional interest expense of million in fiscal year due to higher borrowings on the line of credit also contributed to the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by million in interest income related to the irs refund recorded in fiscal year gain loss on foreign currency transactions we recorded a million gain on foreign currency transactions during fiscal year  as compared to a million gain in fiscal year during fiscal year  the euro appreciated against the us dollar in approximately the same percentage as compared to fiscal year  however  these foreign currency gains were offset by losses caused by the appreciation of the british pound sterling against the euro 
income taxes we recorded a net tax benefit of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax expense of million for fiscal year the net tax benefit is due to the irs settlement on income tax audits for fiscal years through which resulted in a tax payable of million for which we had accrued million and an income tax receivable of million for fiscal years through based 
table of contents upon the carry back of the net operating losses which were confirmed by the irs for the fiscal years through fiscal year compared to fiscal year net product revenue net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was primarily because of a million and a million  or and  decrease in domestic product and international product revenue  respectively 
in terms of product mix on a worldwide basis  this decrease was the result of decreased revenue of million  million and million from server products  tape libraries and tape related software products  respectively 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume rather than average sales price 
in general  we have found that our customer base has become much more cautious in its buying patterns and purchasing is being confined to an as needed basis  with increasing levels of customer justification and management approval required during the sales process 
this more difficult sales environment was partially a result  but not solely a result  of the global economic downturn  coupled with the us war against iraq 
as a result  our customers delayed or reduced their expenditures  including those for information technology  thus decreasing the current demand for our information storage systems and software 
additionally  aggressive competition in the form of pricing discounts offered by hitachi data systems  hewlett packard company  sun microsystems  inc  ibm  and network appliance  inc  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  marketing capabilities and financial and personnel resources than we have  have contributed to the decrease in our sales 
service revenue service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was attributable to decreased maintenance revenue of million  decreased consulting revenue of million and other decreased service revenue of million 
the decrease in maintenance revenue is primarily due to the expiration of maintenance contracts without offsetting renewed and new maintenance contracts 
we attribute the lower number of renewals to the loss of customers to our competitors  customers that have updated their technology which is now covered by warranty  and customers that have ceased operations 
the decrease in consulting and other revenue is primarily attributable to decreased product revenue 
in fiscal year  we changed our service and business systems operations throughout the world to operate under one leadership in an attempt to minimize duplication of costs  increase efficiencies and exploit successful operations 
product gross profit product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to continued pricing pressures and changes in product mix 
in fiscal year  we sold more library and software products than server products  particularly the vivant product family  and library and software products carry lower margins than server products 
the unfavorable change in product mix was partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies  our ability to sell million of non vivant inventory that was previously fully reserved and reduced inventory charges from million  which consisted primarily of additional reserves for gladiator  and inventories  in the fiscal year to million  which consisted primarily of reserves for vivant  vcache and s  in fiscal year service gross profit service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year in addition to the relatively fixed cost structure  we attribute the decreases in service gross profit to a decrease in domestic customer service revenue  particularly maintenance revenue  partially offset by a increase in international customer service revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  over fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a or million decrease in salary and benefit expenses which resulted from reduced headcounts of  a or million decrease in outside purchases such as consulting and professional services  tax services  bank fees 
table of contents and bad debt expense  a or million decrease in marketing and promotional expenses  an or million decrease in fixed charges such as rent and utilities expenses  a or million decrease in supplies and telecommunication expenses  and a or million decrease in travel and lodging expenses 
during fiscal year  we recovered million from accounts that were previously determined to be uncollectible  as compared to bad debt expense of million in the preceding fiscal year 
the decreased expenditures were the result of a directed program to bring expenditures in line with the reduced product and service revenues and resultant margins noted above 
research and development expenses research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from a headcount reduction over fiscal year  decreases in project costs of million  decreases in rent  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  depreciation  insurance and property tax expenses of million  decreases in travel and lodging  consulting and loss on disposal of fixed assets of million  and decreases in communication expenses of million 
as part of our change in business model we have changed our emphasis from the sale of mti branded products to the sale of co branded solutions serving the storage and enhanced data protection market 
our focus towards emc networked storage systems will result in limited partnering of products beyond the emc line of products and those products related to backup functions 
the primary goal of the restructuring was to refocus on the design and implementation of storage solutions at a significantly lower cost 
in support of this  our engineering department has been redeployed within our professional services organization 
other income  net other income  net  which includes interest income and expense  in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to an absence of income from sale of patents to emc as we received the final annual payment in advance of million from the sale of certain patents in january and recorded the payments as other income proportionately during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first nine months of fiscal year thus  we recorded other income of related to the sale of patents in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year other factors contributing to the decrease in other income  net  were decreases in interest income and sales tax refund 
these decreases were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a security investment of million in fiscal year equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate equity in net loss of affiliate for fiscal year represents our proportionate share of the sco group  inc s sco net losses and amortization of the goodwill related to the investment made in sco in august the original investment in sco was million and included a cash payment of million  b note payable of million bearing interest at the prime rate plus one percent per annum and payable in two equal semi annual payments beginning february and c investment costs of million  including the issuance of a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the excess of our investment in sco over the related underlying equity in net assets of million was being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
however  we adopted statement as of april   the beginning of fiscal year  and therefore  ceased to amortize the remaining balance of goodwill related to the investment in sco of million  which was written off during the third quarter of fiscal year due to an other than temporary decline in value and recognizing our proportional share of sco s net loss 
such loss has been included in equity in net loss and write down of net investmentof affiliate in our fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
gain loss on foreign currency transactions we recorded a million gain on foreign currency transactions during fiscal year  as compared to a million loss in fiscal year the million increase in the gain on foreign currency transactions was primarily due to the weakening us dollar against the euro 
income taxes we recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax expense of million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a net tax expense of million of which million was related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year because of the continued decline in the market value of our investment in sco and continued softness in the domestic and european markets for our products  management believed 
table of contents that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets existing on april  liquidity and capital resources as of april   working capital was million  as compared to million at the end of the prior fiscal year  and we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of april   as compared to million as of april  the million decrease in cash and cash equivalents was the result of net cash used in operating and investing activities of million and million  respectively  partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities of million and million from the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year contributing to the net cash used in operating activities was the current year net loss of million as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
this usage was partially offset by million in non cash expenses 
if we are able to execute our growth strategy  we expect cash used in operations to decrease significantly in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased revenue generated from sales of emc products as well as increased revenue from our professional services organization 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year used cash of million 
this usage was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
due to our plan to increase headcount in fiscal year  we expect that our capital expenditures will increase mainly due to the purchase of additional computer equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal year current year borrowings on the line of credit provided cash of million which was partially offset by payments on the line of credit and capital lease obligations of million and million  respectively 
proceeds from the issuance of shares and exercise of options and warrants provided cash of million 
in november  we entered into a loan agreement with comerica bank for a line of credit of million at an interest rate equal to the prime rate 
the line of credit is secured by a letter of credit that is guaranteed by the canopy group  inc canopy  our major stockholder 
canopy s guarantee was to mature on november   but on june   we received an extension on the million letter of credit until june  the comerica loan agreement was to mature on october   but on june   we received a renewal on the line of credit for million until may  on june   we received an additional extension on the letter of credit until june  also on june   we received an additional renewal on the comerica line of credit until may  ralph j 
yarro  iii  one of our directors  is also a director  president and chief executive officer of canopy 
darcy g 
mott  one of our directors  is also a vice president  treasurer and chief financial officer of canopy 
canopy beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the comerica loan agreement contains negative covenants placing restrictions on our ability to engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in  suffer or permit a change in control  and merge with or acquire another entity 
although we are currently in compliance with all of the terms of the comerica loan agreement  and believe that we will remain in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to borrow under the comerica loan agreement through the expiration date 
upon an event of default  comerica may terminate the comerica loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable 
as of april   there was million outstanding and million available for borrowing under the comerica line of credit 
on june   the company sold  shares of series a convertible preferred stock in a private placement financing at per share  which raised million in gross proceeds  before consideration of professional fees 
the sale included issuance to the investors of warrants to purchase  shares of the 
table of contents company s common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the shares of common stock into which the warrants are exercisable represent twenty five percent of the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which the series a convertible preferred stock are convertible plus an additional  shares of common stock 
each share of series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into common stock at an initial conversion rate of ten shares of common stock for each share of series a convertible preferred stock  subject to adjustments upon certain dilutive issuances of securities by the company at the initial stated price per share 
the series a convertible preferred stock carries a cumulative dividend of per year payable when and if declared by the board of directors 
the warrants are exercisable on or after december   and expire on june  as part of the private placement  a representative of the investors has joined the company s board of directors 
the company s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents  the comerica line of credit under the comerica loan agreement and expected cash flows from operations 
fiscal year represented our first full year of operations under our reseller agreement with emc 
since the inception of this relationship  we have recorded sequential quarterly growth in both product revenues and total revenues and reduced our operating loss by 
we believe that as we continue to execute our growth strategy  we will see increased liquidity through cash generated by operating activities 
we believe that our current working capital  coupled with the borrowing ability under the comerica line of credit as well as the cash generated from the sale of the series a convertible preferred stock is adequate to fund operations for at least the next months 
we believe that the increase in liquidity as a result of the series a convertible preferred stock offering will provide us with the required capital to grow our business and improve profitability 
using the proceeds from the offering  we plan to add experienced sales professionals in our sales organization and add technical professionals in our professional services organization 
our future growth is dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified personnel  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing assets 
in particular  significant growth will require that we train  integrate and retain qualified sales personnel in various geographic regions 
the inability to recruit  train and retain additional personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results 
the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of april  payments due by fiscal period total thereafter in millions line of credit operating lease obligations capital lease obligations inflation and foreign currency exchange we recorded a million foreign exchange gain during fiscal year  which resulted from the weakening us dollar against the euro  partially offset by the appreciation of the british pound sterling against the euro 
in fiscal  approximately of total revenue was generated outside the united states  particularly in germany  france and the united kingdom 
sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar expose us to market risk from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
in fiscal year  we did not enter into forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currency to fix the us dollar amount we will receive on sales denominated in that currency 
historically  in order to minimize the risk of foreign exchange loss  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  in order to conserve cash  we ended our hedging program in fiscal year 
table of contents the company has assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in ireland  germany  france and the united kingdom 
the company s investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge these net investments

the sections entitled factors that may affect future results  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business contain a discussion of some of the factors that could contribute to those differences 
factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
we are dependent upon emc as the main supplier for our storage solutions  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in costs could harm our business materially 
effective march   we became a reseller of emc storage products 
therefore  we depend on emc to manufacture and supply us with their storage products 
we may fail to obtain required storage products in a timely manner or to obtain it in the quantities we desire in the future 
if emc were to decide to modify their channel strategy  they may cease supplying us with their storage products 
if emc were to unexpectedly cancel the reseller agreement  we may be unable to find other vendors as a replacement in a timely manner 
any interruption or delay in the supply of emc storage products  or the inability to obtain these products at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
this lost storage product revenue could harm our business  financial condition and operating results rendering us unable to continue operation at our current level of operations 
the storage market is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success will depend on emc s ability to develop new products 
the market for data storage products is characterized by rapid technology changes 
the market is sensitive to changes in customer demands and very competitive with respect to timely innovation 
new product introductions representing new or improved technology or industry standards may cause our existing products to be obsolete 
when we became a reseller of emc disk based storage products  we agreed to not sell data storage hardware platforms that compete with emc products 
emc s ability to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis at competitive price levels will affect our future results 
we are exposed to general economic conditions 
our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
the downturn of the economy and delays or reductions in information technology spending in prior years had adversely affected our operating results 
if economic conditions deteriorate  our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents the markets for the products and services that we sell are intensely competitive which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share for our business 
the market for our products and services are intensely competitive 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
furthermore  new products and technologies developed by third parties may depress the sales of existing products and technologies 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
since we have placed emphasis on integrating third party products  our ability to respond to new technologies will be substantially dependent upon our contractual relationships with such manufacturers 
in addition  we must be able to quickly and effectively train our employees with respect to any new products or technologies developed by our third party suppliers and resold by us 
since the third party products we sell are available from a large number of sources  we must distinguish ourselves by the quality of our service and support 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include quality of professional services consulting and support  responsiveness to customer and market needs  product price  quality  reliability and performance  and ability to sell  service and deploy new technology 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  hitachi and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  marketing capabilities  financial  technological  and personnel resources than we do 
our future operating results may depend on the success of our cost reduction initiatives 
we have implemented restructuring activities in an effort to reduce costs 
these measures included reductions in our workforce and the partial or complete closure of certain under utilized facilities  including offices in sunnyvale  california  boston  massachusetts  austin  texas  denver  colorado  orlando  florida  westmont  illinois  raleigh  north carolina  dublin  ireland  godalming  england  and chatou  france 
we reduced the number of our full time employees by approximately within the last two fiscal years from as of april   to as of april  
our cost reduction initiatives may fail to reduce expenses significantly enough to compensate for decreases in margin and revenue 
please see significant business developments financial restructurings and reductions in staff 
we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of our workforce reductions 
reductions in our workforce could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations  as well as make it difficult to motivate and retain the remaining employees  which would affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and otherwise negatively affect our business 
we also cannot assure you that these measures will be successful in achieving the expected benefits within the expected time frames or that the workforce reductions will not impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 
we may need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations  and such additional financing may not be available 
we require substantial working capital to fund our operations 
we use cash generated from our operations  equity capital and bank financings to fund capital expenditures  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations 
we believe that our working capital  expected cash flow from operating activities and amounts available under the comerica loan agreement will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
projections for our capital requirements are subject to numerous uncertainties  including the cost savings expected to be realized from the restructuring  the amount of service and product revenue generated in fiscal and general economic conditions 
if we do not realize substantial 
table of contents cost savings from our restructuring and achieve profitability  we may require additional funds in order to carry on our operations  and may seek to raise such funds through bank borrowings or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
if additional financing is required but not available to us  we would have to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
our failure to raise required additional funds or to secure an additional credit facility would adversely affect our ability to grow the business  maintain or enhance our product offerings  respond to competitive pressures  or continue operations 
additional funds raised through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock may have the following negative effects on the then current holders of our common stock dilution in percentage of ownership in mti  and subordination of the rights  preferences or privileges of common stockholders to the rights  preferences or privileges of new security holders 
a significant portion of our revenues occurs in the last month of a given quarter 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may be difficult to predict 
we have experienced  historically  a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly to increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter extremely difficult and uncertain 
if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be harmed materially for that quarter 
additionally  due to receiving a significant portion of our orders in the last month of the quarter  we may experience a situation in which we have exceeded our credit limits with our vendors thereby making our ability to ship to our customers impossible 
if we experience such situations and are unable to extend our credit limits with our vendors  this could materially harm our results of operations 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be indicative of future results or be helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we anticipate that these fluctuations may continue into the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the size  timing and terms of customer orders  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of best of breed products  shifts in our product or services mix  changes in our operating expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and 
table of contents operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  any of which could cause a significant adverse change in the trading price of our common stock 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to sell new products on a timely basis 
we believe that our ability to sell  deploy and service new  innovative products with features that respond to our customers changing demands and that incorporate new technological standards will be critical to our future success 
we are dependent upon our ability to contract with manufacturers to sell their existing products  as well as new product introductions that address customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure by us to update our product offerings  train our staff to support and service such products or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could harm our business materially 
our solutions are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly  and time consuming to repair 
undetected software or hardware errors frequently occur in networking products when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
our solutions are complex and are a combination of products from the third party manufacturers whose products we represent and sell  and from time to time there may be errors in these products 
these errors could adversely affect our sales  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
all domestic employment at mti  including employment of our domestic key personnel  is at will 
both mti us and its us employees have the right to terminate employment at any time  with or without advance notice  and with or without cause 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our salespeople  technical staff and senior management team  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of the services of our key personnel  especially to our competitors  could materially harm our business 
the failure to retain key personnel  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our key personnel  could materially harm our business 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales and services 
international sales and services represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
international sales and service revenue represented of our total sales and service revenue for fiscal year if we are unable to maintain international market demand for our products and services  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  import or export restrictions  
table of contents greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  and differing customer and or technology standards requirements 
all of our sales and services in international markets are priced in the applicable local currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
such contracts can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
war and terrorist activities could adversely affect our business 
the continued threat of terrorism within the us and europe and acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether war and the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may have difficulty managing any future growth effectively 
we believe our emc relationship positions us to grow in the mid range storage market because emc is the leading disk subsystem vendor and both companies are pure play storage providers  accustomed to selling and servicing similar customer bases  supporting mission critical environments  providing fully integrated value added solutions and offering xx support on those installations 
our facilities  personnel and operating and financial systems may not be sufficient to effectively manage our future growth and  as a result  we may lose our ability to respond to new opportunities promptly 
additionally  our expected revenue growth may not materialize and increases in our operating expenses in response to the expected revenue growth may harm our operating results and financial condition 
our future growth is dependent upon many factors  including but not limited to  recruiting  hiring  training and retaining significant numbers of qualified personnel  forecasting revenues  controlling expenses and managing assets 
in particular  significant growth will require that we train  integrate and retain qualified sales personnel in various geographic regions 
as we are in a highly competitive growth market  the loss of a significant number of such persons  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as a reseller of third party products  we are susceptible to factors that may affect their future results of operations 
a majority of our future sales are sales of third party products 
as such  we are open to the risk factors affecting our vendors results of operations including  but not limited to that their business could be adversely affected by the general economic conditions and or decreasing demand in the information technology market  their failure to keep pace with the rapid industry and technological changes  their failure to be competitive in terms of product pricing  that their research and development efforts may not be successful  
table of contents their inability to compete effectively or meet future capital requirements  that their suppliers may not be able to meet their requirements  their difficulty in managing their operation or any future growth  their inability to retain or attract key personnel  financial difficulty they may experience  that their business could be adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions  investments  alliances  litigation and changes in regulations  and that their business may suffer if they cannot protect their intellectual property 
we may face inherent costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that the products we sell infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
though the majority of our future product sales will be third party products  and the applicable third party manufacturers will defend their own intellectual property rights  in the event such claims are made against our suppliers  we may be faced with a situation in which we cannot sell the products and thus our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
in addition  in the future  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our own intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses  or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of the complaint  likely would be time consuming  costly  and a distraction to our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
if we and or our partners are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may be unable either to sell our solutions or to be competitive in the marketplace 
our solutions must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the us and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we sell in the future also must meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our solutions integrate san  nas  das and cas technologies into single storage architecture 
components of these architectures must comply with evolving industry standards 
we also depend upon our supporters that provide us with products to sell to meet these standards 
if our suppliers or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a single stockholder  and other stockholders may not be able to influence corporate decisions 
ralph j 
yarro iii  one of our directors  is also the director and president and chief executive officer of canopy which beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
canopy is able to substantially affect our actions which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the company and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without canopy s support 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of an investment in our company could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock variations between our actual and anticipated earnings  the timing and announcement of new products or services by us  our partners or by our competitors  services or technological innovations by us  our partners or by our competitors  failure of our results from operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or our competitive position  the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions broadly and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
in addition  stock markets  particularly the nasdaq smallcap market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of securities of companies such as ours have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
fluctuations such as these may affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management s attention and resources 
we may fail to comply with nasdaq marketplace rules 
our securities have been trading on the nasdaq smallcap market since august  we are currently in compliance with nasdaq smallcap market continued listing requirements 
however  we failed to comply with nasdaq marketplace rules particularly with the minimum bid price requirement in fiscal year  and may once again fail to comply with the minimum bid price requirement  or other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if that happens and we do not regain compliance by the end of the applicable grace period to regain compliance  our stock will be delisted and we would likely seek listing of our common stock on the over the counter market  which is viewed by many investors as a less liquid marketplace 
as a result  the price per share of our common stock would likely decrease materially and  the trading market for our common stock  our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to secure additional financing would likely be materially and adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions  provisions for staggered terms of office of the board of directors  and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
also  the rights of holders of our common stock may be affected adversely by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
in the prior year  in order to minimize the risk of foreign exchange loss  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
however  in order to conserve cash  we ended our hedging program in fiscal year 
table of contents our exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations is limited to our short term borrowings under our line of credit 
our line of credit allows borrowings up to million and therefore a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by million if the line of credit were fully utilized
