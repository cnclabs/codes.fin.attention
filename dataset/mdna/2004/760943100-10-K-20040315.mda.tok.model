our business we receive revenues primarily from the delivery of residential  training  educational and support services to various populations with special needs 
we have three reportable operating segments i disabilities services  ii youth services and iii training services 
management s discussion and analysis of each segment is included below 
further information regarding each of these segments  including the disclosure of required segment financial information  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues for our disabilities services operations are derived primarily from state medicaid programs and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state government agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid program 
we also provide respite  therapeutic and other services on an as needed basis or hourly basis through our periodic in home services programs that are reimbursed on a unit of service basis 
reimbursement varies by state and service type  and may be based on a variety of methods including flat rate  cost based reimbursement  per person per diem  or unit of service 
generally  rates are adjusted annually based upon historical costs experienced by us and by other service providers  or economic conditions and their impact on state budgets 
at facilities and programs where we are the provider of record  we are directly reimbursed under state medicaid programs for services we provide and such revenues are affected by occupancy levels 
at most facilities and programs that we operate pursuant to management contracts  the management fee is negotiated with the provider of record 

table of contents we operate programs for at risk and troubled youths through our ays and youthtrack subsidiaries 
most of the youth services programs are funded directly by federal  state and local government agencies including school systems 
under these contracts  we are typically reimbursed based on fixed contract amounts  flat rates or cost based rates 
we operate vocational training centers under the federal job corps program administered by the dol 
under job corps contracts  we are reimbursed for direct facility and program costs related to job corps center operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee 
the management fee can take the form of a fixed contractual amount or be computed based on certain performance criteria 
all of such amounts are reflected as revenue  and all such direct costs are reflected as facility and program costs 
final determination of amounts due under job corps contracts is subject to audit and review by the dol  and renewals and extension of job corps contracts are based in part on performance reviews 
in january  we purchased the assets of arbor e t 
arbor e t operates job training and placement programs that assist disadvantaged job seekers in finding employment and improving their career prospects 
funded through approximately performance based or fixed fee contracts from local and state governments  arbor e t employs more than staff  including counselors  trainers  career advisors  and job developers 
based in media  pennsylvania  arbor e t operates career centers in california  georgia  new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  virginia  washington and west virginia 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and application of our critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicaid programs  other government agencies and commercial insurance companies 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including historical loss rates  age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors  general economic conditions and the status of state budgets 
complex rules and regulations regarding billing and timely filing requirements in various states are also a factor in our assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change of estimate 
reserves for insurance risks we self insure a substantial portion of our professional and general liability  workers compensation and health benefit risks 
provisions for losses for these risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates 
the allowances for these risks include an amount determined from reported claims and an amount based on past experiences for losses incurred but not reported 
estimates of workers compensation claims reserves are discounted using a discount rate of and at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the discount rate between years is attributable to the overall decrease in treasury rates 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by million 
these liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and  while we believe that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be more or less than the amounts recorded 
the liabilities are reviewed quarterly and any adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period known 
legal contingencies we are party to numerous claims and lawsuits with respect to various matters 
the material legal proceedings in which rescare is currently involved are described in item of this report and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we provide for costs related to contingencies when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably determinable 
we confer with outside counsel in estimating our potential liability for certain legal contingencies 
while we believe our provision for legal contingencies is adequate  the outcome of legal proceedings is difficult to predict and we may settle legal claims or be subject to judgments for amounts that exceed our estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  loss of contracts  significant census declines  reductions in reimbursement levels and significant litigation 
our evaluation is based on cash flow  profitability and projections that incorporate current or projected operating results  as well as significant events or changes in the environment 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value based upon various techniques to estimate fair value 

table of contents goodwill with respect to businesses we have acquired  we evaluate the costs of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired goodwill for impairment at least annually  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
we are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis 
a reporting unit is the operating segment unless  for businesses within that operating segment  discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management  in which case such a component business is the reporting unit 
we use a fair value approach to test goodwill for impairment and recognize an impairment charge for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implicit fair value 
fair values are established using a weighted average of discounted cash flows and comparative market multiples in the current market conditions 
discounted cash flow computations depend on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
the discount rate used as of december  and was and  respectively 
a variance in the discount rate could have a significant impact on the impairment analysis 
for example  a increase in the discount rate would decrease the fair value of the reporting unit by million  million and million for the disabilities  youth and training services reporting units  respectively  whereas a decrease in the discount rate would increase the fair value by million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our reporting units 
revenue recognition disabilities services 
revenues are derived primarily from state medicaid programs and from management contracts with private operators  generally not for profit providers  who contract with state agencies and are also reimbursed under the medicaid programs 
revenues are recorded at rates established at or before the time services are rendered 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
youth services 
juvenile treatment revenues are derived primarily from contracts with state agencies under various reimbursement systems 
reimbursement from state or locally awarded contracts varies per facility or program  and is typically paid under fixed contract amounts  flat rates  or cost based rates 
revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered 
training services 
revenues include amounts reimbursable under cost reimbursement contracts with the dol for operating job corps centers and with local and state governments for arbor e t 
the contracts provide reimbursement for all facility and program costs related to operations  allowable indirect costs for general and administrative costs  plus a predetermined management fee  normally a fixed percentage of facility and program costs 
for certain of our current contracts and any contract renewals  the management fee is a combination of fixed and performance based 
final determination of amounts due under the contracts is subject to audit and review by the applicable government agencies 
revenue is recognized in the period associated costs are incurred 
laws and regulations governing the government programs and contracts are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
for each operating segment  expenses are subject to examination by agencies administering the contracts and services 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for potential adjustments arising from such examinations 

table of contents recent developments on march   we announced that onex partners lp has agreed to purchase million of newly issued convertible preferred stock 
we plan to use the proceeds to fund future growth opportunities 
the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of  subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals  as may be determined 
in a related transaction  onex partners also agreed to purchase million common shares from our company s founder  james r

year in review despite challenging budgetary issues at the state level  during we improved services  profitability and our balance sheet  and also added new homes 
we continued to manage costs and exercise fiscal discipline 
revenues for the year were million and net income was million  or per diluted share 
these items are discussed in more detail in the following sections of the md a 
the following highlights some of the events of the past year that reflect our progress on december   we completed an agreement for a million senior secured credit facility and the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due december this senior credit facility replaces the previously held million credit facility 
the new credit facility includes a million revolver and a million term loan and is due in january the revolver has a million sub limit for letters of credit 
the new credit facility is subject to certain covenants including maintaining certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as discussed above  in december  we formally issued the notice to call the convertible subordinated notes  all of which were redeemed by the trustee on january  we funded the redemption and were relieved as primary obligor on december   with million from the term loan  and the remainder from cash on hand 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million  or per share  in the fourth quarter of related to the refinancing of the credit facility and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes  including the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  premiums paid to noteholders for early redemption  and costs of a related consent solicitation 
our operational performance continues to be enhanced by the acquisition of arbor e t  which we completed in the first quarter 
this business generated approximately million in revenues in the new homes added during generated revenues for of approximately million 
the new homes opened in added approximately million of revenue in training services was awarded a million contract by the us department of labor to continue operating the pittsburgh job corps center in pittsburgh  pennsylvania

these tuck in acquisitions represent approximately million in annualized revenues 
union employees in ohio and west virginia voted to ratify a three year contract with our company  ending more than two years of working without a contract 
we believe the contract terms are fair for employees and for our company

the million accounts receivable write off in the fourth quarter of eliminates substantially all trade receivables with dates of service and before 
we wrote off the amounts after consideration of the deterioration in various states budgets and the resulting impact on opportunities for collection 
the non core operation charge relates to costs associated with an investigation and closure of certain units of a non core operation which provides skills training to persons with severe mental illness in texas 
the mental health operation was managed by its founders under a management contract and represents less than of the total revenues of the disabilities services division 
during  we completed transactions to redeem million of the convertible subordinated notes resulting in gains on extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional reserve for losses on accounts receivable of million as a result of information obtained during the implementation of the new accounts receivable information system

table of contents consolidated consolidated revenues for increased over  attributable primarily to the acquisition of arbor e t  the new homes added in  full year impact of the new homes added in  and the continued growth in our periodic in home services offset by overall rate decreases of approximately and the loss of the clements job corps contract 
revenues grew in over resulting primarily from the growth in our periodic in home services and homes opened during operating income increased to million in from million in due primarily to million of charges taken in as previously described and as a result of the arbor e t acquisition which added approximately million of operating income 
similarly  operating income increased to million in from million in due primarily to charges that were present in but not in additionally  operating income was impacted by million of goodwill amortization which was not present in lastly  our operating results for as compared to reflect the cost pressures from a competitive labor market in certain regions 
we had several initiatives to manage these labor cost pressures  including enhanced recruitment and retention programs in order to reduce the need for overtime and temporary staffing  evaluating and monitoring staff patterns and negotiating improved reimbursement rates from certain states 
additionally  we substantially completed deployment of an automated time and attendance management system which enabled us to more efficiently staff our facilities and monitor staffing  resulting in reduced overtime and temporary staffing 
labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to due to the effect of wage pass throughs and growth in periodic in home services 
as a percentage of total revenues  corporate general and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent at in  in and in due to continued cost containment measures including restrictions on non essential expenses 
depreciation and amortization decreased significantly in and compared to primarily as we no longer amortize goodwill 
goodwill amortization was million in interest expense decreased million in compared to an increase of million in the increase in compared to is due principally to a full year of interest on the senior notes issued in november our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates in and approximated the statutory rate considering the impact of state taxes and the benefit of jobs credits

disabilities services disabilities services revenues increased in over compared to a increase in over revenues increased in from the addition of new homes added throughout  the new homes added throughout and growth in our periodic in home services 
revenues increased in over due primarily to the addition of new homes and periodic in home services growth 
operating margin for this division increased from in to in  due primarily to the effect of the write off of doubtful accounts receivable of million applicable to this division in youth services youth services revenues decreased in over and in over  resulting primarily from reduced revenues at certain youthtrack operations 
operating margin for this division increased to in from in and from in  due in part to the workers compensation charge of million applicable to this division in  as well as the closure of under performing programs during and before these specified items  operating margin was in  in and in improved management and the closure of under performing programs during and resulted in increased margins before specified items 
we believe the reductions reflect the funding priorities of these states in response to budgetary pressures 

table of contents training services training services revenues increased in over and in over the primary source of the increase is the addition of arbor e t and the tulsa job corps contract which contributed approximately million and million  respectively  in revenues in this increase was partially offset by the loss of the clements job corps contract which contributed incremental revenue in of approximately million 
operating margin for this division was compared to relatively stable margins of in and in again  the primary driver of the increase was arbor e t 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources total assets decreased in as compared to primarily due to the use of cash on hand of approximately million for the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes 
this was somewhat offset by increases in accounts receivable due to the growth in revenues and additions to goodwill related to the arbor e t purchase 
during the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million for and million for the increase in from was due primarily to tax refunds of million  higher profitability and strong cash collections 
the increase in from was related primarily to higher profitability  less tax expenditures  and improved cash collections 
days revenue in net accounts receivable were days at december   compared to days at december  and days at december  net accounts receivable at december  increased to million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in over relates to the overall increase in revenues including the addition of arbor e t 
the improvement in over reflects the fourth quarter write off of million recorded in and improved collections 
of the total net accounts receivable balance at december  and  approximately and  respectively  were greater than days 
during the years ended december  and  cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively  primarily for purchases of property and equipment  while in  cash provided by investing activities was million 
cash provided by investing activities in resulted primarily from the sale and leaseback of certain of our owned properties with cash proceeds of million 
proceeds from these activities were used primarily to pay down amounts owed under our previous credit facility 
maintenance capital expenditures remained relatively constant at approximately of total revenues 
financing activities for resulted in the use of cash of million  primarily related to the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes offset by the draw down of million from the term loan 
financing activities for resulted in the use of cash amounting to million  primarily related to the redemption of debt during the year 
financing activities used cash of million in reflecting pay downs of the credit facility from the sale leaseback proceeds 
our capital requirements relate primarily to the working capital needed for general corporate purposes and our plans to expand through the development of new facilities and programs 
we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements  capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments from our operating cash flow and utilization of our credit facility 

table of contents on december   we completed an agreement for a million senior credit facility and the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes due december this senior credit facility replaces the previously held million credit facility with national city bank ncb facility and matures in january bank one capital markets led the syndication for the senior credit facility  which includes a million revolver and a million term loan 
the revolver includes a million sub limit for letters of credit 
in december  we formally issued the notice to call the convertible subordinated notes  which were redeemed by the trustee on january  we funded the redemption and were relieved as primary obligor on december   with million from the term loan and the remainder from cash on hand 
the balance of the term loan facility is undrawn 
as of december   we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the principal amount of million issued primarily in connection with our insurance programs 
as of december   we had million available under the revolver as our borrowing base under the revolver was million on that date 
our borrowing base is a function of our accounts receivable balance as of the reporting date 
the facility contains various financial covenants relating to net worth  capital expenditures and rentals and requires us to maintain specified ratios with respect to fixed charge coverage and leverage 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  our ability to achieve the thresholds provided for in the financial covenants largely depends upon the maintenance of continued profitability and or reductions of amounts borrowed under the facility  and continued cash collections 
as of december  and  included in our cash and cash equivalents balance is million and million  respectively  of cash held on deposit with an insurance carrier as collateral for our insurance program 
in accordance with our collateral arrangement with the insurance carrier  such deposit may at our discretion be exchanged for a letter of credit 
we believe sources of funds described above  in addition to cash generated from operations and amounts remaining available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  planned capital expenditure and scheduled debt repayment requirements for the next twelve months

table of contents in accordance with the definition under securities and exchange commission rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
the company owns equity and voting interest in one of alutiiq llc s alutiiq subsidiaries  alutiiq professional services  llc aps 
since the purchase of the minority interest of aps in  we have treated the entity as an equity investment  recognizing of the entity s earnings as additional revenue less than million for all years presented 
conversely  alutiiq continues to consolidate aps and recognize an offsetting minority interest for our portion of aps s earnings 
management evaluated aps in light of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as restated in december  and concluded that although aps is considered a variable interest entity  alutiiq is the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  we continue to record interest in aps s net income or loss 
there were no other significant off balance sheet transactions or interests 
impact of recently issued accounting standards see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain risk factors we derive virtually all of our revenues from federal  state and local government agencies  including state medicaid programs 
our revenues therefore are determined by the size of the governmental appropriations for the services we provide 
budgetary pressures  as well as economic  industry  political and other factors  could influence governments not to increase and possibly to decrease appropriations for these services which could reduce our margins materially 
future federal or state initiatives could institute managed care programs for persons we serve or otherwise make material changes to the medicaid program as it now exists 
federal  state and local government agencies generally condition their contracts with us upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation 
if a government agency does not receive an appropriation sufficient to cover their contractual obligations with us  they may terminate a contract or defer or reduce our reimbursement 
additionally  there is risk that previously appropriated funds could be reduced through subsequent legislation 
the loss of  or reduction of  reimbursement under our contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
this is mitigated by the fact that we operate in states 
for the year ended  we experienced an aggregate rate decrease for our disabilities services division of approximately 
our historical growth in revenues has been directly related to increases in the number of individuals served in each of our operating segments 
this growth has depended largely upon development driven activities  including the acquisitions of other businesses or facilities  the acquisition of management contract rights to operate facilities  the award of contracts to open new facilities or start new operations or to assume management of facilities previously operated by governmental agencies or other organizations  and the extension or renewal of contracts previously awarded to us 
our future revenues will depend primarily upon our ability to maintain  expand and renew existing service contracts and existing leases  and to a lesser extent upon our ability to obtain additional contracts to provide services to the special needs populations we serve  whether through awards in response to requests for proposals for new programs  in connection with facilities being privatized by governmental agencies  or by selected acquisitions 
our job corps contracts are re bid  regardless of operating performance  
table of contents every five years 
we may not be successful in bidding for contracts to operate  or to continue operating  job corps centers 
changes in the market for services and contracts  including increasing competition  transition costs or costs to implement awarded contracts  could adversely affect the timing and or viability of future development activities 
additionally  many of our contracts are subject to state or federal government procurement rules and procedures  changes in procurement policies that may be adopted by one or more of these agencies could also adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain these contracts 
our revenues and operating profitability depend on our ability to maintain our existing reimbursement levels  to obtain periodic increases in reimbursement rates to meet higher costs and demand for more services  and to receive timely payment from applicable government agencies 
if we do not receive or cannot negotiate increases in reimbursement rates at approximately the same time as our costs of providing services increase  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
changes in how federal and state government agencies operate reimbursement programs can also affect our operating results and financial condition 
government reimbursement  group home credentialing and mr dd client medicaid eligibility and service authorization procedures are often complicated and burdensome  and delays can result from  among other reasons  securing documentation timely and coordinating necessary eligibility paperwork between agencies 
these reimbursement and procedural issues occasionally cause us to have to resubmit claims several times before payment is remitted and are primarily responsible for our aged receivables 
changes in the manner in which state agencies interpret program policies and procedures  and review and audit billings and costs could also affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and our ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness 
our cost structure and ultimate operating profitability are directly related to our labor costs 
labor costs may be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including limited availability of qualified personnel in each geographic area  local competitive forces  the ineffective utilization of our labor force  changes in minimum wages or other direct personnel costs  strikes or work stoppages by employees represented by labor unions  and changes in client services models  such as the trends toward supported living and managed care 
the difficulty experienced in hiring direct service staff and nursing staff in certain markets from time to time has resulted in higher labor costs in some of our operating units 
these higher labor costs are associated with increased overtime  recruitment and retention  training programs  and use of temporary staffing personnel and outside clinical consultants 
additionally  the maintenance and expansion of our operations depend on the continuation of trends toward downsizing  privatization and consolidation and our ability to tailor our services to meet the specific needs of the populations we serve 
our success in a changing operational environment is subject to a variety of political  economic  social and legal pressures 
such pressures include a desire of governmental agencies to reduce costs and increase levels of services  federal  state and local budgetary constraints  and actions brought by advocacy groups and the courts to change existing service delivery systems 
material changes resulting from these trends and pressures could adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement of our services and our operating flexibility  and ultimately our revenues and profitability 
media coverage of the industry  including operators of facilities and programs for persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities  has from time to time included reports critical of the current trend toward privatization and of the operation of certain of these facilities and programs 
adverse media coverage about providers of these services in general and us  in particular  could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny in some areas  and could adversely affect our revenues and profitability by  among other things  adversely affecting our ability to obtain or retain contracts  discouraging government agencies from privatizing facilities and programs  increasing regulation and resulting compliance costs  or discouraging clients from using our services 
in recent years  changes in the market for insurance  particularly for professional and general liability coverage  have made it more difficult to obtain insurance coverage at reasonable rates 
as a result  our insurance program costs for continued to increase 
our self insured retentions have also increased 
the professional and general liability coverage provides for a  deductible per occurrence  and claims limits of million per occurrence up to a million annual aggregate limit 
our workers compensation coverage provides for a million deductible per occurrence  and claims up to statutory limits 
we utilize historical data to estimate our reserves for our insurance programs 
if losses on asserted claims exceed the current insurance coverage and accrued reserves  our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to meet obligations under our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

table of contents the collection of accounts receivable is a significant management challenge and requires continual focus 
prior to  many of our accounts receivable controls were managed through manual procedures 
we have expended significant effort and resources to implement a new accounts receivable system which was substantially in place at the end of the limitations of some state information systems and procedures  such as the inability to receive documentation or disperse funds electronically  may limit the benefits we derive from our new system 
we must maintain or continue to improve our controls and procedures for managing our accounts receivable billing and collection activities if we are to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis 
an inability to do so could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
our financial results depend on timely billing of payor agencies  effectively managing collections  and efficiently utilizing our personnel to manage labor costs 
we have completed the new accounts receivable system and interactive automated time and attendance management system that have improved our management of these functions resulting in improved collections and reductions in operating expenses 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and maintain compliance with various financial covenants contained in our debt arrangements will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt obligations and maintain covenant compliance  we may have to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we can provide no assurance that any refinancing including the commitment described in liquidity and capital resources above would be possible  that any assets could be sold  or  if sold  of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales  or that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  maintain covenant compliance or refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness 
we must comply with comprehensive government regulation of our business  including statutes  regulations and policies governing the licensing of our facilities  the quality of our service  the revenues we receive for our services  and reimbursement for the cost of our services
