chromcraft revington encounters intense domestic and import competition in the sale of all its products 
furniture imports into the us continue to grow at double digit rates with the majority of the growth coming from china 
foreign importers compete based on price  utilizing their low wage and overhead cost structure 
in addition  china s government continues to hold its currency value fixed to the us dollar  which has helped to keep its goods cheaper  thereby increasing its exports 
low cost imports and the global oversupply of furniture capacity have begun to cause deflationary pricing pressures in the us market 
these competitive conditions are expected to continue 
significant factors that influence furniture sales include consumer confidence levels  interest rates  consumer spending and new and existing home sales 
chromcraft revington s business strategy is to operate as a low cost  high quality manufacturer and distributor of residential and commercial furniture 
in response to the reduced sales level  the company has adjusted production schedules to lower inventories  implemented cost reduction programs and reduced employment levels 
also  the company has supplemented its domestic manufacturing with imports of low cost  labor intensive furniture components and finished furniture from the far east 
using this blended approach of domestic manufacturing and selective importing  the company believes it is better able to control the quality of furniture and service to its customers

the company is seeking ways to mitigate this impact through product engineering  offshore sourcing of low cost inventory components and material substitution 
due to the competitive environment  the company does not expect to be able to pass through any significant cost increases to its customers in the near future
