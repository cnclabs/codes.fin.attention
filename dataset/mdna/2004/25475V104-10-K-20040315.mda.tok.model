item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with distributed energy s financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement prospectus 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  potential  should  will  and would or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss distributed energy s future expectations and contain projections of its future results of operation or of its financial position or state other forward looking information 
however  there may be events in the future that distributed energy is unable to predict accurately or control 
the factors in the section entitled risk factors and the section below entitled critical accounting judgments and estimates provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause distributed energy s actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in distributed energy s forward looking statements 
overview formed in may  distributed energy systems corp 
is creating and delivering innovative products and solutions to the energy marketplace  giving users greater control over their energy cost  quality  and reliability 
distributed energy was formed as the parent company of two established businesses proton energy systems  inc proton and northern power systems  inc northern 
distributed energy believes the acquisition of northern s project integration experience will strengthen proton s near term capabilities  accelerate entry into early energy related markets and contribute to advancing proton s vision of producing hydrogen from renewable sources 
proton was founded in to design  develop and manufacture pem electrochemical products for commercial applications 
proton s proprietary pem technology is incorporated in two families of products hydrogen generators  which proton is currently manufacturing and delivery commercial models to customers  and regenerative fuel cell systems  which proton is currently developing 
northern was incorporated in delaware in december to design  manufacture and install reliable  cost efficient distributed generation power systems using fossil fuel  solar energy and wind energy 
northern was originally founded in under the name of north wind power company 
northern also develops  manufactures and installs utility grade wind turbines 
northern sells its products to domestic and international customers 
distributed energy expects to incur additional operating losses in and cannot predict when it will become profitable  if ever 
the following significant events occurred in we successfully completed the acquisition of northern on december  we strengthened proton s intellectual property position by bringing our total us and foreign patent filings to proton holds issued us patents and three issued european patents 
we successfully completed the consolidation of proton s operations by relocating the remainder of our research and development and manufacturing functions to our new facility in wallingford  connecticut 
we made a cash distribution of per share payable on june  to shareholders of record as of june  in the future no additional cash distributions are planned 
we reached agreement to end our development  marketing and distribution agreement for small laboratory hydrogen generators with matheson tri gas 
proton was featured at a white house sponsored event to promote president bush s billion freedom car and fuel initiative 

table of contents we received a contract to develop a kw regenerative solar proton exchange membrane fuel cell demonstration system from jacobs sverdrup technology  inc  a subcontractor to the us navy  for testing at the naval air weapons station at china lake  california 
we received authorization to begin phase ii of our contract with the naval research laboratory  as funded by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa  for advanced fuel cell technology development 
we substantially completed our field retrofit of hogen series cell stacks that we determined were in need of replacement and resumed production and shipment of our hogen hydrogen generators 
we received a contract award from the university of nevada las vegas research foundation for the delivery of a solar powered hydrogen system 
we achieved new benchmarks in quality and reliability for our cell stack components  accumulating two million hours of operation in commercial service  with  hours between unscheduled shutdowns in membrane electrode assemblies mea s used in cell stacks achieved very high levels of process quality and consistency with percent being defect free 
we successfully completed the first external audit by tuv rhineland of our quality management system under the rigorous iso standard 
we launched our hogen h series hydrogen generators which produce ultra pure hydrogen at an output capacity of standard cubic feet per hour at a fraction of the cost of cylinder or tube trailer gas and designed to meet the demands of high volume customers in the power generation  semiconductor  electronics  and heat treating fields 
subsequent events in february  proton announced the departure of dr 
larry sweet  the president of proton  to pursue other professional interests 
critical accounting judgments and estimates distributed energy s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by distributed energy in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires distributed energy to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
distributed energy s estimates include those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  depreciable lives of equipment  warranty obligations and contingency accruals 
distributed energy bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of distributed energy s accounting policies  see note to distributed energy s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the audit committee of distributed energy s board of directors has discussed distributed energy s critical accounting policies with management and distributed energy s independent accountants 
distributed energy s critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition product revenue the proton subsidiary began delivering late stage development models of its hydrogen generators to customers in  revenue on such transactions had generally been deferred until the expiration of the product warranty period due to the newness of the product and the absence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous 
table of contents transactions to make a reasonable estimate of future warranty expenses 
in the fourth quarter of  proton determined that it had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to sales of hogen units upon shipment 
as a result  proton recognized previously deferred hogen series revenue of  in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of  proton discovered performance issues relating to the operation of cell stacks and associated sensors in its hogen series units 
proton s investigation of these issues revealed the presence of previously unknown pinholes in cell membranes in the field that resulted in hydrogen leakage and cell failure 
as a result  proton determined that recognizing revenue on shipment of its hogen series units was no longer appropriate because of significant uncertainty surrounding the reliability of the existing design of the pem electrolyzer cell stack within its hogen series generators 
proton has made modifications to the existing cell stack design to improve its performance and anticipates deferring product revenue until it has compiled sufficient warranty history on units containing modified cell stacks 
for this reason  product revenue from hogen series shipments is being deferred until the expiration of the product warranty period typically  one year 
as of december   proton has deferred revenue of approximately million related to hydrogen generators it has delivered 
in the future  proton expects to derive the majority of its revenue from the sale of the hydrogen generators and regenerative fuel cell systems products that it may develop 
in the fourth quarter of  proton determined that it had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to sales of laboratory units upon shipment 
as a result  proton recognized previously deferred revenue associated with its laboratory generators of  in the fourth quarter of proton will continue to defer revenue on shipments of its hogen and its h series hydrogen products until such units are past the product warranty period or until proton has adequate warranty history 
if proton determines that it has sufficient data available to reasonably estimate the warranty cost associated with a product  proton will begin recognizing product revenue and the related costs of production with respect to that product upon delivery 
this could materially increase the amount of product revenue and costs of production in proton s reported results 
revenue recognition contract revenue contract costs may be incurred over a period of several months to several years  and the estimation of these costs requires management s judgment 
the long term nature and complexity of these contracts can affect the company s ability to estimate costs precisely 
as a result  the company reviews and updates its costs estimates on a quarterly basis or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate 
losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined 
warranty costs should the company experience actual repair costs that are higher than the estimated repair costs used to calculate the provision  the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such additional costs materialize will be adversely impacted 
inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
this policy requires distributed energy to write down its inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value to reflect assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions become less favorable than anticipated or if our ability to realize value on our inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the company has adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable to business combinations completed after june  these standards require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  set forth the accounting for the initial recognition of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  and describe the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to initial recognition 
under the provisions of these standards  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing and will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
this testing compares carrying values to fair values and if the carrying value of these assets is less than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized for the amount of the difference 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock based compensation plans  including employee stock option plans 
as allowed by sfas no 
 distributed energy has elected to continue to account for stock based compensation issued to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb  compensation expense is computed to the extent that the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the employee stock option or stock award 
compensation so computed is then recognized over the vesting period 
the company accounts for stock based compensation issued to non employees in accordance with sfas and the consensus in emerging issues task force eitf these pronouncements require the fair value of equity instruments given as consideration for services rendered be recognized as a non cash charge to income over the shorter of the vesting or service period 
the equity instruments must be revalued on each subsequent reporting date until performance is complete with a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized for any changes in their fair value 
in the event that we are required to record compensation expense that is currently only being disclosed under sfas  an adjustment to decrease net income in such period would result 
the following table highlights the impact that each of the various assumptions has on determining the fair value of an option or award when using an option pricing model impact of inputs to value of equity instrument volatility of stock higher the volatility higher the value expected term longer the term higher the value risk free rate higher the rate higher the value dividend yield lower the yield higher the value exercise price lower the exercise price a higher the value stock price fair value higher the stock price higher the value a presumes exercise is less than fair value 
table of contents results of operations the results of operations for include the full year of proton s operations and the period from december  through december  for northern and distributed energy 
comparison of the years and contract revenue 
contract revenue decreased from million for to million for the amount in includes million related to northern s distributed generation power systems 
the decrease was due to the cessation of research and development activity under the naval research laboratory nrl contract  which was substantially completed in december in the future  distributed energy expects to generate contract revenue from projects in northern s three commercial business units remote infrastructure  on site generation  and renewable energy and through proton s government sponsored research and development contracts 
with the acquisition of northern the company expects contract revenue to increase significantly in the future 
product revenue 
product revenue decreased from million in to million for the comparable period in in the fourth quarter of  laboratory hydrogen generator revenues began to be recognized upon shipment 
the revenue in accordingly  represents laboratory hydrogen generator revenue recognized upon expiration of the warranty period of  previously deferred laboratory hydrogen generator revenue recognized within the warranty period of  fourth quarter laboratory hydrogen generator revenue of  and spare parts sales and other revenue of  included in product revenue is hogen product revenue of  laboratory hydrogen generator revenue of  and spare part sales and other revenue of  hydrogen generator units shipped 
total units shipped excluding shipments under the stm contract decreased from in to in shipments of the hogen series units increased from in to in total revenue deferred in related to these units shipped was approximately million 
shipments of our laboratory hydrogen generator series units decreased from units in to units in during the company was in the process of replacing hogen series cell stacks in accordance with its cell stack replacement program described below and in note of the financial statements 
for this reason  production and selling efforts with respect to the hogen series units were curtailed 
the decrease in laboratory hydrogen generator units is attributable to the company s terminated agreement with matheson tri gas  inc in january  under which the company agreed not to sell or market the units before june in the fourth quarter of  we discovered performance issues relating to the operation of cell stacks and associated sensors in our hogen series units 
our investigation revealed the presence of previously unknown pinholes in cell membranes in the field that resulted in hydrogen leakage and cell failure 
as a result  we determined that recognizing revenue on shipment of our hogen series units was no longer appropriate because of significant uncertainty surrounding the reliability of the existing design of the pem electrolyzer cell stack within our hogen series generators 
we have made modifications to the existing cell stack design to improve its performance and anticipate deferring product revenue until we have compiled sufficient warranty history on units containing modified cell stacks 
for this reason  product revenue from hogen series shipments made subsequent to september  is deferred until the expiration of the product warranty period 
costs of contract revenue 
costs of contract revenue increased from million for to million for the amount for includes million related to northern s distributed generation power systems contracts for the period december  to december  costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue increased from in to in the increase in costs of contract revenue  and increase in costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue  in was due primarily to the mix of 
table of contents contracts during those time periods  and specifically to the cessation of proton s research and development activity under the nrl contract which was substantially completed in december proton s contracts are generally cost share arrangements  under which proton is reimbursed only for an agreed portion of its costs incurred to perform under the contract 
the nrl contract is a cost plus fixed fee contract  under which proton is reimbursed for allowable incurred costs plus a fixed fee 
in general  proton is reimbursed for a greater percentage of its costs incurred under a cost plus fixed fee contract than under a cost share arrangement 
with the acquisition of northern the company expects its costs of contract revenue to increase significantly in the future 
costs of production 
costs of production decreased from million for to million for costs of production as a percentage of product revenue decreased from in to in the amounts in and reflect costs associated with manufacturing and delivering proton s hydrogen generators as well as warranty costs on units in the field 
the decrease in costs of production in  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of product revenue  was primarily due to million in costs incurred in to address performance problems relating to the operation of cell stacks and associated sensors in the hogen series units  and much of our production efforts during the first two quarters of were remedying the problems in our hogen products referred to previously 
in  costs of production includes approximately  of previously deferred cost recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue associated with our laboratory hydrogen generators 
we expect costs of production to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future as we continue to refine our processes and reduce our material costs  however  costs of production could increase if warranty experience deteriorates 
in january  the exclusive distribution agreement with matheson tri gas  inc  was jointly terminated by agreement with matheson tri gas 
under the terms of the settlement agreement proton agreed to continue to support units under warranty  provide spare parts for five years  sell an additional laboratory hydrogen generators to matheson tri gas  and not sell or market laboratory hydrogen generators before june  to date  under its agreement with matheson tri gas  inc  proton has recognized costs in excess of its contracted sales price in the amount of  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million for to million for the decrease was due to a decrease in proton s research and development activities related to its pem technology in regenerative fuel cell systems and hydrogen generators 
these research and development activities primarily related to salaries and benefits for research and development staff and materials to support research and development projects 
specifically  the company increased development efforts in the hogen h series area by million  offset by decreases in the following areas backup power million  hogen series million  refueler million  laboratory generators million  and renewables combustion million 
in addition  in the company recorded an offset to expenses of  related to proton s agreement with the connecticut clean energy fund 
in  we expect research and development expense to significantly decrease 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for to million for the million increase in is attributable to the following million of expenses related to northern from december  to december   million for a stock compensation charge related to distributed energy options issued to northern employees on the merger date  million increase in salaries and benefits  million increase in professional fees primarily related to the northern transaction  million increase in facility related expenses  and a million increase in selling expenses 
interest income 
interest income decreased from million for to million for the decrease resulted from lower cash and marketable securities balances as well as lower average interest rates 
the average cash and marketable securities balances for and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the decreased cash and marketable securities balances were largely due to the cash distribution in june the average interest rates for and were approximately and  respectively 

table of contents interest expense 
distributed energy recorded interest expense of  for  compared to  for the increase in interest expense in relates to a full year of debt service associated with distributed energy s wallingford facility loan 
construction was completed in comparison of years and contract revenue 
contract revenue increased from million in to million in this increase was due primarily to research and development activity under the nrl contract entered into in the fourth quarter of revenue for under the nrl contract was million as compared to million for in the future  proton expects to continue to generate revenue from government sponsored research and development contracts to supplement our research and development efforts 
product revenue 
product revenue decreased from million in to million in in the fourth quarter of  hogen product revenues began to be recognized upon shipment 
accordingly  the revenue in represents previously deferred hogen revenue within the warranty period  fourth quarter hogen revenue  product rental revenue  and spare parts revenue 
included in product revenue is hogen product revenue of  laboratory hydrogen generator revenue of  and spare part sales and other revenue of  in the fourth quarter of  proton discovered performance issues relating to the operation of cell stacks and associated sensors in its hogen series units 
proton s investigation of these revealed the presence of previously unknown pinholes in cell membranes in the field that resulted in hydrogen leakage and cell failure 
as a result  proton determined that recognizing revenue on shipment of its hogen series units was no longer appropriate because of significant uncertainty surrounding the reliability of the existing design of the pem electrolyzer cell stack within proton s hogen series generators 
proton is making modifications to the existing cell stack design to improve its performance and anticipate deferring product revenue until it has compiled sufficient warranty history on units containing modified cell stacks 
for this reason  product revenue from hogen series shipments made in the fourth quarter is deferred until the expiration of the product warranty period 
costs of contract revenue 
costs of contract revenue increased from million in to million in the increase in reflects increased costs incurred under the nrl contract 
additionally  cost of contract revenue includes  of charges related to cost overruns on the stm contract and  for warranty claims on the units delivered under the stm contract 
costs of contract revenue as a percentage of contract revenue decreased from in to in costs of contract revenue decreased in as a percentage of contract revenue due to increased activity under the nrl contract  a cost plus fixed fee contract 
proton s contracts are generally cost share arrangements  under which proton is reimbursed only for an agreed portion of its costs incurred to perform under the contract 
the nrl contract is a cost plus fixed fee contract  under which proton is reimbursed for allowable incurred costs plus a fixed fee 
in general  proton is reimbursed for a greater percentage of its costs incurred under a cost plus fixed fee contract than under a cost share arrangement 
costs of production 
costs of production increased from million in to million in costs of production as a percentage of product revenue increased from in to in the amounts in and reflect costs associated with manufacturing and delivering hydrogen generators as well as warranty costs on units in the field 
the increase in costs of production in  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of product revenue  was primarily due to million in costs incurred to address performance problems relating to the operation of cell stacks and associated sensors in the hogen series units 
in  costs of production also include approximately million of previously deferred cost recognized concurrent with the recognition of revenue 
costs of production could increase if warranty experience deteriorates 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was due to an increase in proton s research and development activities 
table of contents related to our pem technology in our regenerative fuel cell systems and our hydrogen generators 
these research and development activities primarily related to increased material purchases and salaries and benefits for research and development staff 
proton expects its research and development expenses to remain level or decrease for the next twelve months 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in this increase reflects an increase in salaries and benefits of million  as a result of an increase in the number of employees  an increase in facility related costs of million  offset by decreases of million in accounting  legal  and investor relations expenses  a decrease in connecticut clean energy fund expenses of million  and a decrease in non cash compensation of million 
interest income 
interest income decreased from million in to million in the decrease resulted from decreased cash and marketable securities balances as well as lower average interest rates 
the average cash and marketable securities balances for and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the average interest rates for and were approximately and  respectively 
factors affecting results of operations the company s contract and product revenues are subject to fluctuations  which may be material 
the company s revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter because i the company s sales cycle is relatively long  ii the size of orders may vary significantly  iii the availability of financing for customers in some countries is variable  iv customers may postpone or cancel orders  and iv economic  political and market conditions in some markets change with minimal notice and affect the timing and size of orders 
because the company s operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels and a high percentage of the company s operating costs are relatively fixed  variations in the timing of revenue recognition may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in august through december  proton financed its operations through convertible preferred stock issuances and an initial public offering that  in total  raised approximately million 
as of december   following the acquisition of northern  distributed energy had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
in december  technology drive llc  a limited liability company wholly owned by proton  entered into a  loan agreement with a major financial institution  in connection with the construction of proton s new facility in wallingford  connecticut 
as of december    was outstanding under this agreement 
under the terms of the loan  the business assets of technology drive llc  including the land and building  are subject to lien 
the loan agreement was structured as a one year construction loan with monthly payments of interest only until december at which time the loan converted to a seven year term note 
the term note amortizes based upon a fifteen year schedule with a final lump sum payment due at the maturity date of december  the note is guaranteed by proton and bears interest at the one month libor plus at december  
in connection with the construction of proton s new wallingford facility  proton entered into a sales and use tax exemption program with the connecticut development authority 
as part of that program  proton has approximately  of restricted cash in escrow 
maturities under the debt at december  are as follows      and thereafter  as part of the acquisition  approximately million of the purchase price was set aside by distributed energy in an escrow account  two thirds of which is payable one year from the acquisition date december  and the remainder is payable two years from the acquisition date december  
as such  
table of contents approximately million is included within restricted cash as part of current assets and approximately  is included within restricted cash as part of long term assets 
at december  proton has guaranteed million of performance bonds issued by a financial institution on behalf of northern 
northern  in connection with its new debt facility and in support of certain of its commercial contracts  also maintains approximately  of restricted cash 
these amounts are included within restricted cash as part of current assets 
at december  proton is committed under operating leases for its rocky hill ct facilities extending through june minimum lease payments under the noncancelable leases at december  are as follows in march  a condominium association  northern power systems commercial condominium association  inc nps condo association  was formed for the purpose of managing the land  building  and improvements related to northern s new facility 
northern owns of the nps condo association and has the ability to exercise significant influence over the nps condo association 
the company transferred certain property and development rights under nps condo assoc to the central vermont economic development corporation cvedc 
in consideration  cvedc secured a  loan from the vermont economic development authority veda to complete the facility and lease back the facility to northern 
the terms of the lease include an initial term of ten years  lease payments equal to the debt payments plus an administrative fee  and a purchase option for northern equal to the outstanding loan amount 
northern has guaranteed the cvedc loan  is responsible for all cost overruns in relation to construction of the new facility  is required to maintain certain levels of insurance over the facility  is required to maintain  of restricted cash for performance under the agreements and indemnifies cvedc from liability or lawsuit relating to the facility 
the agreement also contains a material adverse change clause 
maturities under the capital lease obligation at december  are as follows      and thereafter  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to the company s net loss and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by decreases in inventories and deferred costs and increases in deferred revenues and contract advances 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to the company s net loss and increases in inventory  offset by increases in deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities  cash paid for the acquisition of northern and increases in restricted cash 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities offset by purchases of marketable securities and fixed assets 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to proton s per share cash distribution to stockholders 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily attributable to borrowings under proton s debt agreement 
distributed energy anticipates that its cash and marketable securities on hand as of december  will be adequate to fund its operations  working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
over the next months  distributed energy expects to continue to fund the production of its hydrogen generators and fund on going project costs as well as continuing its research and development activities 
distributed energy cannot ensure that it will not require additional financing to fund its operations or that  if required  any further financing will be available to distributed energy on acceptable terms  or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available  distributed energy may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of its research 
table of contents and development  manufacturing  or contract programs 
the terms of any additional financing may require distributed energy to relinquish rights to its technologies or potential products or other assets 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of distributed energy s contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease operating leases total contractual obligations certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
distributed energy s future success is uncertain because of its limited operating history and project based business 
distributed energy faces many risks and uncertainties 
if it is unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties  it may be unable to generate revenue and grow its business 
proton was formed in to research and develop pem electrochemical products 
proton began shipping late stage development models of its hydrogen generators in and has not yet manufactured commercial regenerative fuel cell systems 
accordingly  there is only a limited basis upon which you can evaluate proton s business and prospects  and proton s future success is uncertain 
you should consider the challenges  expenses  delays and other difficulties typically involved in the establishment of a new business  including the continued development of proton s products  development of fully functioning manufacturing operations  refinement of processes and components for proton s commercial products  recruitment of qualified personnel  ability to manufacture a product which meets cost  reliability and efficiency needs  and achievement of market acceptance for proton s products 
as an engineering  procurement and construction contractor  northern designs and builds a relatively small number of projects for a small number of customers each year 
for many of these customers  northern will deliver a single system with little or no opportunity for repeat business 
a small number of very large projects often accounts for the majority of northern s revenue in any given year 
in years  fewer than five customers accounted for at least of annual sales 
sales cycles are very long and projects can be delayed or cancelled for reasons beyond northern s control 
implementation of large projects can take over twelve months 
during that time  numerous factors can contribute to cost overruns and schedule delays that impact profitability 
generally accepted accounting principles require northern to defer revenue on a significant portion of its contracts until the project is completed 
as a result of these factors and others discussed later in this section  northern s revenue and operating results will vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter within a year 
distributed energy has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  substantial losses  and may never become profitable 
distributed energy has incurred substantial losses since it was founded and anticipates it will continue to incur substantial losses in the future 
as of december   distributed energy had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
distributed energy cannot predict when it will operate profitably  if ever 

table of contents distributed energy expects to continue to incur expenses related to research and development activities  expansion of its manufacturing facilities and general administrative functions 
as a result  distributed energy anticipates that it will continue to incur losses until it can cost effectively produce and sell its hydrogen generators 
even if distributed energy does achieve profitability  distributed energy may be unable to sustain or increase its profitability in the future 
proton has experienced performance problems with its hydrogen generators 
proton has experienced performance problems with certain components of its hydrogen generators  specifically hydrogen sensor modules and cell stacks  which have required component replacement 
further problems related to these or other components may occur and require additional corrective measures 
if proton is unable to solve these problems  potential purchasers of proton products may decline to purchase them 
in addition  if proton s hydrogen generators fail after purchase  proton s warranty exposure would increase  resulting in higher costs 
proton may not be able to generate revenue in the future if it does not complete the development of its regenerative fuel cell systems 
proton s regenerative fuel cell systems are still in the development stage 
proton does not know when or whether it will successfully complete research and development of commercial regenerative fuel cell systems 
if proton is unable to develop commercial regenerative fuel cell systems  it may not be able to generate future revenue and may not recover the losses it has incurred in attempting to develop these products 
if proton experiences delays in meeting its development milestones or if its regenerative fuel cell systems exhibit technical defects or cannot meet cost or performance goals  including output  useful life and reliability goals  potential purchasers of proton s regenerative fuel cell systems may decline to purchase them or choose alternative technologies 
proton may be unable to make the substantial technological advances necessary to produce commercial regenerative fuel cell systems that provide the features and performance specifications required by customers at a competitive price 
for example  proton must identify improved hydrogen storage technologies and fuel cell module structures 
if proton is unable to successfully complete these development activities  proton may be unable to commercially market its regenerative fuel cell systems 
in some cases  proton is attempting to expedite its development efforts by utilizing third parties for important engineering work 
these third parties include vendors of hydrogen storage  purification systems  power supply and control components 
if these third parties are unable to successfully complete their development activities on proton s behalf  proton may be unable to commercially market its regenerative fuel cell systems 
proton may not be able to grow its business if it does not achieve widespread commercial acceptance of its hydrogen generators in the market for delivered hydrogen 
in addition proton intends to market its hydrogen generators to small and medium volume users of delivered hydrogen 
proton s business depends on the widespread commercial acceptance of its hydrogen generators  and proton may be unable to grow its business if proton s targeted customers do not purchase substantial numbers of proton s hydrogen generators 
proton s targeted customers  or the distributors whom proton intends to use to market to these customers  may not purchase proton s hydrogen generators at all or in sufficient quantities to support the growth of proton s business 
proton s hydrogen generators will require its target customers to make a substantial initial investment  currently ranging from approximately  to  per unit for proton s hogen and h series models 
proton s method of supplying hydrogen by producing it on site using pem electrolysis represents a significant departure from conventional means of supplying hydrogen to end users 
pem electrolysis is a new and unproven technology in the markets proton is targeting  and proton does not know if its targeted customers will accept proton s product 
proton is also working to develop and implement design improvements to extend the life of its cell stack components 
if proton is unable to successfully complete these activities  sales of its hydrogen generators may be reduced 

table of contents the success of proton s hydrogen generators as a fuel source for pem fuel cells depends upon the development of a mass market for pem fuel cells  and proton may not be able to generate revenue in the future if this market does not develop 
proton also intends to market its hydrogen generators for use as fuel generators for pem fuel cells in a variety of applications  in particular fuel cell vehicles 
if a mass market for pem fuel cells fails to develop or develops more slowly than proton anticipates  proton may be unable to generate revenue in the future and recover the losses it will have incurred in the development of its hydrogen generators 
pem fuel cells represent an emerging commercial market  and proton does not know whether end users will want to use them 
the development of a mass market for pem fuel cells may be affected by many factors outside of proton s control  including the emergence of newer  more competitive technologies  the cost competitiveness of pem fuel cells compared to existing and new technologies  the future cost of hydrogen  regulatory requirements  consumer perceptions of the safety  reliability and functionality of pem fuel cells  and consumer willingness to try a new product 
in addition  the sole market for vehicular pem fuel cells is and will continue to be car  bus and other vehicle manufacturers 
automobile manufacturers interest in vehicular pem fuel cells has been driven in large part by environmental laws and regulations concerning vehicle emission requirements that have been enacted in california and some northeastern states 
if these laws and regulations are not kept in force or do not become widely adopted  the demand for vehicular pem fuel cells may be limited 
further  automobile manufacturers may be able to use other technologies to meet their regulatory requirements  such as batteries  low emission internal combustion engines and hybrid internal combustion battery engines 
even if automobile manufacturers decide to develop vehicles powered by pem fuel cells  it may be many years before substantial numbers of vehicles powered by pem fuel cell systems are manufactured 
further  there are several other technologies that may be used to generate hydrogen  such as hydrocarbon reforming  and there remains a strong possibility that proton s means of generating hydrogen will not be used to supply fuel to fuel cells 
proton may be unable to increase its revenue in the future if the use of renewable energy does not increase 
proton anticipates that one of the primary uses of its regenerative fuel cell systems will be for storing energy produced by renewable power sources  such as solar  wind and hydroelectric power 
if the demand for renewable energy develops more slowly than proton anticipates  proton s ability to sell its regenerative fuel cell systems could be impaired  and proton may be unable to grow its business 
the market for renewable energy is still in an early stage of development and the demand for renewable energy will remain limited until the cost of producing energy from renewable sources is substantially reduced 
power from renewable energy sources currently costs significantly more than power derived from nonrenewable sources  such as coal and oil 
the growth of the renewable energy market will be dependent on many factors that are outside of proton s control  such as the emergence of new  more cost effective power technologies and products  and domestic and international regulatory requirements 
proton expects to incur significant expenses in expanding its manufacturing facilities and production  and proton may not be successful in these efforts 
proton has expanded its manufacturing facilities in anticipation of increased demand for its products 
if this demand does not materialize  proton will not generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs of maintaining and operating these facilities  which could increase proton s losses and prevent proton from growing its business 

table of contents proton expects to expand production and may experience delays or problems in its expected expansion that could compromise its ability to increase its sales and grow its business 
factors that could delay or prevent proton s expected production expansion include the inability to purchase parts or components in adequate quantities or sufficient quality  the cost of raw materials  the failure to increase assembly and test operations  the failure to hire and train additional manufacturing personnel  and the failure to develop and implement manufacturing processes and equipment 
if proton fails to successfully manufacture its products in commercial quantities  it may not be able to increase revenue 
to be financially successful  proton will have to manufacture its products in commercial quantities at acceptable costs while also preserving the quality levels achieved in manufacturing these products in limited quantities 
this presents a number of technological and engineering challenges 
proton may not be successful in developing product designs and manufacturing processes that permit manufacture of its hydrogen generators and regenerative fuel cell systems in commercial quantities at commercially acceptable costs while preserving quality 
currently  proton sells some of its products for less than it costs to produce them 
in addition  proton will incur significant manufacturing start up costs and may experience unforeseen delays and expenses in its product design and manufacturing efforts 
if the commercialization of proton s products is delayed  potential purchasers may also decline to purchase them or choose alternative technologies  both of which could impair proton s ability to generate revenue in the future 
if proton s suppliers do not supply it with a sufficient amount and quality of components at acceptable prices  proton may not be able to manufacture its products commercially 
although proton generally attempts to use standard components for its products  the proton exchange membrane material and hydrogen purification system used in proton s products are currently available only from limited sources 
also  proton may be unable to purchase components of adequate quality or that meet its cost requirements 
in addition  to the extent these components are proprietary products of proton s suppliers  or the processes used by proton s suppliers to manufacture these components are proprietary  proton may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers 
proton may experience delays in production of its products and its business and financial results would suffer if it fails to identify alternate suppliers  or if proton s supply is interrupted or reduced or there is a significant increase in cost 
in addition  platinum is a key component of proton s pem fuel cells 
platinum is a scarce natural resource and proton is dependent upon a sufficient supply of this commodity 
proton may not be able to produce commercial products  or the cost of producing products may significantly increase  if there are any shortages in the supply of platinum 
proton may be unable to sell its products and generate revenue if it fails to establish distribution relationships 
because proton intends to sell some of its products through third party distributors  the financial benefits to proton of commercializing its products will be dependent on the efforts of others 
proton intends to enter into additional distribution agreements or other collaborative relationships to market and sell its products 
if proton is unable to enter into additional distribution agreements  or if its third party distributors do not successfully market and sell its products  proton may be unable to generate revenue and grow its business 
proton may seek to establish relationships with third party distributors who also indirectly compete with proton 
for example  proton has targeted industrial gas suppliers as potential distributors of its hydrogen generators 
because industrial gas suppliers currently sell hydrogen in delivered form  adoption by their customers of proton s hydrogen generation 
table of contents products could cause them to experience declining demand for delivered hydrogen 
for this reason  industrial gas suppliers may be reluctant to become distributors of proton s hydrogen generators 
in addition  proton s third party distributors may require proton to provide volume price discounts and other allowances  or customize its products  either of which could reduce the potential profitability of these relationships 
proton has historically focused on research and development activities and has limited experience in marketing  selling and servicing its products 
proton has primarily focused on the research and development of its hydrogen generators and regenerative fuel cell systems 
consequently  proton s management team has limited experience directing the commercialization efforts that are essential to proton s future success 
to date  proton only has limited experience marketing  selling and servicing its hydrogen generators  and no experience marketing  selling or servicing its regenerative fuel cell systems 
furthermore  there are very few people anywhere who have significant experience marketing  selling or servicing pem electrochemical products 
proton will have to expand its marketing and sales organization as well as its maintenance and support capability 
proton may not be successful in its efforts to market and service its products  which would compromise its ability to increase revenue 
because northern s projects have a very lengthy sales cycle and are often competitively bid  northern may expend significant resources on potential customers and projects without achieving actual sales 
northern depends on a small number of large projects for a majority of its revenue in any given year 
contracts for many of these large projects are awarded by competitive bid 
the sales cycle from identification of a project opportunity to award of a contract often exceeds one year 
with multiple other bidders on most large project opportunities  northern often cannot accurately assess its probability of winning the contract prior to its award by the customer 
most large domestic distributed generation project opportunities are discretionary purchases for the customer  and as a result  at the end of the sales cycle many such projects may never materialize for reasons beyond northern s control 
during this lengthy sales cycle  northern may incur significant expense and expend significant management effort 
these factors make it very difficult for northern to generate firm backlog well in advance of the actual projects and to accurately forecast future sales 
if northern s sales forecasts from a specific project or customer for a particular period are not realized in that period  it may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm its operating results 
northern conducts business in many countries that are politically and economically unstable 
the potential for political unrest  acts of terrorism and war  and economic collapse exists in many countries in which northern does business 
the occurrence of any such events at or near the site of northern s projects could lead to delay  cancellation  or significant damage to northern s projects or equipment 
the occurrence of any such events could also cause harm  injury or death to northern personnel working on such projects 
any such events could expose northern to significant liabilities and would therefore adversely impact northern s operating results and growth 
if northern fails to develop and commercialize new products and technology  it may not be able to increase its revenues 
while northern does not derive any revenue from the sale of any products today  its business plan contemplates that a portion of its future revenue will be derived from the sale and or licensing of new wind turbine and power electronics products which are currently under development and not yet commercially available 
many of these future products and technologies are based on new and unproven designs and it is difficult to predict whether they will be commercially viable 
if northern fails to successfully develop and commercialize these products and technologies  it will be unable to recover the investments it has made in their development and will be unable to grow its revenue from their sales and or licensing 
in addition  northern is likely to face significant competition in the market for these future products 
many of northern s competitors in 
table of contents the markets for these products are larger and better capitalized than northern  are better established with a worldwide presence  and are already selling competing products in these markets 
new technology developments or cost reductions in existing technologies may delay or prevent the development and or sale of some or all of northern s planned products or make its planned products uncompetitive or obsolete 
northern may not be able to grow its revenues in the future if a sustainable market for distributed generation does not develop 
northern s future growth is based in part on increased use of distributed generation technologies 
distributed generation is an emerging market  and it is difficult to predict the rate at which it will develop 
if a sustainable market for distributed generation fails to develop or develops more slowly than northern anticipates  its ability to grow and achieve profitability will be negatively impacted 
many of the factors that influence the rate of adoption of distributed generation technologies are out of northern s control 
some such factors that northern cannot control are utility electric rates  changes in federal  state and local regulatory requirements  changes in federal and state incentives and subsidies  cost  quality  performance and availability of the alternative generating technologies that northern uses in its onsite power systems  costs and availability of natural gas and other fuels used in alternative generating technologies  changes in commercial and industrial customers perceptions regarding distributed generation availability of financing for distributed generation vendors  developers and users  economic downturns and related reductions in capital spending  and demand for and valuation of emissions trading credits generated by distributed generation systems 
northern s future growth depends on its ability to provide distributed generation systems that deliver electricity at a price that is competitive with the utility grid  significant declines in the price of utility delivered electricity or northern s inability to continue to reduce the cost of its distributed generation systems could reduce demand for its services and products 
northern competes mainly on price per delivered kilowatt hour of electricity to the end user 
in its domestic markets  northern is competing against the cost of electricity delivered by the local utilities through the electric grid 
the cost of electricity varies widely from utility to utility and from state to state and is subject to change based on factors beyond northern s control 
northern cannot accurately predict what future electric rates will be and whether or not it can compete effectively against these rates 
the cost per delivered kilowatt hour of electricity generated by northern s onsite power systems is also based primarily on the following three factors the cost of the underlying generating technologies  the cost of financing  and the cost of fuel 
all these factors are outside of northern s control 
costs of alternative generating technologies like solar panels  wind turbines  fuel cells and microturbines have generally been falling over the past several years  but there can be no assurances that they will continue to fall in the future 
without federal or state subsidies or incentives  the cost of these technologies is often not competitive with traditional generating technologies or the cost of utility power 
if the costs of these alternative technologies do not continue to fall or subsidies are no longer available  northern s ability to sell its systems and services based on these technologies will be diminished 

table of contents financing costs are critical to the cost competitiveness of renewable energy systems in particular  because  since the fuel from the wind or sun is free  they represent the single largest operating cost 
financing costs are also highly variable and subject to change beyond northern s control 
for reciprocating engine or turbines based power systems  fuel is the largest operating cost 
the predominant fuel for these systems is natural gas 
the price of natural gas has been highly volatile and is currently projected to remain high for years to come based on increased demand and limited domestic supply 
sustained high gas prices reduce the economic benefit of the onsite power systems northern sells and may therefore result in reduced sales and revenue growth for northern 
because northern s sales are reliant in part on federal and state subsidies and incentives  any reduction in federal and state subsidy programs could harm northern s business 
northern s domestic market for distributed generation systems currently benefits from many federal and state programs designed to promote increased use of renewable and alternative generating technologies 
the federal government  for example  offers tax credits for energy produced by wind and solar generators 
states like california  new york  new jersey  connecticut and massachusetts offer cash incentives which reduce the initial capital cost to customers who invest in renewable and distributed generation systems 
all these federal and state incentive and subsidy programs have specific expiration dates and there can be no assurance that these programs will be extended 
termination of these programs may have an adverse impact on northern s future growth 
also  given the economic downturn and resulting budget deficits  funding for many of the state programs is at risk of being diverted to other needs 
decreases in the price of oil and gas could reduce demand for northern s systems  which would have an adverse impact on its revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
a large portion of northern s current revenue is generated from the sale of remote power systems to the international oil and gas industry for use on remote pipelines and offshore platforms 
demand for northern s power systems from this market segment depends in part on the current and future commodity price of oil and gas 
higher oil and gas prices stimulate increased development of remote oil and gas fields and related infrastructure  which in turn stimulates increased demand for remote power systems of the type northern supplies 
conversely  lower oil and gas prices would reduce demand for northern s systems and have a negative impact on its growth 
northern depends on a small number of customers  and termination of a project by one or more of these customers could harm northern s business in years  over of northern s annual sales came from five or fewer customers 
typically the sales to these customers come from single contracts to provide highly specialized onsite power systems custom designed and built to meet their specifications 
because such a high percentage of northern s sales are concentrated in so few contracts  failure on the part of northern or northern s customers to perform or deliver on any one of these contracts could have a major impact on northern s annual operating results 
in addition  most of northern s customer contracts are terminable on short notice 
this high concentration of sales in a small number of customers also subjects northern to a high degree of customer credit risk and risk of non performance by its vendors 
a single vendor s late delivery of a key component required for a project  for example  could significantly delay northern s completion of the project and trigger liquidated or consequential damages or other penalties as may be stipulated in northern s contracts with its customers 
continued uncertainty in domestic and world economies and energy markets may limit northern s growth 
current uncertainty among northern s target customers over the health of the economy and its impact on their business has restricted their capital spending and made it harder for northern to sell its systems and services 
other market uncertainties that also impact northern s ability to increase sales include the future of 
table of contents deregulation of the domestic electricity market  the future price of oil and natural gas  political instability in the middle east and other regions where it does business  and domestic and international policy responses to the threat of global warming 
northern relies on third party suppliers and subcontractors for certain components and services  and northern could suffer losses if these suppliers and subcontractors fail to fulfill its needs 
while most of northern s components are available from multiple suppliers  many new technologies that northern uses in its systems are only available from a very limited number of suppliers and in some cases only a single supplier 
often northern s suppliers custom build components to northern s specifications for use in a particular project and delayed deliveries  poor quality and warranty issues can delay its projects  reduce its profits and damage its relationships with its end customers 
particularly for newer technologies  technical and financial problems of the manufacturer could also delay northern s projects  increase its costs and even cause customers to terminate northern s contracts if northern s vendors are unable to deliver the key components or technology on which its projects are based 
particularly in northern s domestic commercial and industrial projects  northern relies heavily on electrical  mechanical  civil and structural subcontractors to build and install its systems at its customers facilities based on detailed specifications and drawings that northern provide 
often these subcontracted services account for a high percentage of the overall project cost 
northern s subcontractors failure to perform their services in a timely and quality manner can lead to significant schedule delays  increased costs and performance issues on northern s projects 
these issues can potentially trigger penalties in northern s contracts  increase its warranty exposure  reduce its profits and damage its relationships with its customers if not managed appropriately 
northern may not be able to develop and or retain relationships with strategic partners 
northern currently works with a number of strategic partners that facilitate and enhance many aspects of its business  including technology development  component supply  sales lead generation  engineering support  and project installation 
northern must continue to expand these relationships and develop new relationships in order to grow its current project based business and its future product based business 
failure to do so would negatively impact northern s future sales growth and operating results 
northern s projects are subject to varying levels of sales and other taxes and northern therefore incurs significant potential tax liability 
northern has sold and continues to sell its power systems in numerous local  state and foreign jurisdictions 
each jurisdiction s sales and income tax rules and regulations are different and evolving 
northern and its auditors often must make subjective judgments as to whether or not it has established tax nexus in certain jurisdictions where it sells its services and systems and as to whether and how much tax is due on these sales 
northern may be audited at any time by any jurisdiction where it has done business and may be required to pay additional taxes  penalties and interest 
there can be no assurances that northern has not or will not incur additional tax liabilities over and above what is currently recognized in its audited financial statements and its unaudited interim financial statements 
undetected and unanticipated defects in northern s distributed generation systems could increase northern s costs and harm its reputation 
distributed generation systems designed and installed by northern often use new and untested technologies 
many of these new technologies have limited operating histories and may be subject to malfunction or failure when subjected to prolonged use in non test conditions 
should these new technologies fail to perform as specified by their vendors  northern may incur additional warranty and other costs and its relationships with its customers may suffer 
also  many vendors of these new technologies have limited financial resources and may not be able to adequately support their products in the field 
all these issues would reduce northern s growth and profitability 

table of contents northern depends on government contracts for a portion of its revenue and profits 
northern s government contracts relate to research and development on renewable energy technologies  hybrid system architectures  and advanced power electronics 
changes in government policy toward distributed generation or budget restrictions may reduce or eliminate funding for these types of research and development activities 
there can be no assurance that northern s current contracts will be fully funded or that northern will be able to secure additional government contracts for similar activities in the future 
northern is also subject to annual audits of its incurred costs on its government contracts by the defense contracting audit agency 
if northern s actual overhead cost included in its incurred costs are less than the allowable overhead costs billed on these contracts  northern may be required to refund the excess overhead costs to the government upon completion of the dcaa audit 
such a refund would negatively impact northern s financial position and its revenue and profits in the year in which such costs were incurred 
if distributed energy fails to retain its key personnel and attract and retain additional qualified personnel  it may be unable to develop its products and generate revenue 
distributed energy s success depends upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key employees such as manufacturing and research and development personnel 
the loss of any of distributed energy s executive officers or key employees  especially walter w 
schroeder or clint coleman could impair distributed energy s ability to pursue its growth strategy 
distributed energy does not have employment agreements with any of its key executives 
distributed energy may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
distributed energy currently faces and will continue to face significant competition  which could cause it to lose sales or render its products and services uncompetitive or obsolete 
the markets for delivered hydrogen and reliable backup power are highly competitive 
there are a number of companies located in the united states  canada and abroad that deliver hydrogen  sell hydrogen generation equipment or are developing pem fuel cell technology 
many of these companies have substantially greater resources than proton does 
each of these companies has the potential to capture market share in the markets proton intends to address  which could cause proton to lose sales and prevent proton from growing its business 
new developments in technology may also delay or prevent the development or sale of some or all of proton s products or make its products uncompetitive or obsolete 
if this were to occur  proton would not be able to generate sufficient revenue to offset the cost of developing its hydrogen generators and regenerative fuel cell systems 
proton s regenerative fuel cell systems are one of a number of power technology products being developed today to provide high quality  highly reliable backup power to the existing electric transmission system  or grid 
these products include advanced batteries  ultracapacitors  microturbines  flywheels  internal combustion generator sets  superconducting magnetic energy storage devices  other fuel cell types and fuel cells using alternative hydrogen supply applications 
improvements are also being made to the existing electric grid 
technological advances in power technology products and improvements in the electric grid may reduce the attractiveness of proton s regenerative fuel cell systems 
as the markets for pem fuel cell related products  on site hydrogen generation and backup power develop  other large industrial companies may enter these fields and compete with proton 
these large industrial companies may have the research and development  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources necessary to commercialize hydrogen generators and regenerative fuel cell systems more quickly and effectively than proton does 
the distributed generation market is also highly competitive and evolving rapidly 
northern faces a wide variety of competitors  including equipment manufacturers  distributors  packagers  system integrators  general contractors  engineering firms  project developers  and energy service companies 
many of northern s 
table of contents competitors are significantly larger and better capitalized than northern  and therefore may be able to devote more resources to the following activities that allow them to establish a competitive advantage in the marketplace sales and marketing of their products and services  seller financing for the sale of their product or services  development and commercialization of new technologies  partnering and other collaborative efforts with sales channel partners  vendors and technology providers  expanded design  engineering and other fulfillment and service capabilities  and systems and other infrastructure development that reduces costs 
distributed energy depends on its intellectual property  and distributed energy s failure to protect it could enable competitors to market products with similar features that may reduce demand for distributed energy s products 
if distributed energy is unable to protect its intellectual property  distributed energy s competitors could use its intellectual property to market products similar to its products  which could reduce demand for distributed energy s products 
distributed energy s success depends substantially upon the internally developed technology that is incorporated in its products 
proton distributed energy may be unable to prevent unauthorized parties from attempting to copy or otherwise obtain and use its products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of distributed energy s technology is difficult  and distributed energy may not be able to prevent misappropriation of its technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect distributed energy s intellectual property as fully as those in the united states 
others may circumvent the trade secrets  trademarks and copyrights that distributed energy owns  and any of the us patents or foreign patents owned by distributed energy or subsequently issued to distributed energy may be invalidated  circumvented  challenged or rendered unenforceable 
in addition  distributed energy may not be issued any patents as a result of its pending and future patent applications  and any patents issued to distributed energy may not have the breadth of claim coverage sought by distributed energy 
most of distributed energy s intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application 
distributed energy seeks to protect this proprietary intellectual property  which includes intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable  in part by confidentiality agreements with its distributors and employees 
these agreements afford only limited protection and may not provide distributed energy with adequate remedies for any breach or prevent other persons or institutions from asserting rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships 
distributed energy could incur substantial costs defending its intellectual property from infringement by others 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of distributed energy s products or to obtain and use its proprietary information 
litigation may be necessary to enforce distributed energy s intellectual property rights  to protect its trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources with no assurance of success 
distributed energy could incur substantial costs defending against claims that its products infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
the patent situation in the field of pem fuel cell technology is complex 
a large number of patents  including overlapping patents  relating to this technology have been granted worldwide 
distributed energy is aware of patents in the fuel cell architecture field held by potential competitors and other third parties  including 
table of contents ballard power systems  general motors  giner  h power  oronzio denora impianti electrochemical  packard instrument  plug power  shinko pantec  siemens  toyota  united technologies and whatman 
third parties could claim infringement by proton with respect to these patents or other patents or proprietary rights  and proton may not prevail in any such proceeding 
northern is aware of a patent held by general electric with respect to variable speed wind turbines 
if northern incorporates variable speed wind turbine technology into future wind related generation products and is not able to design and engineer non infringing technology  it may be required to license this technology from general electric 
if northern is unsuccessful in developing non infringing technologies  it may be required to cease or redirect its development efforts or obtain licensing  royalty or other agreements 
there can be no assurance that northern can obtain such licensing or other agreements on favorable terms or at all  in which case northern s ability to execute its business plan  grow its sales and generate a profit may be adversely affected 
in addition  some of distributed energy s employees are parties to assignment of invention and nondisclosure agreements with their former employers 
these agreements generally grant the former employer rights to technology developed by the employee while employed by the former employer and prohibit disclosure of that technology or other employer information to third parties 
distributed energy cannot assure that such employers will not assert claims against distributed energy or its employees alleging a breach of those agreements or other violations of their proprietary rights or alleging rights to inventions by distributed energy s employees  or that distributed energy would prevail in any such proceeding 
any infringement claim against distributed energy  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or arbitration and diversion of technical and management personnel  or require distributed energy to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
distributed energy might not be successful in developing non infringing technologies 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to distributed energy  or at all  and could significantly harm its business and operating results 
a successful claim of infringement against distributed energy or its failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could require distributed energy to pay substantial damages and could harm its business because it would not be able to sell the affected product without redeveloping the product or incurring significant additional expense 
in addition  to the extent distributed energy agrees to indemnify customers or other third parties against infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  a claim of infringement could require distributed energy to incur substantial time  effort and expense to indemnify these customers and third parties and could disrupt or terminate their ability to use  market or sell distributed energy s products 
distributed energy may be exposed to lawsuits and other claims if its products or systems malfunction or fail  which could increase distributed energy s expenses  harm its reputation and prevent distributed energy from growing its business 
any liability for damages resulting from malfunctions or failures of distributed energy s products or systems could be substantial and could increase distributed energy s expenses and prevent distributed energy from growing its business 
in particular  hydrogen is a flammable gas and can pose safety risks if not handled properly 
proton has experienced an instance with one of its products where hydrogen appears to have leaked into the ambient oxygen stream resulting in a flame that burned several components in the system 
further investigation of this unit revealed the presence of pinholes in the cell membranes  resulting in hydrogen leakage and cell failure 
although proton has taken steps to improve safety and reliability in its products  proton cannot be certain that future similar instances will not occur 
in addition  proton s products may require modifications to operate properly under extreme temperatures 
potential customers will also rely upon proton s products for 
table of contents critical needs  such as backup power 
a malfunction of proton s products could result in significant tort or warranty claims 
in addition  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect the market s perception of proton s products 
this could result in a decline in demand for proton s products  which would reduce proton s revenue and harm its business 
northern s standard power system warranty includes a one year warranty period for defects in design  materials and workmanship of its systems 
northern has not provided guarantees of the performance of its systems to date but may be required to do so in the future 
most of its systems are custom designed to individual customers specifications and may include new and unproven technologies  system architectures  and component configurations 
many of its systems are also located in very remote locations with extremely harsh climates that are difficult and expensive to access 
the possibility of system failures could cause northern to incur significant expense to redesign  reengineer  repair and or replace defective systems or system components 
furthermore  northern projects often have high visibility in its target markets  so that any such failures could damage its reputation and limit future sales in these markets 
government regulations may impair distributed energy s ability to market and sell its products 
proton s products are potentially subject to federal  local and foreign laws and regulations governing  among other things  emissions to air as well as laws relating to occupational health and safety 
proton may incur substantial costs or liabilities in complying with governmental regulations 
proton s potential customers must also comply with numerous laws and regulations  which could affect their interest in proton s products 
proton could incur potentially significant expenditures in complying with environmental and health and safety laws  regulations and requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
electricity generation and delivery are both heavily regulated by federal and state governments 
while deregulation and restructuring of the us electric industry may ultimately expand the market for distributed generation systems of the type that northern sells  recent problems associated with deregulation in key domestic markets like california may impose additional barriers to distributed generation 
california and other states  for example  allow utilities to impose exit fees  standby charges and other penalties on customers who install distributed generation systems 
federal and state regulations regarding air quality and interconnection to the utility grid also impose additional costs and potential liabilities on our business 
changes in these regulations could reduce or eliminate northern s access to certain of its target markets 
distributed energy s failure to manage growth could harm its business 
distributed energy intends to introduce new products  increase its production capacity and develop additional distributor relationships 
if distributed energy is successful  a significant strain on its senior management team and other resources may result 
in addition  distributed energy may be required to hire additional senior management personnel 
distributed energy s ability to manage growth will depend in part on its ability to continue to enhance its operating  financial and management information systems 
distributed energy s personnel  systems and controls may be unable to support its growth 
distributed energy may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to grow its business 
proton and northern have regularly needed to raise funds to operate their businesses 
proton believes it may need to raise additional funds to achieve full commercialization of some or all of its products 
northern s project based business requires a significant amount of capital in order to increase the number and size of projects it can undertake and therefore increase its revenues 
if distributed energy is unable to raise additional funds when needed  the ability of proton and northern to operate and grow their businesses could be impaired 
distributed energy does not know whether it will be able to secure additional funding or funding on terms acceptable to it 
distributed energy s ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  its operating performance and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional funding unattractive 
if distributed energy issues additional equity securities  
table of contents existing stockholders may experience dilution or be subordinated to any rights  preferences or privileges granted to the new equity holders 
distributed energy s revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of distributed energy s control  which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline 
distributed energy expects its revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result  quarterly comparisons of distributed energy s financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of distributed energy s future performance 
in addition  due to distributed energy s stage of development  it cannot predict its future revenue or results of operations accurately 
as a consequence  distributed energy s operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of distributed energy s common stock to decline 
factors that may affect distributed energy s operating results include the status of development of distributed energy s technology  products and manufacturing capabilities  the cost of raw materials and key components  warranty and service cost for products in the field  the introduction  timing and market acceptance of new products introduced by distributed energy or its competitors  the development of strategic relationships and distribution channels  general economic conditions  which can affect customers capital investments and the length of sales cycles  the development of vehicular pem fuel cells and renewable energy markets  and government regulation 
distributed energy expects to make significant investments in all areas of its business  particularly in research and product development and in expanding its manufacturing capability 
because the investments associated with these activities are relatively fixed in the short term  distributed energy may be unable to adjust its spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in its revenue growth 
in addition  because distributed energy is in the very early stages of selling its products and has a limited number of customers  distributed energy expects its order flow to be uneven from period to period 
distributed energy s current or planned international operations subject its business to additional risks  which could cause revenues to decline 
for the past three years  northern has generated a majority of its revenue from sales of remote power projects in the oil and gas and telecommunications markets 
many of these projects are sold to foreign entities and are delivered to locations outside of the united states  such as the middle east  eurasia  africa  and south america 
selling northern s services internationally exposes it to many additional costs  risks  and potential liabilities  which  if improperly managed  could limit its ability to grow in these markets and adversely impact its operating results 
in addition proton intends to market its hydrogen generators to small and medium volume users of delivered hydrogen 
proton s business depends on the widespread commercial acceptance of its hydrogen generators  and proton may be unable to grow its business if proton s targeted customers do not purchase substantial numbers of proton s hydrogen generators 
proton s targeted customers  or the distributors whom proton intends to use to market to these customers  may not purchase proton s hydrogen generators at all or in sufficient quantities to support the growth of proton s business 
costs  risks and potential liabilities faced by distributed energy as a result of international operations include complying with the commercial and legal requirements of foreign markets  particularly in developing countries  obtaining and or enforcing intellectual property protection  
table of contents overcoming trade barriers such as duties  tariffs and taxes  enforcing contract terms and conditions  collecting receivables  and managing operations and staff across disparate geographic areas 
in addition  a change in the value of the us dollar may make northern s services and products less competitive in international markets 
because distributed energy relies on third parties to fund a portion of its research and development relating to new products  any decrease in such third party funding could limit its ability to develop new products 
distributed energy receives significant external funding from the department of energy  the national renewable energy laboratory and other public and private entities for the development of its proprietary products and technology 
changes in government policy toward distributed generation or budget restrictions may reduce or eliminate funding from these sources for these types of research and development activities 
if such funding was discontinued  distributed energy may not have sufficient internal funding to continue with these development efforts and may therefore have to reduce its development of these products  delay their development or abandon them altogether 
discontinuation or delay in its development of proprietary products and technology could limit distributed energy s ability to execute its business plan and may have an adverse impact on its ability to increase revenues and generate a profit
