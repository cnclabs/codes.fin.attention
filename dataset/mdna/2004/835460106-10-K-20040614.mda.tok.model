item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that make future results difficult to predict  certain items to remember when reading our financial statements our quarterly and annual operating results vary significantly depending on the timing of new product introductions and enhancements by ourselves and by our competitors 
our results also depend on the volume and timing of our professional customer orders and on shipments of our original equipment manufacturer oem partners which are difficult to forecast 
because our professional customers generally order on an as needed basis and we normally ship products within one week after receipt of an order  and because our oem partners report shipments during or after the end of the period  we do not have an order backlog which can assist us in forecasting results 
for these reasons  as well as those described under risk factors  our results of operations for any quarter or any year are a poor indicator of the results to be expected in any future quarter or year 
a large portion of our quarterly professional product revenue usually is generated in the last few weeks of the quarter 
since our ongoing operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we plan our expenditures based primarily on sales forecasts  if oem partner shipments do not meet our forecast or if professional revenue generated in the last few weeks of a quarter or year do not meet our forecast  operating results can be very negatively affected 
overview we develop and market computer based tools for creating digital audio and video titles in the cd audio and dvd video formats and in related formats  for recording data files on cd recordable or dvd recordable discs in the cd rom and dvd rom formats  and for backing up the information contained on hard discs attached to computers 
most of the products we sell consist entirely of computer software  though some of the tools we sell include plug in computer hardware 
we also license the software technology underlying our tools to various other companies to incorporate in products they develop 
our business is divided into two reporting segments  our consumer segment and our professional audio and video segment 
we divide our products into three categories professional audio and video products  desktop products and technology products 
during fiscal year  we experienced continued growth in our net revenue as well as growth in our profitability and net income 
our revenue growth for fiscal year  which amounted to an increase of from the same period in the prior year  was driven mainly by an increase in sales of our consumer products primarily through new and existing oem licensing agreements  including oem licensing agreements assumed in connection with our acquisition of the veritas dmd business 
international sales increased to of our net revenue for fiscal year  up from of our net revenue for fiscal year approximately of our net revenue for fiscal year resulted from three customers 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management is also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates including those relating to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on the specific circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact the most significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we follow very specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue 
certain judgments  however  affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
we have adopted statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop deferral of the effective date of a provision of sop  and sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain arrangements and in certain instances we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
sop requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  hardware  upgrades  enhancements  maintenance and support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on their relative fair values 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence 
we derive our software revenue primarily from licenses of our software products including any related hardware components  development agreements and maintenance and support 
revenue recognized from multiple element software arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of elements 
the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence specific to us 
objective evidence of fair values of all elements of an arrangement is based upon our standard pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
objective evidence of support services is generally measured by annual renewal rates 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with sop the difference between the total software arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product including hardware has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable 
in addition  royalty revenue from certain distributors that do not meet our credit standards  as well as revenues from our distributor agreement with daikin 
table of contents industries are recognized upon sell through to the end customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than one year not to be fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
revenue from development agreements  whereby the development is essential to the functionality of the licensed software  is recognized over the service period based on proportional performance 
under this method  management is required to estimate the number of hours needed to complete a particular project  and revenues and profits are recognized as the contract progresses to completion 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenues have not been recognized which results from the following deferred maintenance and support  amounts billed to certain distributors for our products not yet sold to the end user customers  amounts billed in excess of services performed to technology customers for license and development agreements  and amounts billed to certain oems for products which contain one or more undelivered elements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our portfolio of receivables 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates impairing their ability to make payments  or if payments from customers are significantly delayed  additional allowances might be required 
capitalized software we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such capitalized costs are amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated economic life of the product  which is generally three years 
periodically  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues  reduced by the estimated future cost of sales  the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products  and the future cost of sales 
if these estimates change  write offs of capitalized software costs could result 
business acquisitions  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets our business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of current and future period charges and amortization expense 
the determination of value of these components of a business combination  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make various estimates and assumptions 
estimates using different  but each reasonable  assumptions could produce significantly different results 
on april  we adopted sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of impairment of goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined in sfas goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process at the reporting unit level 
first  we determine if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we will compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
as a result of 
table of contents our ravisent product business acquisition during the quarter ended june   our dmd acquisition from veritas during the quarter ended december   and our interactual technologies  inc acquisition during the quarter ended march   we have recorded a total of million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
as of march   no events have occurred that would lead us to believe that there has been any impairment 
stock based compensation we follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
see note and to our consolidated financial statements for march   and included elsewhere in this annual report for further discussion of our stock based compensation plans  including the illustration of the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
impairment of long lived assets on april   we adopted sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes certain provisions of apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions and supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in accordance with sfas  we evaluate long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we do not have any long lived assets which we consider to be impaired as of march  other disclosures investment in sonicstudio llc in march  we executed an agreement to form a new company  sonicstudio llc in partnership with a limited liability corporation controlled by two individuals 
under the terms of the agreement  we transferred our sonicstudio workstation business to sonicstudio llc and licensed this company to utilize the technology underlying sonicstudio in the professional audio workstation market 
the book value of net assets and liabilities transferred to sonicstudio llc  totaled  we accounted for this investment in sonicstudio llc using the modified equity method 
as of march   our investment in sonicstudio llc is recorded at zero 
under the terms of the agreement  sonicstudio llc compensated us for the sonic studio workstation business with a three year promissory note for  the promissory note  which does not carry interest  will be repaid to us by a percentage royalty of the sales received by sonicstudio llc  plus a share of profits paid by sonicstudio llc 
we expect to have a interest in any future earnings 
foreign subsidiaries during the quarter ended june  we established a wholly owned subsidiary in japan  called sonic japan kk 
we transferred a total of employees into this new subsidiary 
the new subsidiary was established because of the increased level of business we have encountered in japan  to potentially lower our overall tax rate  and to increase our level of direct contact with important 
table of contents japanese customers  particularly those oem customers utilizing our consumer software products 
as part of this reorganization  we have begun reorganizing the distribution of our software products in japan 
in july  we notified easy systems japan or esj of our intention to terminate its distributorship of some of our software products  and are transitioning our business and customers 
while we believe that we have taken the necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition for esj s customers  we may not be able to maintain our relationship with these customers in the future or esj may not live up to its contractual obligations during the transition 
during the quarter ended september   we established a wholly owned subsidiary in china  called sonic solutions shanghai china  and hired a number of engineers to work for this new subsidiary 
we established this subsidiary in response to the growing demand for our cd dvd creation technology worldwide 
this new subsidiary allows us to tap into the large pool of engineering talent in china 
the subsidiary also brings additional reach to our operations which include development and sales offices in north america  europe  japan and taiwan 
other contingencies we are subject to various claims relating to products  technology  patent  shareholder and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses in these matters 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is determined after careful analysis of each matter  and is subject to adjustment if warranted 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from sonic solutions statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal years through years ended march  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses marketing and sales research and development general and administrative business integration total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended march   and net revenue 
our net revenue increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing an increase of  and increased to  in fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in sales  both from new and existing oem partners  of our consumer products which increased approximately

table of contents of fiscal and all of fiscal this increase was offset in part by a decrease in our professional audio and video sales of approximately 
the increase in net revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the increase in sales of our consumer products which increased approximately 
this increase was due to sales to new oem partners as well as to an increase in volume of sales reported by existing oem partners 
the increase in sales was also due to the full year inclusion of the results of oem licensing agreements that we assumed as part of our acquisition of the dmd business of veritas in december since the dmd business has now been integrated into our other operations  we are not able to specifically track results of its operations separately from our other consumer software business 
the increase in sales of our consumer products was offset in part by a decrease in our professional audio and video sales of approximately 
international sales accounted for million  or of our net revenue in fiscal year  million  or of our net revenue in fiscal year and million  or of our net revenue in fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
international sales have historically ranged from to slightly less than of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
the percentage decrease in fiscal year was due to the increase in domestic oem revenue from our consumer products 
the percentage increase in fiscal year was due to the increase in international sales of oem and development revenue from our consumer products 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal and in fiscal the decreases in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer products  including software license and development contracts  and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional audio and video systems 
cost of revenue mainly consists of third party licensing oem arrangements  employee salaries and benefits for personnel directly involved in the production of revenue generating products and amortization of acquired and internally developed software 
we capitalize a portion of our software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
this means that a portion of the costs we incur for software development are not recorded as an expense in the period in which they are actually incurred 
instead  they are recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded on our balance sheet is then amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products in which the software is included 
during fiscal year and  we capitalized approximately  and  respectively  and amortized approximately  and  respectively  excluding amounts capitalized and amortized relating to the daikin industries  ltd  ravisent  dmd and the interactual technologies  inc business acquisitions

significant customers 
revenue from two customers accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenue for the fiscal year three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of our total net revenue for fiscal year revenue recognized from these customers was pursuant to development and licensing agreements we have with them 
the loss of any one of these customers and our inability to obtain new customers to replace the lost revenue in a timely manner would harm our sales and results of operations 
gross profit 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal year to for fiscal year to for fiscal year the increase in our gross profit year over year was primarily due to a shift in sales product mix towards higher margin consumer products and to the reduction of hardware as a percentage of revenue in our professional audio and video systems

our general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and to  in fiscal these expenses represented of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and of net revenue in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal and primarily due to increased rent  insurance  professional and other general expenses related to the overall increase in our headcount from at march  to at march  to at march  we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our operations expand 
business integration expense 
business integration expenses primarily consisted of engineering consulting expenses per the consulting agreement we entered into with daikin dated february  in conjunction with the daikin acquisition completed in february fiscal year  we incurred expenses to transition the business to our management 
as such  these expenses did not exist during fiscal year and other income and expense  net

table of contents in addition to our operations  we utilized cash during the  and fiscal years to purchase new fixed assets  and to fund the development of capitalized software 
during the fiscal year  cash of  was used to complete the acquisition of the ravisent product line from axeda and  was used to complete the acquisition of the dmd business from veritas 
during the fiscal year  cash of  was used to complete the interactual technologies  inc acquisition 
on june   we announced a public offering of  shares of our common stock to institutional investors at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  the transaction was completed and the stock was issued to investors on july  we received net proceeds of approximately  after deducting placement agent fees and costs associated with the offering 
on september   we announced an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock to investors at a price of per share for gross proceeds of  the transaction was completed and the stock was issued to investors on september  we received net proceeds of approximately  after deducting underwriting discounts and costs associated with the offering 
on february   we filed a form s registration statement  as amended  with the securities and exchange commission to register our common stock  preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and preferred stock with an aggregate maximum offering price not to exceed million 
the registration statement has been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating and capital leases 
operating leases include our leased facilities and capital leases include leased equipment 
rent expense under operating leases was approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
future payments under operating and capital leases that have initial remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows in thousands total payments due by period more than years contractual obligations less than year years years operating leases capital leases total as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
such potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us in any required time frame and on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
see risk factors we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our shareholders equity and hare our business  results of operations and financial condition for more detailed information 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted securities and exchange commission rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 

table of contents risk factors you should consider carefully the risk factors set forth below as well as those in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing sonic 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair business operations 
the risks identified below could harm our business and cause the value of our shares to decline 
we cannot  however  estimate the likelihood that our shares may decline in value or the amount by which they may decline 
we may experience potential fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  face unpredictability of future revenue and incur losses in the future 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
we may not accurately forecast customer behavior and recognize or respond to emerging trends  changing preferences or competitive factors facing us  and  therefore  we may fail to make accurate financial forecasts 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors include fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products and the pcs with which our products are bundled  introduction of new products by us and our competitors  competitive pressures that result in pricing fluctuations  variations in the timing of orders and shipments of our products  changes in the mix of products sold and the impact on our gross margins  delays in our receipt of and cancellation of orders forecasted by customers  our ability to enter into or renew on favorable terms our licensing and distribution agreements  the costs associated with the defense of litigation and intellectual property claims  and general economic conditions specific to the dvd audio and video recording market  as well as related pc and consumer electronics markets 
although we were profitable for fiscal years and  you should not rely on the results for those periods as an indication of future performance 
in particular  given the general uncertainty of the speed and scope of the economic recovery and market trends for professional and consumer audio and video products  we may not remain cash flow positive or generate net income for fiscal moreover  our operating expenses are based on our current expectations of our future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
we tend to close a number of sales in the last month or last weeks of a quarter  especially in our professional audio and video business  and we generally do not know until quite late in a quarter whether our sales expectations for the quarter will be met 
for example  in recent quarters  as much as of our professional sales have been procured in the last month of the quarter 
because most of our quarterly operating expenses and our inventory purchasing are committed prior to quarter end  we have little ability to reduce expenses to compensate for reduced sales  and our operating results for that particular quarter may be adversely impacted 
if we have lower revenues than we expect  we may not be able to quickly reduce our spending in response 
we also may  from time to time  make certain pricing  service or marketing decisions that adversely affect our revenues in a given quarterly or annual period 
any shortfall in our revenues would have a direct impact on our operating results for a particular quarter and these fluctuations could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
failure to successfully integrate the interactual technologies business we recently acquired could negatively impact us 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the stock of interactual technologies for million in cash 
we completed the acquisition on february  and acquired all of 
table of contents interactual s assets and liabilities  including its portfolio of patents and patent applications  the interactual player  and all engineering and service operations 
former employees of interactual joined our company 
the interactual acquisition involves risks related to the integration and management of this business  which may be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our existing operations if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we may encounter substantial difficulties  costs and delays in integrating the interactual operations  including the following potential conflicts between business cultures  adverse changes in business focus perceived by third party constituencies  potential conflicts in distribution  marketing or other important relationships  an inability to implement uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  an inability to integrate our research and development and product development efforts  the loss of current or future key employees and or the diversion of management s attention from other ongoing business concerns  undiscovered and unknown problems  defects or other issues related to the interactual products that become known to us only some time after the acquisition  and negative reactions from our resellers and customers 
furthermore  interactual was a defendant in a lawsuit entitled trust licensing  llc and leigh rothschild v 
interactual technologies  inc in the united states district court for the southern district of florida civil action no 
in which it was charged with patent infringement and other wrongdoing 
as a result of a court sponsored mediation  interactual and the plaintiffs executed a settlement agreement on january   and interactual agreed to pay  to the plaintiffs   of this amount was paid in january however  after learning of our acquisition of interactual  the plaintiffs filed a motion to have the settlement set aside 
on may  we executed a final settlement agreement  in which we agreed to cancel the note payable of  and to pay an additional  which was paid on may  of the total purchase price of million paid in the interactual acquisition  an amount of  is being held in escrow for a period of one year to offset any resolution of unknown obligations or liabilities 
the additional settlement amount of  was paid from the escrowed amount 
any failure to successfully integrate the dmd business we purchased from veritas could negatively impact us 
the acquisition of the dmd business involves risks related to the integration and management of the dmd business  which will be a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our businesses if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
the process of integrating the dmd operations could cause an interruption or loss in momentum in our business and operating activities and  if material  could harm our business 
if we fail to integrate the dmd business into our existing operations  we may not achieve the desired synergies and benefits originally anticipated by the dmd acquisition  and as a result  we may not achieve a positive  long term benefit to our operation results 
in addition  our acquisition of the dmd business included the retention of approximately employees of veritas  representing approximately a increase in our total number of employees at that time 
consequently  we may face management and organizational issues as we continue to integrate the dmd business employees into our other operations 
because we have significant international operations and a significant portion of our revenue derives from sales made to foreign customers located primarily in europe and japan  we may be subject to political  economic and other conditions relating to our international operations that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our business 
we are dependent on sales to customers outside the united states  in particular europe and japan 
revenue derived from these customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
although most of our revenue and expenses are transacted in us 
table of contents dollars  we may be exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in the future as business practices evolve and we are forced to transact business in local currencies 
this may expose us to foreign currency fluctuation risks 
these foreign customers expose us to the following additional risks  among others currency movements in which the us dollar becomes significantly stronger with respect to foreign currencies  thereby reducing relative demand for our products outside the united states  import and export restrictions and duties  including tariffs and other barriers  foreign regulatory restrictions  for example  safety or radio emissions regulations  liquidity problems in various foreign markets  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
international sales historically represented slightly less than of our total sales  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant percentage of future revenue 
we also expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net product sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result  the occurrence of any negative international political  economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls 
these shortfalls could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to be harmed 
furthermore  we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
we may in the future choose to limit our exposure by the purchase of forward foreign exchange contracts or through similar hedging strategies 
however  no currency hedging strategy can fully protect against exchange related losses 
we may engage in future acquisitions that could dilute our shareholders equity and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our efforts to enhance our existing products and introduce new products  as well as grow our business and remain competitive  we have pursued  and we may pursue in the future  acquisitions of complementary companies  products and technologies 
we are unable to predict whether or when any other prospective acquisition will be completed 
we have limited experience in acquiring and integrating outside businesses 
the process of integrating an acquired business may produce operating difficulties  may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties  may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and expenditures and may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions  integrate acquired businesses into our current operations  or expand into new markets 
future acquisitions may not be well received by the investment community  which may cause our stock price to fall 
further  once integrated  acquisitions may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues  profitability or productivity or otherwise perform as expected 
the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities  our existing stockholders ownership could be significantly diluted 
if we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash  or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 
future acquisitions by us could result in the following  any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock issuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders percentages of ownership  
table of contents large one time write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  difficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired companies  contractual and intellectual property disputes  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we expect our product prices to decline  which could harm our operating results 
we expect prices for our oem products to decline due to competitive pricing pressures from other software providers  competition in the pc industry and oem customers possessing strong negotiating positions 
we may incur additional pricing pressures in other parts of our business 
these trends could make it more difficult for us to increase or maintain our revenue and may cause a decline in our gross and or operating profits  even if our sales in absolute dollars increase 
accordingly  our future success will depend in part on our ability to introduce new products and upgrades to our existing products with enhanced functionalities that can be sold at higher gross margins and or operating margins 
our reliance on a single supplier for our manufacturing makes us vulnerable to supplier operational problems 
our hardware outsourcing manufacturing program commits responsibility for almost all of our manufacturing activities to a single supplier arrow bell electronics 
furthermore  there are other significant risks associated with outsourcing our manufacturing processes 
for example  if arrow bell electronics does not achieve the necessary product delivery schedules  yields and hardware product reliability  our customer relationships could suffer  which could ultimately lead to a loss of sales of our products and have a negative effect on our gross margins and results of operations 
also  outsourcing our manufacturing processes increases our exposure to potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
the occurrence of any of the above noted product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products and may adversely impact our operating results 
we are dependent on third party single source suppliers for components of some of our products and any failure by them to deliver these components could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand 
we often use components in our products that are available from only a single source 
these components include phillip s video scaler and various xilinx devices 
we purchase these sole source components from time to time  that is  we do not carry significant inventories of these components and we have no guaranteed supply agreements for them 
we have experienced shortages of some sole sourced components in the past 
we are likely to experience similar shortages at some point in the future 
such shortages  as well as any pricing fluctuations on these sole source components  can have a significant negative impact on our business 
any interruption in the operations of our vendors of sole source components could adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from our current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays or reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and expose us to potential damages that may arise from our inability to supply our customers with products 
further  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components could harm our gross margin or operating results 

table of contents approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year derived from revenue recognized on development and licensing agreements from three customers 
during fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from revenue recognized on development and licensing agreements from three customers 
we anticipate that these relationships will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
any changes in our relationships with any of these three customers  including any actual or alleged breach of the agreements by either party or the early termination of  or any other material change in  any of the agreements would seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  a decrease or interruption in any of the above mentioned businesses or their demand for our products or a delay in our development agreements with any one of them could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
also  we may not succeed in attracting new customers as many of our potential customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors 
to attract new customers  we may be faced with intense price competition  which may affect our gross margins 
because a large portion of our net revenue is from oem customers  the potential success of our products is tied to the success of their product sales 
much of our consumer revenue is derived from sales through oem customers  including for example dell  hewlett packard  sony  matrox and avid 
the revenue from many of these customers is recognized on a sell through basis 
temporary fluctuations in the pricing and availability of the oem customers products could negatively impact sales of our products  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  increased sales of our consumer products to oems depend in large part on consumer acceptance and purchase of dvd players  dvd recorders and other digital media devices marketed by our oem customers in pcs or on a stand alone basis 
consumer acceptance of these digital media devices depend significantly on the price and ease of use for these devices 
if alternative technology emerges or if the demand for moving  managing and storing digital content is less than expected  the growth of this market may decline which may adversely affect sales of our consumer products to our oem customers 
in addition  some of the materials  components and or software included in the end products sold by our oem customers  who also incorporate our products  are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
supply disruptions  shortages or termination of any of these sources could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations due to the delay or discontinuance of orders for our products by our oem customers until those necessary materials  components or software are available for their end products 
moreover  if oem customers do not ship as many units as forecasted or if there is a general decrease in their unit sales  our net revenue will be adversely impacted and we may be less profitable than forecasted or unprofitable 
furthermore  we are dependent on reports prepared by the oem customers to determine the results of our sales of products through these oem customers 
if the oem customers prepare inaccurate or substandard sales reports  we may be required to take corrective actions  including auditing current and prior reports 
such corrective action may result in negative effects on us  including that our prior reported net revenue and related results may be inaccurate  in particular less than previously reported 
changes in requirements or business models of our oem customers may negatively affect our financial results 
oem customers can be quite demanding  in terms of the features they demand in software products they bundle  in terms of their quality and testing requirements  and in terms of their economic demands 
because there is a relatively small number of significant oem customers  if they demand reduced prices for our products  we may not be in a position to refuse such demands  in which case our revenues and our results of operations will be negatively affected 
if particular oems demand certain product or product features that we are unable to deliver  or if they impose higher quality requirements than we are in a position to satisfy  our revenues and our results of 
table of contents operations could be negatively affected 
also  if our competitors offer our oem customers more favorable terms than we do or if our competitors are able to take advantage of their existing relationships with these oems  then these oems may not include our software with their pcs 
these oem relationships serve an important role in distributing our software to the end user and positioning the market for upgrades to our more fully featured software products 
if we are unable to maintain or expand our relationships with oems  our business will suffer 
we have embarked on a new program with one of our major oems  dell  in which we are developing a number of versions of our products specifically for that oem s customers 
the versions include a base version to be included with the oem s products  and enhanced versions 
the enhanced versions will be marketed by the oem s sales force and by us to obtain favorable end user upgrade decisions at the point of sale  that is the time and place at which end user customers purchase a pc or other device  as well as after the point of sale 
if the oem offers an upgrade  then the base version can be sold by them to their customers without royalty to us 
we will be contributing significant resources to this effort including extra development resources to develop the various product versions required by the program  enhanced first line customer support activities  and enhanced marketing obligations  among others 
while we believe that upgrade rates and resulting revenues  which will be split between the oem and ourselves  will more than compensate for the lack of royalty revenues deriving from shipments of the base versions of our products and for our increased resource commitment  thereby increasing our overall revenues and contribution deriving from this oem  the new business model is untested at this time  and actual results may be disappointing 
in that case  our revenues and our results of operations could be negatively affected 
during the quarter ending december  dell began this transition and during the quarter ended march   they continued to transition our products into this new model 
if the transition and adjustment process takes a significant length of time  or encounters difficulties  the results of our operations in those quarters could be negatively affected 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  we may not be able to market our products successfully 
unlicensed copying and use of our intellectual property or illegal infringements of our intellectual property rights represent losses of revenue to our company 
our products are based in large part on proprietary technology which we have sought to protect with patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
for example  we have many patents and we have also filed applications for additional patents 
we also registered trademarks for the following dvdit  mydvd  dvd creator  dvd fusion  recordnow  backup mypc  cineplayer  authorscript  reeldvd and primo sdk among others 
in addition  we make extensive use of trade secrets that we may not be able to protect 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products may be manufactured  marketed or sold 
moreover  despite our efforts  these measures can only provide limited protection 
unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property 
to the extent that we use patents to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain needed patents or  if granted  the patents may be held invalid or otherwise indefensible 
patent protection throughout the world is generally established on a country by country basis 
failure to obtain patents or failure to enforce those patents that are obtained may result in a loss of revenue to us 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology adequately  if there are changes in applicable laws that are adverse to our interests  or if we become involved in litigation relating to our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology or relating to the intellectual property rights of others  our business could be seriously harmed because the value ascribed to our intellectual property could diminish and result in a lower stock price 
to the extent we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  competitors also may enter the market offering products identical to ours  with a negative impact on sales of our products 

table of contents other companies intellectual property rights may interfere with our current or future product development and sales 
we have never conducted a comprehensive patent search relating to the technology we use in our products 
there may be issued or pending patents owned by third parties that relate to our products 
if so  we could incur substantial costs defending against patent infringement claims or we could even be blocked from selling our products 
other companies may succeed in obtaining valid patents covering one or more of the key techniques we utilize in our products 
if so  we may be forced to obtain required licenses or implement alternative non infringing approaches 
our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  such as dvd rom  dvd video  dvd audio and mpeg video 
a number of companies and organizations hold various patents that claim to cover various aspects of dvd and mpeg technology 
we have entered into license agreements with certain companies and organizations relative to some of these technologies 
for instance  we have entered into license agreements with dolby licensing corporation covering dolby digital audio  with meridian audio limited covering meridian lossless packing  with mpeg la see below covering various aspects of mpeg video compression technology  and with thomson fraunhofer covering various aspects of mpeg and layer audio compression technology  among others 
such license agreements may not be sufficient to grant all of the intellectual property rights to us necessary to market our products 
we may become involved in costly and time consuming patent litigation 
we face risks associated with our patent position  including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents  the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied  the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products may infringe patent rights of third parties 
budgetary concerns may cause us not to file  or continue  litigation against known infringers of our patent rights 
failure to reliably enforce our patent rights against infringers may make licensing more difficult 
third parties could pursue us claiming that our products infringe various patents 
for example  a group of companies have formed an organization called mpeg la to enforce the rights of holders of patents covering aspects of mpeg video technology 
although we have entered into an agreement with mpeg la  that agreement may not prevent third parties not represented by mpeg la from asserting that we infringe a patent covering some aspects of mpeg technology 
patent infringement litigation can be time consuming and costly  may divert management resources and may result in the invalidation of our intellectual property rights 
if such litigation resulted in an unfavorable outcome for us  we could be subject to substantial damage claims and requirements to cease production of infringing products  terminate our use of infringing technology or develop non infringing technology and obtain a royalty or license agreement to continue using the technology at issue 
such royalty or license agreements might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all  resulting in serious harm to our business 
our use of protected technology may result in liability that threatens our continuing operation 
we may be liable to some of our customers for damages that they incur in connection with intellectual property claims 
although we attempt to limit our exposure to liability arising from infringement of third party intellectual property rights in our license agreements with customers  we may not succeed 
if we are required to pay damages to our customers  or indemnify our customers for damages they incur  our business could be harmed 
moreover  even if a particular claim falls outside of our indemnity or warranty obligations to our customers  our customers 
table of contents may be entitled to additional contractual remedies against us 
furthermore  even if we are not liable to our customers  our customers may attempt to pass on to us the cost of any license fees or damages owed to third parties by reducing the amounts they pay for our products 
these price reductions could harm our business 
because a significant percentage of our professional dvd products operate only on macintosh computers  the potential success of these products is tied to the success of this platform 
several of our current professional dvd products  including dvd creator and dvd fusion  operate on macintosh computers manufactured by apple computer 
if the supply of macintosh computers becomes limited  sales of these products will likely decline 
if there is a decrease in the use of the macintosh computing platform in the professional and corporate audio and video markets  there will likely be a decrease in demand for our products 
if there are changes in the operating system or architecture of the macintosh  it is likely that we will incur significant costs to adapt our products to the changes 
our macintosh users generally demand that we maintain compatibility with the latest models of the macintosh and the macintosh os 
currently our dvd creator and dvd fusion applications run only on os macintosh os x currently offers a compatibility mode which supports os x compatible applications  but we believe that we will soon have to modify our dvd creator and dvd fusion applications for them to continue to be able to run with the latest macintosh models 
such a modification may be difficult to accomplish or infeasible and if it proves to be lengthy  our revenues could be significantly reduced in the interim 
some of our competitors possess greater technological and financial resources than we do  may produce better or more cost effective products than ours and may be more effective than we are in marketing and promoting their products 
there is a substantial risk that competing companies will produce better or more cost effective products  or will be better equipped than we are to promote them in the marketplace 
a number of companies have announced or are delivering products which compete with our products 
these include ahead software  apple computer  cyberlink  intervideo  inc  mediostream  pinnacle  roxio and ulead 
some of these companies have greater financial and technological resources than we do 
for example  in april  apple computer announced the acquisition of the dvd authoring business of astarte gmbh 
prior to the acquisition  astarte sold a dvd authoring system that competed primarily with our dvd fusion product 
in january  apple announced two new dvd authoring products  which we presume are based on astarte s technology 
the first product  idvd  is intended for consumer users and competes with mydvd and dvdit the second product  dvd studio pro  is intended for professional users  and competes with dvdit pe  dvd fusion and reeldvd 
apple also announced the availability of aggressively priced dvd recorders with certain models of their macintosh personal computer 
in mid  apple purchased spruce technologies  a long standing competitor of ours in the professional dvd market 
in apple introduced dvd studio pro version which we presume is based  at least in part  on technology deriving from the spruce acquisition 
because our products are designed to adhere to industry standards  to the extent that we cannot distinguish our products from those produced by our competitors  our current distributors and customers may choose alternate producers or choose to purchase products from multiple vendors 
we may be unable to effectively compete with the other vendors if we cannot produce products more quickly or at lower cost than our competitors 
we cannot provide any assurance that the industry standards on which we develop new products will allow us to compete effectively with companies having greater financial and technological resources than we do to market  promote and exploit sales opportunities as they arise in the future 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could 
table of contents adversely affect our operating results 
further  any new products we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner or in advance of our competitors and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues 
we may encounter significant challenges as our business model evolves to depend more on sales of consumer products 
we anticipate that our business model will continue to evolve to depend more on sales of consumer products to generate additional revenue and grow our business 
if this trend continues  we will be subject to risks due to changing consumer demands  extensive competition which may result in price erosions  products liability litigation and product warranty concerns 
as our consumer segment grows  our business may become more seasonal 
the general pattern associated with consumer products that we develop is one of higher sales and revenue during the holiday season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  we may expect that the corresponding fiscal quarter will contribute a greater proportion of our sales and gross profit for an entire year 
if  for any reason  our sales or sales of our oem customers were to fall below our expectations in november and december  such as because specific events cause consumer confidence to drop or other factors limit consumer spending  our business  financial condition and annual operating results may be materially adversely affected 
success in our consumer segment will depend upon our ability to enhance and distinguish our existing products  to introduce new competitive products with features that meet changing consumer requirements  and to control our inventory levels to avoid any significant impact from sudden price decreases 
moreover  our success will depend on our ability to effectively sell our products in the consumer market 
currently  a significant portion of sales of our consumer products are through bundling arrangements with our oem customers 
however  as we increase our penetration of the consumer market  we must modify our current business models for oem arrangements to better monetize the end user relationships we derive from our oems 
we may need to increase the sales of our products through our web stores  specialized channels and bricks and mortar channels 
we may not have the capital required or the necessary personnel or expertise to develop and enhance these distribution channels 
if we do spend the capital required to develop these distribution channels  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful or profitable 
moreover  some of these other revenue opportunities are more fragmented than the oem market and will take more time and effort to penetrate 
also  some of our competitors  including for example apple  have well established retail distribution capabilities and existing brands with market acceptance that would provide them with a significant competitive advantage 
if we are not successful in overcoming any of the above challenges our business and results of operations may be harmed 
we may need to develop additional channels to market and sell our professional products  which may not occur 
the vast majority of sales for our professional products are through dealers 
recruiting and maintaining dealers can be a difficult process 
because our products are sophisticated  our dealers need to be technically proficient and very familiar with our products 
we may fail to attract the dealers necessary to expand our sales and business reversals or turnovers at dealer organizations may have a negative impact on our sales 
moreover  the attractive dealers in a targeted region may also carry competing products 
if our competitors offer our dealers more favorable terms  they may de emphasize or decline to carry our products 
if sources of financing are not available  we may not have sufficient cash to satisfy working capital requirements 
we believe that our current cash balances are sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing at that time or prior to that time if our plans change or if we expend cash sooner than anticipated 
currently we do not have any commitments from 
table of contents third parties to provide additional capital 
the risk to us is that at the time we will need cash  financing from other sources may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our failure to obtain financing could result in our insolvency and the loss to investors of their entire investment in our common stock 
we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to remain competitive 
the markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and relatively short product life 
the pursuit of necessary technological advances and the development of new products require substantial time and expense 
to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate  we must develop and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability 
for example  our business involves new digital audio and video formats  such as dvd video and dvd audio  and  more recently  the new recordable dvd formats including dvd ram  dvd r rw  and dvd rw 
we expend significant time and effort to develop new products in compliance with these new formats 
if these formats prove to be unsuccessful or are not accepted for any reason  there will be only limited demand for our products 
there is no assurance that the products we are currently developing or intend to develop will achieve feasibility or that even if we are successful  the developed product will be accepted by the market 
we may not be able to recover the costs of existing and future product developments and our failure to do so may materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our reliance on outsourcing our web store makes us vulnerable to third party s operational problems 
we have initiated a web based retail store for our consumer products including dvdit and mydvd  as well as some of our professional products  for example  reeldvd 
we currently outsource our web store targeted at the us market through an arrangement we have with digital river  targeted at the european market through an arrangement with element and targeted at the japanese market through an arrangement with sanshin 
we may have other similar arrangements in the future 
we refer to digital river and such other organizations as outsourcers 
under these arrangements the outsourcers provide the servers which list our products and handle all purchase transactions through their secure web sites 
we are dependent on the outsourcers for smooth operation of our web store 
recently digital river announced that it has acquired element since our web store sales constitute a significant portion of our revenue  any interruption of digital river s or any other outsourcer s service to us could have a negative effect on our business 
if digital river or other outsourcers were to withdraw from this business  or change its terms of service in ways that were not feasible for us  there might not be a ready alternative outsourcing organization available to us  and we might be unprepared to assume operation of the web store ourselves 
in any of these cases  our results of operations would be negatively affected 
undetected errors or failures found in our products may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance  which could seriously harm our reputation and business 
our products may contain undetected software errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
despite testing by us  errors may not be found in new products until after delivery to our customers 
we may need to significantly modify our products to correct these errors 
our reputation and business could be adversely affected if undetected errors cause our user and customer base to reject our new products 
our executive officers and key personnel are critical to our business  and because there is significant competition for personnel in our industry  we may not be able to attract and retain such qualified personnel 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team  and our technical  marketing  sales  and customer support and product development personnel 
the loss of significant numbers of such personnel could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any life insurance or other insurance covering the loss of any 
table of contents of our key employees 
because our products are specialized and complex  our success depends upon our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  including qualified technical  marketing and sales personnel 
however  the competition for personnel is intense and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel 
our ability to expand our operations will suffer if we fail to manage our growth effectively 
our success depends on our ability to effectively manage the growth of our operations 
as a result of our acquisitions  we have significantly increased our headcount from at march   to at march  to at march  also  we expect to increase the scope of our operations in the future both domestically and internationally 
furthermore  as a result of our acquisitions and the establishment of foreign subsidiaries  we have increased our geographical presence 
our management team will face challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over larger geographic distances  including the need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls as well as hire additional qualified personnel 
the inability to manage successfully the geographically more diverse and substantially larger organization  or any significant delay in implementing appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs for the larger organization  could have a material adverse effect on the growth of our business 
our stock price has been volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and could decline substantially 
the price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
the price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for any of the following reasons future announcements concerning us or our competitors  quarterly variations in operating results  charges  amortization and other financial effects relating to our recent or future acquisitions  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisition or loss of significant customers  distributors or suppliers  business acquisitions or divestitures  changes in earnings estimates by us or by independent analysts who cover the company  issuances of stock under our current or any future shelf registration statement  fluctuations in the us or world economy or general market conditions  or the delay in delivery to market or acceptance of new dvd products  such as dvd recorders 
in addition  stock markets in general  and the market for technology stocks in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years which have frequently been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our stock may fluctuate significantly in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
in the past  shareholders of various companies have often instituted securities class action litigation after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a shareholder files a securities class action suit against us  we would incur substantial legal fees and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 

table of contents new laws and regulations affecting corporate governance may impede our ability to retain and attract board members and executive officers  and increase the costs associated with being a public company 
on july   president george w 
bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the new act is designed to enhance corporate responsibility through new corporate governance and disclosure obligations  increase auditor independence  and tougher penalties for securities fraud 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq have adopted rules in furtherance of the act 
this act and the related new rules and regulations will likely have the effect of increasing the complexity and cost of our company s corporate governance and the time our executive officers spend on such issues  and may increase the risk of personal liability for our board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other executives involved in our company s corporate governance process 
as a result  it may become more difficult for us to attract and retain board members and executive officers involved in the corporate governance process 
in addition  in order to meet the new corporate governance and disclosure obligations  we have been taking  and will continue to take  steps to improve our controls and procedures and related corporate governance policies and procedures to address compliance issues and correct any deficiencies that we may discover 
consequently  we have experienced  and we anticipate continuing to experience  increased costs associated with such activities and  more generally  with being a public company  including additional professional and independent auditor fees 
if proposed accounting regulations that require companies to expense stock options are adopted  our earnings will decrease and our stock price may decline 
a number of publicly traded companies have recently announced that they will begin expensing stock option grants to employees 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board  in march  issued an exposure draft that  if adopted  will require companies to expense the fair value of stock options on the grant date 
currently  we generally only disclose such expenses on a pro forma basis in the noted to our annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
if accounting standards are changed to require us to expense stock options  our reported earnings will decrease significantly and our stock price could decline 
we are vulnerable to earthquakes  labor issues and other unexpected events 
our corporate headquarters  as well as the majority of our research and development activities  are located in california  an area known for seismic activity 
an earthquake  or other significant natural disaster  could result in an interruption in our business 
our business may also be impacted by labor issues related to our operations and or those of our suppliers  distributors or customers 
such an interruption could harm our operating results 
we are not likely to have sufficient insurance to compensate for any losses that we may sustain as a result of any natural disasters or other unexpected events
