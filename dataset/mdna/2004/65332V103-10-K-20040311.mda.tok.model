related party transactions 
motorola 
we have a number of important strategic and commercial relationships with motorola 
motorola is the sole provider of the iden infrastructure equipment and all of the handsets used throughout our network  except the blackberry devices  which are manufactured by rim 
as discussed 
table of contents above  we also work closely with motorola to improve existing products and develop new technologies and enhancements to existing technologies for use in our network 
we also rely on motorola for network maintenance and enhancement 
see e 
our network and technology 
in july  we acquired all of motorola s mhz smr licenses in the continental united states in exchange for million shares of our class a common stock and million shares of our nonvoting class b common stock 
as of february   motorola owned million shares of our class a common stock and million shares of our nonvoting class b common stock  all of which can be converted into shares of class a common stock at motorola s election  representing about of our class a common stock assuming that conversion 
in addition  under the terms of the agreement relating to that acquisition  motorola has the right to nominate two persons for election as members of our board of directors  but is not currently exercising this right 
nextel partners 
nextel partners provides digital wireless communications services under the nextel brand name in mid sized and tertiary us markets 
nextel partners has the right to operate in of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the united states ranked by population 
in january  we entered into agreements with nextel partners and other parties  including motorola  relating to the formation  capitalization  governance  financing and operation of nextel partners 
in those transactions in  we sold assets and transferred specified fcc licenses to nextel partners in exchange for equity interests in nextel partners having a total agreed value of million and cash of million  which also included the reimbursement of costs and net operating expenses 
as a result of nextel partners initial public offering in february  our equity interest was converted into voting class b common stock and our total ownership interest was diluted 
as a result of the initial public offering and subsequent transactions  we owned about of the outstanding common stock of nextel partners as of december  in november  nextel partners redeemed its nonvoting mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that we held for million 
at december   our investment in nextel partners was recorded at zero  as our share of nextel partners losses exceeded the book value of our investment 
we entered into the relationships with nextel partners principally to accelerate the build out of our network outside the largest metropolitan market areas that initially were the main focus of our network coverage 
as an inducement to obtain nextel partners commitment to undertake and complete the anticipated network expansion  we agreed that we would not offer wireless communications services under the nextel brand name  iden services on mhz frequencies  or wireless communications services that allow interconnect with landline telecommunications in nextel partners territory 
we also have roaming agreements with nextel partners covering all of the us market areas in which nextel partners currently provides  or will in the future provide  iden based services 
the certificate of incorporation of nextel partners establishes circumstances in which we will have the right or obligation to purchase the outstanding shares of class a common stock of nextel partners at specified prices 
we may pay the consideration of any such purchase in cash  shares of our class a common stock  or a combination of both 
subject to various limitations and conditions  including possible deferrals by nextel partners  we will have the right to purchase the outstanding shares of nextel partners class a common stock on january  subject to various limitations and conditions  we may be required to purchase the outstanding shares of nextel partners class a common stock if i we elect to cease using iden technology on a nationwide basis  ii this technology change means that nextel partners cannot offer nationwide roaming comparable to that available to its subscribers before our change  and iii we elect not to pay for the equipment necessary to permit nextel partners to make a technology change  
table of contents we elect to terminate the relationship with nextel partners because of its breach of the operating agreements  we experience a change of control  we breach the operating agreements  or nextel partners fails to implement changes required by us to match changes we have made in our business  operations or systems 
if we purchase the outstanding shares of nextel partners class a common stock as a result of the termination of our operating agreements with nextel partners as a result of our breach  the purchase price could involve a premium based on a pricing formula 
as a result of the termination of our operating agreements as a result of breach by nextel partners  the purchase price could involve a discount based on a pricing formula 
as a result of the election of a majority of the non nextel stockholders to require us to purchase  after nextel partners failure to implement changes in business  operations or systems required by us  the purchase price will be an amount equal to the higher of the fair market value as determined by the appraisal process and a rate of return on each tranche of invested capital in nextel partners  whether contributed in cash or in kind  from the date of its contribution through the purchase date  which value will be divided over all of nextel partners capital stock 
for any other reason  the purchase price will be the fair market value of the class a common stock 
under the certificate of incorporation of nextel partners  fair market value is defined as the price that a buyer would be willing to pay for all of nextel partners outstanding capital stock in an arm s length transaction and includes a control premium  as determined by an appraisal process 
we may not transfer our interest in nextel partners to a third party before january   and nextel partners class a common stockholders have the right  and in specified instances the obligation  to participate in any sale of our interest 
as of december   timothy m 
donahue  a member of our board of directors and our president and chief executive officer  and dennis m 
weibling  a member of our board of directors  each were directors of nextel partners 
nii holdings 
nii holdings provides wireless communications services using iden technology primarily in selected latin american markets 
in november  nii holdings  which prior to that time was our substantially wholly owned subsidiary  completed its reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  having filed a voluntary petition for reorganization in may in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware  after it and one of its subsidiaries defaulted on credit and vendor finance facilities 
under the plan of reorganization  we received million shares of nii holdings new class a common stock in settlement of claims held by us 
in addition  as part of the plan of reorganization  we contributed about million in cash and received in exchange about million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of nii holdings senior secured notes and million additional shares of nii holdings class a common stock 
as part of the reorganization  we also provided nii holdings with an additional million in connection with a us mexico cross border spectrum sharing arrangement between them and us 
in november  we sold million shares of nii holdings common stock  which generated million in net proceeds and a gain of million 
as of december   we owned about of the outstanding common stock of nii holdings 
in february  we tendered the notes to nii holdings in exchange for million in cash representing a tender price of  for each  in principal amount at maturity of the tendered notes 
mr 
donahue was a director of nii holdings until march

k 
regulation we are an smr licensee regulated by the fcc 
the fcc also regulates the licensing  construction  operation and acquisition of all other wireless telecommunications systems in the united states  including cellular and pcs operators 
smr regulations have undergone significant changes during the last decade  and we now are generally subject to the same fcc rules and regulations as cellular and pcs operators  known collectively with smr operators as commercial mobile radio service  or cmrs  providers 
within the limitations of available spectrum and technology  smr operators are authorized by the fcc to provide mobile communications services  including mobile telephone  two way radio dispatch referred to as walkie talkie  paging and mobile data and internet services 
we use iden technology developed and manufactured by motorola to deliver these services 
unlike some other digital transmission technologies  iden can be deployed on non contiguous frequency holdings  which benefits us because our mhz channel holdings are non contiguous 
in addition to being subject to fcc regulation  we are subject to certain state requirements 
the communications act of  as amended  preempts state and local regulation of the entry of  or the rates charged by  any cmrs provider  but it permits states to regulate the other terms and conditions of cmrs 
the fcc has not clearly defined what is meant by the other terms and conditions of cmrs  but has upheld the legality of states assessing universal service payment requirements on cmrs carriers 
the fcc also has held that most private lawsuits based on state law claims concerning how wireless rates are promoted or disclosed are not preempted by the communications act 
state and local governments are permitted to manage public rights of way and can require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers for use of those rights of way so long as the compensation required is publicly disclosed by the government 
the siting of cell sites and base stations also remains subject to state and local jurisdiction 
states also may impose competitively neutral requirements that  among other things  are necessary for universal service or to defray the costs of state e services programs  to protect the public safety and welfare  and to safeguard the rights of customers 
licensing 
although we currently hold an average of about mhz of spectrum in the  and mhz bands in our geographic markets  we primarily utilize mhz  and to a lesser extent mhz  spectrum to provide service to our customers 
the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our cmrs business and spectrum holdings 
fcc requirements impose operating and other restrictions on our business that increase our costs 
the fcc does not currently regulate cmrs rates  and states are legally preempted from regulating cmrs rates and entry 
the communications act and fcc rules also require the fcc s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an fcc license although new rules adopted late last year permit spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses  including our licenses  with minimal fcc oversight 
approval from the federal trade commission and the department of justice  as well as state or local regulatory authorities  may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum interests 
we hold several kinds of licenses to deploy mhz smr channels in digital mode within specified geographic areas 
because smr spectrum was originally licensed in small groups of channels  we hold 
table of contents thousands of these licenses  which together allow us to provide coverage across much of the continental us our  and mhz licenses are subject to requirements that we meet population coverage benchmarks tied to the initial license grant dates 
to date  we have met all of the construction milestones applicable to our licenses except in the case of licenses that are not material to our business 
our and mhz licenses have a year term and our mhz licenses have a year term  at the end of which each must be renewed 
the fcc allows renewal expectancies  which are presumptions that the licenses will be renewed to any  or mhz licensee that has provided substantial service during its past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and with the communications act 
in some cases we use common carrier point to point microwave facilities to connect the transmitter  receiver and signaling equipment for cell sites to the main switching office 
the fcc licenses these facilities separately and they are subject to regulation as to technical parameters and service requirements 
our business also is subject to certain federal aviation administration regulations governing the location  lighting  and construction of transmitter towers and antennas and may be subject to regulation under federal environmental laws and the fcc s environmental regulations 
state or local zoning and land use regulations also apply to our activities 
proposed public safety spectrum realignment 
in recent years  a number of public safety communications systems operating on high site systems in the mhz block of spectrum have experienced interference that is believed to be a result of the low site operations of cmrs providers in adjacent frequencies 
in november  we filed a proposal with the fcc that would result in a more efficient use of spectrum through the realignment of spectrum licenses and spectrum allocations in the  and mhz bands and  thereby  resolve many of these interference problems 
in march  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to consider proposals to solve the public safety interference issue 
during the course of the fcc s proceedings  a coalition of private wireless industry associations  public safety associations and we initiated discussions relating to the proposed  and mhz spectrum realignment to attempt to present a consensus plan to the fcc for its consideration 
in august  we  together with a number of parties that  together with us  represent over of the mhz licensees affected by the proposed realignment  filed a consensus plan with the fcc 
if adopted by the fcc  the proposal would establish separate channel blocks for low site cellular and commercial smr licensees from the channel blocks used by high site public safety and private wireless licensees  which in conjunction with proposed technical requirements  would virtually eliminate interference to the non cellular licenses 
under the proposal  we would maintain our net spectrum allocation  although we would exchange all of our spectrum in the and mhz bands and an average of mhz in the mhz band in our markets for mhz of contiguous spectrum in the mhz band and mhz of contiguous spectrum in the ghz band 
in december  we and the other proponents of the consensus plan filed a supplement to that plan relating to the funding of certain relocation costs associated with the spectrum realignment 
under our funding proposal  if the fcc approves the consensus plan as submitted  we would contribute up to million over the next several years primarily towards the cost of public safety relocation 
in november  we notified the fcc that  to satisfy our relocation commitment under the plan  we would deposit million in cash in an escrow account to be available to pay relocation costs  and would secure the remaining million commitment through one or more irrevocable stand by letters of credit issued by internationally recognized commercial lending institutions 
the letters of credit would provide payments for relocation costs should we fail to meet our funding obligations under the plan 
the million commitment does not include our own relocation costs that we would incur over several years if the consensus plan were approved 
the amount of such costs is not readily estimatable because of the numerous factors on which they are dependent  but they could be significant in certain circumstances 
in addition to seeking comment on both the initial and revised consensus plan  the fcc also invited the submission of additional proposals that could solve the public safety interference problem 
the fcc 
table of contents has received several alternative proposals 
in may  a group of large utility companies  cellular competitors of nextel and small smr providers filed an alternative proposal to the consensus plan  proposing to solve ongoing public safety interference through best practices and technical measures among mhz licensees  with no realignment of the spectrum bands 
we and the other consensus plan members do not believe that any of the alternative proposals adequately address the interference problems and therefore  we have opposed all alternative proposals to the consensus plan 
opponents of the consensus plan including  in particular  a number of our competitors  have also objected to its implementation on the grounds that the spectrum reallocation provisions of the consensus plan would disproportionately benefit nextel 
we and the other proponents of the consensus plan have opposed these objections on the grounds that they are based solely on the objecting parties commercial interests and do nothing to address the public safety interference problem 
consistent with this approach  verizon wireless has recently requested in filings with the fcc that the fcc withhold approval of the consensus plan and auction the ghz spectrum that would be issued to us pursuant to the consensus plan 
verizon wireless also has separately asserted that the fcc should defer its consideration of the consensus plan in light of reports that the staff of the united states department of justice has requested certain information from us and others  including verizon wireless  related to wireless communications services that incorporate walkie talkie features and related technologies 
while we are cooperating fully with that information request  we do not believe that it is relevant to the public safety system interference issues that are intended to be addressed by the consensus plan 
the consensus plan proposal  as well as the alternative proposals  continue to remain pending at the fcc  and could be impacted by other fcc actions  including the allocation of replacement spectrum under the consensus plan described below 
see new spectrum opportunities  spectrum auctions  and next generation wireless services 
we cannot predict whether  or under what terms  the fcc would approve the proposed realignment plan  and there is no assurance that the fcc will adopt any realignment plan 
although we are currently working with the public safety community on a case by case basis to solve interference problems as they are reported  absent fcc action  we may not be able to solve future problems without reducing the efficiency of our network or restricting service to our customers 
in addition  while the public safety community is aware of the potential network problems their personnel may experience  we cannot be certain that we or the wireless industry in general may not be subject to litigation should a situation arise in which damage or harm occurs as a result of commercial interference with a public safety communications network 
new spectrum opportunities  spectrum auctions  and next generation wireless services 
in february  the fcc concluded its auction of mhz of spectrum in the mhz band  also referred to as the guard band 
in two mhz guard band auctions  we paid about million for licenses 
each license is for mhz of spectrum 
these fcc licenses are issued for a period of years and are subject to unique operational requirements  including eligibility and use restrictions  as well as interference protection requirements that generally will preclude their use for cmrs 
additionally  there are fcc restrictions on the amount of spectrum in this band that we can use 
as part of the mhz spectrum realignment proposal discussed above  nextel  as one of a coalition of parties  has proposed to contribute its mhz spectrum to the fcc for reallocation for public safety use  and we would receive replacement spectrum 
thus  the long term use of our mhz spectrum is dependent upon the outcome of the mhz realignment proceeding 
in the event we retain these licenses  we plan to meet all requirements necessary to secure their retention and renewal 
in february  the fcc conducted an auction that included major trading area smr licenses in the mhz band in various parts of the country 
we were the high bidder on licenses  with a net total high bid of about million 
in november  the fcc allocated mhz of spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands that can be used for third generation  or g  wireless services 
in november  the fcc adopted the service rules for g wireless services in the and mhz bands  including provisions for application  licensing  operating and technical rules  and for competitive bidding 

table of contents licensees in these bands will be provided with the flexibility to provide any fixed or mobile service that is consistent with the allocations for this spectrum which will include both localized and regional geographic service areas 
the auction for this spectrum has not yet been scheduled 
in january  the fcc reallocated mhz of spectrum that was previously reserved primarily for federal government uses to a variety of non federal government uses  including private and commercial fixed and mobile operations 
these reallocations could provide opportunities to acquire additional spectrum that could be used for advanced wireless services 
in february  the fcc proposed a flexible licensing  technical and operating framework  as well as competitive bidding and interference standards for the mhz of reallocated spectrum 
generally  this spectrum is encumbered by existing governmental or commercial users  and there are substantial unresolved transitional issues related to the relocation of these incumbents 
in april  the fcc auctioned one nationwide mhz license in the mhz band  but we did not participate 
in january  the fcc reallocated mhz of spectrum from the ghz mobile satellite service  or mss  including the mhz band  to fixed and mobile terrestrial services 
the reallocated spectrum includes mhz originally identified as replacement spectrum under the consensus plan 
it is unclear how and to what extent this reallocation will affect the consensus plan 
the satellite industry filed petitions for reconsideration of the fcc s reallocation decision 
a rulemaking proceeding also was initiated to identify how the mhz of reallocated spectrum can be used and how it will be assigned for wireless services 
comments and reply comments were filed in april in november  the fcc released its third report and order and third memorandum opinion and order responding to these petitions and modifying its rules that mss licensees are to follow when relocating incumbent broadcast auxiliary service licensees in the mhz band and fixed service microwave licensees in the mhz band and petitions for reconsideration have been filed 
in february  the fcc commenced a rulemaking proceeding seeking comment on the relocation of the multipoint distribution service  or mds 
in that proceeding  the fcc addressed relocation issues for the mds channels in the mhz band and found that mds incumbents would be entitled to comparable facilities and or adequate replacement spectrum 
in april  the fcc proposed a comprehensive overhaul of certain wireless spectrum  including mds and multichannel multipoint distribution service  or mmds  the spectrum that we successfully bid to acquire from worldcom and nucentrix 
the fcc has proposed to substantially change its rules governing services in the mmds band and to provide additional flexibility to make it potentially available for advanced wireless services  certain aspects of which we support 
these proceedings remain pending 
we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any of the other spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to us or the wireless industry in the future 
spectrum caps and secondary spectrum markets 
prior to  the fcc imposed specified limits  known as spectrum caps  on the amount of spectrum that a single licensee may hold in a market 
these limits have largely been eliminated 
although there is no longer a specified limit on the amount of spectrum a single licensee may hold in a market  the fcc has retained a rural market cross ownership restriction and will continue to evaluate  on a case by case basis  spectrum aggregation caused by cmrs carriers mergers and acquisitions to determine whether a particular transaction will result in too much concentration in the affected wireless markets 
it is not clear what procedures the fcc will use to evaluate commercial wireless transactions 
in october  the fcc released new rules that provide additional flexibility for licensees to engage in various forms of spectrum leasing arrangements 
the fcc released for comment a further notice of proposed rulemaking  which proposed additional steps the fcc could take to further facilitate the growth of secondary markets for spectrum  including whether to extend flexible leasing policies to additional spectrum  including to public safety spectrum 
it is not known whether any spectrum initiatives adopted by the fcc will facilitate secondary markets for spectrum trading or leasing 

table of contents the fcc has initiated a number of spectrum related inquiries and proposed rulemaking proceeding 
the fcc has a task force to recommend changes in spectrum policy to increase spectrum efficiency  which task force is considering interference issues  use of unlicensed spectrum by frequency agile radios and spectrum swaps 
the fcc continues to make spectrum available for use by unlicensed devices  including wifi devices 
as recently as june  the fcc made available mhz of spectrum in the ghz band 
services 
pursuant to a fcc order  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide e services to their customers 
phase i e  which we began deploying in  requires wireless carriers to transmit both a the caller s telephone number and b the location of the transmitter and receiver site from which the call is being made to the designated public safety answering point  or psap  which is the dispatch center 
phase ii e requires the transmission of more accurate location information to the psap 
pursuant to an october fcc order  we launched phase ii service in october by deploying phase ii service to our first psap and by beginning the sale and activation of handsets equipped with a gps capabilities 
in addition to selling a gps capable handsets  phase ii e requires that we deploy the infrastructure  facilities and interconnectivity necessary to enable the transmission of latitude and longitude information from the a gps handset to a psap 
successful transmission of this location information to a psap requires substantial cooperation with the local exchange carrier and the psap  as well as third party database providers  all of which must have the necessary infrastructure and compatible software in place to connect with our network 
because our phase ii e services can be accessed only with an a gps capable handset  the fcc also required that a certain percentage of our new handset activations be a gps capable pursuant to interim benchmarks between january  and december   when we are required to have of our total subscriber base using a gps capable handsets 
we anticipate that  by the end of the first quarter  substantially all of the handsets that we offer new subscribers  other than the blackberry  will be a gps capable 
the vast majority of handsets currently in use by our existing subscribers  however  are not a gps capable 
we may incur significant additional costs in order to satisfy the phase ii e requirement  particularly if our rate of churn remains low  because our compliance requires that of our non a gps capable handsets in our subscriber base be replaced with a gps capable handsets 
the amount of such costs is highly dependent on both the number of new subscribers added to our network who purchase a gps capable handsets and the number of existing subscribers who upgrade from non gps capable handsets to a gps capable handsets 
motorola is our sole supplier for all of our handsets except the blackberry and we are dependent on motorola to provide a gps capable handsets in sufficient quantities 
nonetheless  the fcc appears to have held us responsible for meeting the phase ii deadlines  even in the event motorola is unable to produce the necessary handsets and infrastructure on a timely basis 
truth in billing and consumer protection 
the fcc s truth in billing rules generally require cmrs licensees such as us to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their wireless bills  display a toll free phone number to call for billing questions  and identify any third party service providers whose charges appear on the bill 
in addition  over twenty states have commenced inquiries to examine the billing and advertising practices of certain nationwide wireless carriers and we have been requested to provide  and we have provided  information relating to billing and advertising practices in some of these proceedings 
the california public utilities commission has proposed extensive consumer protection and privacy regulations for all telecommunications carriers  and service quality standards and reporting requirements for wireless carriers  that could significantly increase the cost of providing wireless service in california 
in addition  federal legislation has been proposed that calls for a wireless subscriber bill of rights  which  if 
table of contents enacted  could significantly increase the cost to us and other wireless providers of providing wireless services  and would  among other things  authorize the fcc to monitor cell phone service quality 
hearing aid compatibility 
the communications act requires telecommunications carriers  such as us  and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  such as motorola  to make their products and services accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities to the extent these measures are readily achievable 
pursuant to this mandate  we and motorola are continuing to develop and market a variety of products and services to facilitate access to our wireless network by persons with disabilities 
if the fcc requires the wireless industry to improve accessibility on a unilateral basis by redesigning digital phones  motorola has advised us that the requirements may not be technologically feasible and that any related technical changes to the iden handset could add significantly to its cost of production 
in august  the fcc released an order modifying the statutory exemption for wireless phones from hearing aid compatibility requirements under the hearing aid compatibility act of and establishing compatibility rules for wireless service providers and handset manufacturers 
as a result  wireless manufacturers and service providers will be required to make digital wireless phones accessible to a greater number of hearing aid users 
we  together with motorola  our primary handset supplier  are participating in various industry efforts to arrive at an acceptable solution to help meet the policy goals of the fcc in this arena 
any such solution could result in significant costs to us 
motor vehicle restrictions 
a number of states and localities have banned or are considering banning or restricting the use of wireless phones while driving a motor vehicle 
new york and new jersey have enacted statewide bans on handheld phone use while operating a motor vehicle  and the district of columbia city council has passed a similar ban 
similar legislation is pending in other states 
several localities also have enacted ordinances banning or restricting the use of handheld wireless phones by drivers 
such bans could cause a decline in the number of minutes of use by subscribers 
local number portability 
in november  wireless providers launched telephone number portability in the nation s top markets 
portability enables customers to keep their telephone numbers when they change carriers within established geographic markets 
we have implemented the operational and technical changes necessary to facilitate porting in and out of our network 
given the interdependence of other carrier operations and processes required to effectuate a port  the wireless number portability process was initially subject to certain errors  and ports required more time to complete than had been predicted 
the wireless industry since has greatly improved the porting process and continues to work cooperatively to further reduce the time required to complete most ports 
electronic surveillance 
in  congress enacted the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea  which requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to upgrade their networks to provide certain surveillance capabilities to law enforcement agencies 
we have signed two cooperative agreements with the federal bureau of investigation  or fbi  to meet the surveillance needs of law enforcement agencies 
the agreements essentially validate our surveillance software solutions  arrange for the deployment of the solutions in our networks  and provide for some cost recovery associated with their deployment 
we have already installed and deployed the requisite surveillance capabilities in our interconnect and digital dispatch networks and are now calea compliant with respect to traditional voice communications 
in september  the fcc issued a public notice governing the calea compliance deadlines for the additional calea requirements applicable to carriers  such as us  that operate packet mode communications networks 
having received several extensions from the fbi  we are working with our primary equipment vendor  motorola  to design and implement a packet mode surveillance solution 
cost recovery for developing  installing and deploying this solution will depend to a large extent on the government s and industry s interpretation of calea requirements and the publication of safe harbor compliance standards 
voice over internet protocol 
in february  the fcc initiated a rulemaking proceeding to examine the appropriate regulatory treatment for voice services provided using internet protocol  or voip  
table of contents services 
the growth of voip service and their currently unregulated status is causing concern as carriers  including wireless carriers  begin to migrate their networks towards internet protocol  or ip  platforms and can flexibly deliver a range of service applications to consumers 
the notice of proposed rulemaking recognizes that internet services should continue to be subject to minimal regulation but will examine the means by which social polices supported by regulation  such as the universal service fund  can be maintained 
in connection with this proceeding  the fcc will initiate a separate calea rulemaking proceeding to address the technical issues associated with law enforcement access to voip 
the result of this rulemaking proceeding could significantly affect compensation among carriers for interconnection to their networks 
health concerns 
fcc rules limit the permissible human exposure to radio frequency radiation from wireless transmission equipment 
studies have been undertaken to determine whether certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health problems  including cancer  and whether wireless handsets may also interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
a study in italy affirmatively linked mobile phone radiation to cancer growth  although the national cancer institute has cautioned that these and similar studies have limitations  given the relatively short amount of time cellular phones have been widely available 
various other studies  however  have found no evidence that cell phones cause cancer 
in january  for instance  a british government advisory panel released a report indicating that mobile phones and base stations do not pose health risks to citizens  but urged particular caution for children 
additional studies of radio frequency emissions are ongoing  and the ultimate findings of these studies will not be known until they are completed and made public 
class action lawsuits are also pending against several wireless carriers  including us  and manufacturers to force wireless carriers to supply hands free devices with phones and to compensate customers who have purchased radiation reducing devices 
see item legal proceedings 
concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets  which would decrease demand for our services 
miscellaneous federal regulations 
each of the following existing and potential regulatory obligations could increase the costs of our  and our competitors  operations 
certain incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  in rural areas have started to impose on wireless carriers  including us  charges to terminate traffic that we send to them 
these new charges  imposed via state tariffs  feature high termination rates that are not based on the rural ilecs cost of terminating the traffic we send to them  and they are not reciprocal 
the rural ilecs generally justify these tariffs as a legitimate means of recovering their costs for transport and termination of wireless traffic 
in september  we  along with other wireless carriers  filed a petition with the fcc to have these tariffs declared unlawful 
in addition  several rural ilecs  in conjunction with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs  have initiated state proceedings seeking to require cmrs carriers to pay access type charges for local traffic that originates on a cmrs carrier s network  travels over a rboc s network and terminates on a rural ilec s network 
if any of these commissions rule in the rural ilecs favor  cmrs carrier interconnection costs in those markets  including ours  could increase 
under the fcc s rules  wireless providers are potentially eligible to receive universal service subsidies  however  they are also required to contribute to both federal and state universal service funds 
the rules adopted by the fcc in its universal service orders require telecommunications carriers generally subject to limited exemptions to fund existing universal service programs for high cost carriers and low income customers and to fund new universal service programs to support services to schools  libraries and rural health care providers 
in  the fcc initiated two universal service proceedings relevant to all telecommunications providers  including us one concerns what services universal service funds can be used to support  and the other addresses how universal service mandatory contributions from customers are assessed and recovered by carriers 
regardless of our ability to receive universal service funding for the supported services we provide  we are required to fund these federal programs based on our interstate end user telecommunications revenue and we also are required to contribute to some state universal service programs 

table of contents in december  the fcc released an order that included a restriction on the amount that carriers can include on a customer s bill to recover their costs of contributing to the universal service fund 
in january  we filed a petition for reconsideration of  among other things  the new restrictions on our ability to recover our costs for contributing to universal service 
the outcome of this proceeding could substantially alter the manner by which the fcc calculates carrier contributions to the federal fund  and could increase our mandatory contribution to the federal universal service fund  as well as those of other wireless carriers 
this proceeding remains pending 
the issue of wireless subscriber privacy  particularly relating to location tracking  has been implicated in some of the fcc s wireless proceedings  including those relating to its e and calea mandates 
the fcc has adopted rules limiting the use of customer proprietary network information by telecommunications carriers  including us  in marketing a broad range of telecommunications and other services to their customers and the customers of affiliated companies 
in july  the fcc clarified its privacy rules governing carriers use  disclosure and safeguarding of customer proprietary network information  or cpni 
most significantly  the fcc prohibited carriers from disclosing cpni to unrelated third parties or carrier affiliates that do not provide communications related services  unless they first obtain their customers express consent 
in addition  the fcc has concluded that a customer must give express consent before the carrier can use or disclose call location information concerning the user of a cmrs service obtained in connection with a customer s use of wireless services  except in specified emergencies or if mandated by the court 
in december  the president signed into law new legislation the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of  or can spam act that includes provisions relating to wireless spam 
these provisions generally bar the sending of any commercial electronic mail messages without affording a commercial e mail message recipient the chance to opt out of future commercial email messages 
moreover  it requires the fcc  in consultation with the federal trade commission  to develop rules that would provide mobile phone users with greater control over commercial messages sent to their mobile phones 
it is unclear whether wireless carriers will be responsible for monitoring and policing all commercial email messages sent to a subscriber s handset 
in september  the fcc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding telemarketing practices seeking comment on the extent to which telemarketing to wireless consumers exists today  and asking whether consumers receive solicitations on their wireless phones  and  if so  the nature and frequency of such solicitations 
the fcc will reexamine the scope of implied consumer consent to telemarketing solicitation  which could affect some of our marketing practices 
in june  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the procedures for review of tower site construction and construction of other communications facilities under the existing federal statutes and fcc rules 
the proposed rules may result in complicating the review process  as the siting approval process would require reviews by state governments  indian tribes  and interested third parties 
the fcc also is conducting an inquiry into the effect that communications towers may have on migratory birds 
l 
employees as of february   we had over  employees 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good

risk factors we have substantial indebtedness  which may limit how we conduct our business or limit our growth  which in turn could be a competitive disadvantage 
we currently have substantial indebtedness  which could affect the way in which we conduct our business  as follows a 
we have substantial indebtedness and long term obligations  which greatly exceed the total of our cash on hand and annual cash flow from operating activities 
as of december   we had  million of outstanding indebtedness  including  million of senior notes and  million of indebtedness under our secured bank credit facility  as well as million of capital lease and other financing obligations and million in mandatorily redeemable preferred stock obligations 
the schedule for the repayment of these outstanding obligations as of december  was as follows million for  million for  million for  million for  million for and  million after the level of our outstanding indebtedness greatly exceeds our cash on hand and our annual cash flows from operating activities 
at december   we had  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  and we had  million in revolving credit borrowings available under our secured credit facility  which availability declines over time  and the continued availability of which is subject to our satisfaction of various financial covenants and ratios set forth in the facility 
during  our operating activities provided  million of cash  and we used  million in investing ie  expansion and strategic acquisitions activities  and  during  our operating activities provided  million of cash  and we used  million in investing activities 
prior to that time  however  our operating activities did not provide sufficient cash flow to fund our investing activities 
unless our operating activities continue to generate sufficient cash  we will not be able to continue to expand our business and satisfy our long term obligations 
because required repayments of our outstanding obligations increase significantly in future years  unless our operating activities can generate significantly more cash in the future  we will have to decrease cash used for investing activities  refinance our debt or access the capital markets  or some combination thereof 
our ability to access the capital markets for additional funds may be limited by market conditions affecting the telecommunications industry in particular and the capital markets in general  the market s perception of our performance and assets  the potential commercial opportunities and risks associated with implementation of our business plan  the actual amount of cash we need to pursue our business strategy  the terms of the proposed financing arrangement  the terms of our existing financing agreements  including restrictive covenants  existing debt service requirements  and the terms of options and other convertible securities issued to others 
b 
our existing financing agreements contain covenants and financial tests that limit how we conduct business 
the indentures under which our senior notes have been issued and our secured bank credit facility contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to borrow money  grant additional liens on our assets  make particular types of investments or other restricted payments  sell assets or merge or 
table of contents consolidate 
these restrictions could limit or interfere with our ability to take advantage of various business opportunities or otherwise effectively compete by restricting our ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  including amounts available under our bank credit facility  or assume the indebtedness of parties that we may wish to acquire  make investments in or acquire other companies or businesses  pre pay or redeem any of our indebtedness  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of our business  and pay dividends and make other distributions 
our bank credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial tests 
if we are not able to meet these ratios and satisfy other tests  we will be in default of the bank credit facility  which in turn would result in defaults under our indentures  and would give our banks and note holders the right to require us to repay all amounts then outstanding  unless we were able to negotiate an amendment or waiver 
in the first quarter  we were able to amend the covenants under our bank credit facility to avert a likely covenant violation  but there is no assurance that we would be able to do so in the future 
borrowings under the bank credit facility are secured by liens on assets of substantially all of our subsidiaries 
c 
we have significant intangible assets  which may not be adequate to satisfy our obligations in the event of a liquidation 
if we default on debt or if we were liquidated  the value of our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations 
we have a significant amount of intangible assets  such as licenses granted by the fcc 
the value of these licenses will depend significantly upon the success of our business and the growth of the wireless communications and telecommunications industries in general 
we had a net tangible book value deficit of  million as of december  if we are not able to compete effectively in the highly competitive wireless communications industry  our future growth and operating results will suffer 
there are currently six national wireless communications services providers  including us 
our ability to compete effectively with these providers and other prospective wireless communications service providers depends on the factors below  among others 
a 
if our wireless communications technology does not perform in a manner that meets customer expectations  we will be unable to attract and retain customers 
customer acceptance of the services we offer is and will continue to be affected by technology based differences and by the operational performance and reliability of our network as compared to the networks of our competitors 
we may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers if we are unable to resolve quality issues related to our network as they arise or if those issues limit our ability to expand our network coverage or capacity as currently planned  or were to place us at a competitive disadvantage to other wireless service providers in our markets 
b 
we may be limited in our ability to grow unless we expand network capacity and coverage and address increased demands on our business systems and processes as needed 
our subscriber base continues to grow rapidly 
to continue to successfully increase our number of subscribers and pursue our business plan  we must economically expand the capacity and coverage of our network  potentially obtain additional spectrum in some or all of our markets  
table of contents secure sufficient transmitter and receiver sites at appropriate locations to meet planned system coverage and capacity targets  obtain adequate quantities of base radios and other system infrastructure equipment  and obtain an adequate volume and mix of handsets and related accessories to meet subscriber demand 
if we are unable to achieve the increased network capacity benefits of the voice coder  or there are substantial delays in doing so  we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs and otherwise may not be able to successfully increase our number of subscribers 
our operating performance and ability to retain these new customers may be adversely affected unless we are able to timely and efficiently meet the demands for our services and address any increased demands on our customer service  billing and other back office functions 
we have outsourced many aspects of our customer care function to third parties and cannot be sure that this outsourcing will not heighten these risks 
c 
some of our competitors are financially stronger than we are  which may limit our ability to compete based on price 
because of their resources and  in some cases  ownership by larger companies  some of our competitors are financially stronger than we are  which may enable them to offer services to customers at prices that are below the prices at which we can offer comparable services 
if we cannot compete effectively based on the price of our service offerings  our revenues and growth may be adversely affected 
d 
we may face continuing pressure to reduce prices  which could adversely affect operating results 
over time  as the intensity of competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we and our competitors have decreased prices or increased service and product offerings  resulting in declining average monthly revenue per subscriber in the wireless industry overall  which may continue 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact customer retention  and these trends could be exacerbated by the fcc s recently enacted wireless number portability rules that reduce the barriers to customer movements between carriers 
to the extent we continue to offer more competitive pricing packages  our average monthly revenue per subscriber may continue to decrease  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
if this trend continues  it may be increasingly difficult for us to remain competitive 
we may encounter further market pressures to continue to migrate existing customers to lower priced service offering packages  restructure our service offering packages to offer more value  reduce our service offering prices  or respond to particular short term  market specific situations  such as special introductory pricing or particular new product or service offerings  in a particular market 
e 
several of our competitors now provide or plan to provide two way walkie talkie services  and if those service become comparable to ours  we would lose a competitive advantage 
one of the primary ways in which we differentiate ourselves is through our two way walkie talkie services  marketed as nextel nationwide direct connect 
until the latter half of  traditional cellular or personal communication services providers did not offer walkie talkie services 
a number of wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  have begun to offer  or announced plans to offer  wireless equipment that is capable of providing walkie talkie services that are designed to compete with our nationwide direct connect services 
in  several of our competitors introduced  or announced plans to introduce  these walkie talkie services 
if these walkie talkie services are perceived to be or become  or if 
table of contents any such services introduced in the future are  comparable to our nationwide direct connect walkie talkie service  our competitive advantage would be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
f 
our digital handsets are more expensive than those of some competitors  which may affect our growth and profitability 
with the exception of the blackberry  which is available only from rim  we currently market multi function digital handsets available from only one supplier  motorola 
the higher cost of these handsets  as compared to analog handsets and digital handsets that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability  may make it more difficult or less profitable for us to attract customers 
in addition  the higher cost of our handsets requires us to absorb part of the cost of offering handsets to new and existing customers 
these increased costs and handset subsidy expenses may reduce our growth and profitability 
g 
if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
our network uses non contiguous spectrum frequencies  which traditionally were only usable for two way radio calls  such as those used to dispatch taxis and delivery vehicles 
we became able to use these frequencies to provide a wireless telephone service competitive with cellular carriers only when motorola developed its proprietary iden technology 
we are currently the only national us wireless service provider utilizing iden technology  and iden handsets are not currently designed to roam onto other domestic wireless networks that utilize other technologies 
because iden technology is a proprietary technology that is not standards based  it is not as widely adopted as  and currently has fewer subscribers on a worldwide basis than  other wireless technologies 
accordingly  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
the wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
future technological advancements may enable other wireless technologies to equal or exceed our current levels of service and render iden technology obsolete 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose customers to our competitors 
in addition  competition among the differing wireless communications technologies could further segment the user markets  which could reduce the demand for  and competitiveness of  our technology  and reduce the resources devoted by third party suppliers  including motorola  which supplies all of our current iden technology  to developing or improving the technology for our systems 
h 
if our wireless data and internet services do not perform satisfactorily  our operations and growth could be adversely affected 
we offer our subscribers access to wireless data and internet services  marketed under the brand name nextel online 
unless these services perform satisfactorily  are utilized by a sufficient number of our subscribers and produce sufficient levels of customer satisfaction  our future results may be adversely affected 
because we have less spectrum than some of our competitors  and because we have elected to defer the deployment of any next generation technology  the wireless data and internet services that we currently offer are significantly limited compared to those services offered by some other wireless communications providers 
our wireless data and internet capabilities may not allow us to perform fulfillment and other customer support services more economically or to realize a source of future incremental revenue 
further  our wireless data and internet capabilities may not counter the effect of increasing competition in our markets 
table of contents and the related pricing pressure on basic wireless voice services or incrementally differentiate us from our competitors 
we also may not successfully realize our goals if we or third party developers fail to develop new applications for our customers  we are unable to offer these new services profitably  these new service offerings adversely affect the performance or reliability of our network  or we otherwise do not achieve a satisfactory level of customer acceptance and utilization of these services 
any resulting customer dissatisfaction  or failure to realize cost reductions or incremental revenue  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  growth prospects and perceived value 
i 
costs and other aspects of a future deployment of advanced digital technology could adversely affect our operations and growth 
if we were to deploy next generation digital technologies that would allow high capacity wireless voice and higher speed data transmission  significant capital requirements would be required  and could increase in the event of unforeseen delays  cost overruns  unanticipated expenses  regulatory changes  engineering design changes  network or systems compatibility  equipment unavailability and technological or other complications  such as our inability to successfully coordinate this change with our customer care  billing  order fulfillment and other back office operations 
as there are several types of next generation technologies that may not be fully compatible with each other or with other currently deployed digital technologies  if the type of technology that we were to choose to deploy does not gain widespread acceptance or perform as expected  our business may be adversely affected 
in addition to the costs associated with a change in technology  we could also incur specified obligations with respect to nextel partners if we elect to deploy new technologies  including the obligation to purchase the outstanding shares of nextel partners class a common stock at its then current fair value 
finally  there can be no guarantee that any such technology will provide the advantages that we expect 
j 
if our roaming partners experience financial or operational difficulties  our customers ability to roam onto their networks may be impaired  which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers who roam on those networks 
nextel partners operates a network compatible with ours in numerous mid sized and tertiary markets 
nii holdings also provides services to our customers through roaming agreements and a cross border spectrum sharing arrangement 
if nextel partners or nii holdings experiences financial or operational difficulties  the ability of our customers to roam on their networks may be impaired 
in that event  our ability to attract and retain customers who want to access nextel partners portion of the network or nii holdings network may be adversely affected 
in addition  in the event of termination of the cross border spectrum sharing arrangement  we may incur additional costs to replace the anticipated benefits from that arrangement 
we may not be able to obtain the spectrum necessary to implement new technologies or pursue our long term business plan 
we may seek to acquire additional or contiguous spectrum through negotiated purchases  in government sponsored auctions of spectrum or otherwise 
we cannot be sure in which auctions we would participate or whether we will be a successful bidder 
in addition  we cannot predict the outcome or terms of the spectrum realignment plan that we and others have proposed to the fcc in connection with the fcc s effort to address interference experienced by public safety communications systems  which plan could result in us obtaining additional contiguous spectrum 
certain next generation technologies that we may deploy in the future would require that we hold contiguous spectrum before those technologies could be deployed on our network  making it necessary for 
table of contents us to acquire contiguous spectrum before we could provide additional products or services to our customers or provide other benefits that can only be provided with these technologies 
we may not be able to accomplish any spectrum acquisition or obtain the additional capital necessary to acquire that spectrum 
if sufficient additional capital is not available  to the extent we are able to complete any spectrum acquisition  the amount of funding available to us for our existing business would be reduced 
even if we are able to acquire spectrum  we still may require additional capital to finance the pursuit of any new business opportunities associated with our acquisitions of additional spectrum  including those necessary to deploy new network technologies or support or provide next generation wireless services 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
government regulations determine how we operate  which could increase our costs and limit our growth and strategy plans 
the fcc regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed spectrum that is essential to our business 
future changes in regulation or legislation and congress and the fcc s continued allocation of additional spectrum for commercial mobile radio services  which include specialized mobile radio  cellular and personal communication services  could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations 
for example  compliance with regulations requiring us to provide public safety organizations with caller location information will materially increase our cost of doing business to the extent that we are unable to recover some or all of these costs from our customers 
further  if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we may be subject to sanctions  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
for example  while the communications act requires that we make products and services accessible to persons with disabilities  motorola has advised us that these requirements may not be technologically feasible 
these regulations also can have the effect of introducing additional competitive entrants to the already crowded wireless communications marketplace 
we are required by december  to have of our total subscriber base using a gps capable handsets 
we may incur significant additional costs in order to satisfy the phase ii e requirement because our compliance requires that the non a gps capable handsets in our subscriber base be replaced with a gps capable handsets 
the amount of the costs we would incur is highly dependent on both the number of new subscribers added to our network who purchase an a gps capable handset  and the number of existing subscribers who upgrade from non gps capable handsets to a gps capable handsets 
if our rate of churn remains low  unless substantial numbers of subscribers upgrade their handsets  we may have to incur significant costs to get a sufficient number of a gps capable handsets into our network 
it is possible that we may face additional regulatory prohibitions or limitations on our services 
for example  the california public utilities commission has proposed extensive consumer protection and privacy regulations for all telecommunications carriers 
if adopted  the rules will significantly alter our business practices in california with respect to nearly every aspect of the carrier customer relationship  including solicitations  marketing  activations  billing and customer care 
if these regulations are adopted in california as currently proposed  they would impose significant additional costs on us as well as other wireless carriers 
if any new regulations prohibit us from providing planned services  it could be more difficult for us to compete 
further  some state and local jurisdictions have adopted legislation that could affect our costs and operations in those areas 
for example  some jurisdictions  such as the states of new york and new jersey have laws restricting or prohibiting the use of portable communications devices while driving motor vehicles  and the district of columbia city council has passed a similar ban 
federal legislation has been proposed that would affect funding available to states that do not adopt similar legislation 
if similar laws are enacted in other jurisdictions  we may experience reduced subscriber usage and demand for our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents finally  we cannot be certain that we or the wireless industry in general may not be subject to litigation should a situation arise in which damage or harm occurs as a result of interference between a commercial licensee like us and a public safety licensee  such as a emergency operator 
we are susceptible to influence by motorola  whose interests may conflict with ours 
motorola holds a significant block of our outstanding stock and  as long as it owns or more of our outstanding shares of common stock  it has the right to nominate up to two people for election to our board of directors 
motorola and its affiliates engage in wireless communications businesses  and may in the future engage in additional businesses  and offer products  and may in the future offer additional products  all of which compete with some or all of the services we offer 
motorola is not currently exercising its right to designate board nominees 
if it were to do so  members of our board nominated by motorola would be able to influence the management of our business  which could create conflicts of interest 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements  our operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is currently our sole source for most of the network equipment and all of the handsets we offer except the blackberry accordingly  we must rely on motorola to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services we plan to offer to our customers 
in addition  because we are one of a limited number of wireless carriers that have deployed iden technology  we bear a substantially greater portion of the costs associated with the development of new equipment and features than would be the case if our network utilized a more widely adopted technology platform 
motorola has recently announced plans for the proposed spin off of its semiconductor unit and has made a number of changes in its senior management team 
if these or other factors affecting our relationship with motorola were to result in a significant adverse change in motorola s ability or willingness to provide handsets and related equipment and software applications  or to develop new technologies or features for us  or in motorola s ability or willingness to do so on a timely  cost effective basis  we may not be able to adequately service our existing subscribers or add new subscribers and may not be able to offer competitive services 
accordingly  a decision by motorola to discontinue manufacturing  supporting or enhancing our iden based infrastructure and handsets would have a material adverse effect on us 
motorola is also a significant supplier of wireless communications equipment to each of our competitors 
consequently  motorola may elect to focus a greater amount of its financial and other resources on the development of enhanced features functionality of standards based wireless equipment used by our competitors rather than the proprietary iden equipment due to the larger potential market for that equipment 
in such event  we would be materially adversely affected unless alternative sources are licensed by motorola to manufacture iden based equipment or we have the ability to transition to a different technology 
because iden technology is not as widely adopted and currently has fewer subscribers on a worldwide basis than other wireless technologies  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
we expect to continue to rely principally on motorola or its licensees for the manufacture of a substantial portion of the equipment necessary to construct  enhance and maintain our iden network and handset equipment at least for the next several years 
for instance  we rely on motorola to provide us with technology improvements designed to expand our wireless voice capacity and improve our services  such as the voice coder software upgrade  and the handset based a gps location technology solution necessary for us to comply with the fcc s e requirements 
the failure by motorola to deliver these improvements and solutions  or its inability to do so within our anticipated timeframe  could impose significant additional costs on us 
with respect to the fcc s e requirements  we are responsible for timely meeting these requirements  whether or not motorola is able to produce the necessary handsets and infrastructure 

table of contents agreements with motorola reduce our operational flexibility and may adversely affect our growth or operating results 
motorola provides the iden infrastructure equipment and substantially all of the handsets throughout our markets under agreements that set the prices we must pay to purchase and license this equipment  as well as a structure to develop new features and make long term improvements to our network 
in  the terms of the primary supply agreements for motorola handsets and the iden infrastructure expired 
we are in the process of renegotiating new long term supply agreements with motorola for the purchase of network infrastructure equipment and subscriber handsets  and currently are purchasing equipment and supplies from motorola under interim arrangements and purchase orders under economic terms substantially similar to those of the expired agreements 
certain of our agreements with motorola  including those that have expired  reduce our operational flexibility 
our arrangements with motorola  together with the fact that our existing customer base is utilizing iden technology  may delay or prevent us from employing new or different technologies that perform better or are available at a lower cost because of the additional economic costs and other impediments to change generally as well as those that arise under the motorola agreements 
for example  the recently expired agreements with motorola required us to provide motorola with notice of our determination that motorola s technology is no longer suited to our needs at least six months before publicly announcing or entering into a contract to purchase equipment utilizing an alternate technology 
in addition  those agreements provided that if motorola manufactured  or elected to manufacture  the equipment utilizing the alternate technology that we elect to deploy  we were required to give motorola the opportunity to supply of our infrastructure requirements for the alternate technology for three years 
to the extent that we are subject to these or similar obligations in the future  our ability to negotiate with or obtain an alternate equipment supplier may be limited 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
while the current lawsuits against us have been dismissed by the federal court  the plaintiffs have appealed  and we cannot be sure of the outcome or if additional lawsuits will not be filed 
we cannot be sure that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns 
our equity investment in nextel partners is subject to numerous limitations  conditions and covenants 
the certificate of incorporation of nextel partners sets forth various circumstances in which we will have the right or obligation to purchase the outstanding shares of class a common stock of nextel partners at specified prices 
in certain circumstances  the price at which we would be required to purchase such shares is based on pricing formulas that imply a premium or a specified rate of return 
we may pay the consideration of any such purchase in cash  shares of our class a common stock  or a combination of both 
we may need to obtain additional capital if we were to use cash to satisfy a significant portion of any purchase of nextel partners shares 
we could issue a significant number of shares of our class a common stock if we were to use our stock to satisfy a significant portion of any purchase of nextel partners shares  which could affect the market price of our stock 
we may not transfer our interest in nextel partners to a third party before january  
table of contents our issuance of additional shares of common stock and general conditions in the wireless communications industry may affect the price of our common stock 
we currently have arrangements in various forms  including options and convertible securities  under which we will issue a substantial number of new shares of our class a common stock 
as of december   we had commitments to issue million shares upon conversion of class b nonvoting common stock  million shares upon conversion of convertible senior notes and zero coupon convertible preferred stock and million shares upon exercise of options or in connection with other awards outstanding under our incentive and other equity plans 
all of these in the aggregate represent million shares  or of our class a common stock outstanding on december  assuming these shares issuable had been outstanding on that date 
an additional billion in aggregate dollar amount of shares of our class a common stock is available for issuance and sale under the direct stock purchase plan 
in addition  we may elect in some circumstances to issue equity to satisfy obligations otherwise payable in cash or to make acquisitions  and we have issued and may continue to issue common stock in exchange for some of our outstanding securities 
an increase in the number of shares of our common stock that are or will become available for sale in the public market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and  as a result  could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities 
some of the shares subject to issuance are  or may become  freely tradable  without regard to the volume limitations of rule under the securities act of our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs

item legal proceedings 
in april  a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the circuit court in baltimore  maryland by the law offices of peter angelos  and subsequently in other state courts in pennsylvania  new york and georgia by mr 
angelos and other firms  alleging that wireless telephones pose a health risk to users of those telephones and that the defendants failed to disclose these risks 
we  along with numerous other companies  were named as defendants in these cases 
the cases  together with a similar case filed earlier in louisiana state court  were ultimately transferred to federal court in baltimore  maryland 
on march   the court granted the defendants motions to dismiss 
the plaintiffs have appealed this decision 
a number of lawsuits have been filed against us in several state and federal courts around the united states  challenging the manner by which we recover the costs to us of federally mandated universal service  telecommunications relay service payment requirements imposed by the fcc  and the costs including costs to implement changes to our network to comply with federal regulatory requirements to provide e  telephone number pooling and telephone number portability 
in general  these plaintiffs claim that our rate structure that breaks out and assesses federal program cost recovery fees on monthly customer bills is misleading and unlawful 
the plaintiffs generally seek injunctive relief and damages on behalf of a class of customers  including a refund of amounts collected under these regulatory line item assessments 
we have reached a preliminary settlement with the plaintiff  who purports to represent a nationwide class of affected customers  in one lawsuit that challenges the manner by which we recover the costs to comply with federal regulatory requirements to provide e  telephone number pooling and telephone number portability 
the settlement  if found to be fair and finally approved by the court  would render moot a majority of these lawsuits  and would not have a material effect on our business or results of operations

nii holdings 
the information presented above that is derived from our consolidated financial statements includes the consolidated results of nii holdings through december  during  nii holdings recorded a non cash pre tax restructuring and impairment charge of  million in connection with its decision to discontinue funding one of its operating companies and the implementation of its revised business plan 
in november  nii holdings  which prior to that time had been our substantially wholly owned subsidiary  completed its reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
nii holdings filed a voluntary petition for reorganization in may in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware after it and one of its subsidiaries defaulted on credit and vendor finance facilities 
prior to its bankruptcy filing  nii holdings was accounted for as one of our consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of nii holdings bankruptcy filing in may  we began accounting for our investment in nii holdings using the equity method 
in accordance with the equity method  we did not recognize equity losses of nii holdings after may as we had already recognized  million of losses in excess of our investment in nii holdings through that date 
we have presented nii holdings net operating results through may as equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates  as permitted under the accounting rules governing a mid year change from consolidating a subsidiary to accounting for the investment using the equity method 
however  the presentation of nii holdings in the financial statements as a consolidated subsidiary in has not changed from prior presentation 
the following table provides the operating revenues and net loss of nii holdings included in our consolidated results for and prior periods  excluding the impact of intercompany eliminations in millions operating revenues net loss upon nii holdings emergence from bankruptcy in november  we recognized a non cash pre tax gain on deconsolidation of nii holdings in the amount of  million consisting primarily of the reversal of equity losses we had recorded in excess of our investment in nii holdings  partially offset by charges recorded when we consolidated nii holdings  including  among other items  million of cumulative foreign currency translation losses 
at the same time  we began accounting for our new ownership interest in nii holdings using the equity method  under which we recorded our proportionate share of nii holdings results of operations 
in november  we sold million shares of nii holdings common stock  which generated million in net proceeds and a gain of million 
we now account for the million shares of nii holdings common stock that we still hold as an available for sale cost method investment

prior to july   in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognized revenue from handset sales and an equal amount of the related cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the expected customer relationship period of years  beginning when title to the handset passed to the customer

can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
in january  we changed our handset revenue and related cost recognition policy in accordance with sab no 
under the prior method of accounting  we recognized revenues and the related cost of handset sales when title to the handset passed to the customer

in the first quarter  we incurred a one time cumulative non cash charge to the income tax provision of million to increase the valuation allowance related to our net operating losses 
this cumulative charge was required since we have significant deferred tax liabilities related to our fcc licenses that have a significantly lower tax basis than book basis

we used some of the proceeds from newly issued senior notes and a new term loan under the bank credit facility  together with our existing cash resources  to redeem and retire certain senior notes  then existing term loans under the facility and preferred stock 
these newly issued senior notes and the new term loan have lower interest rates and longer maturity periods than the notes and loans that were retired

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a 
overview company overview 
the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations 
historical results may not be indicative of future performance 
for a complete listing of all of our risk factors  please see part i  item business m 
risk factors and forward looking statements 
we are a leading provider of wireless communications services in the united states providing a comprehensive suite of advanced wireless services  including digital wireless mobile telephone service  our wireless walkie talkie service known as nextel direct connect and wireless data transmission services 
as of december   we provided service to about million subscribers  excluding subscribers who purchase pre paid services under our boost mobile brand 
for  we had billion in operating revenues and income available to common stockholders of billion 
we ended with over  employees 
our all digital packet data network is based on iden wireless technology provided by motorola 
we  together with nextel partners  currently utilize the iden technology to serve of the top us markets where about million people live or work 
nextel partners provides digital wireless communications services under the nextel brand name in mid sized and tertiary us markets  and has the right to operate in of the top metropolitan statistical areas in the united states ranked by population 
as of december   we owned about of the outstanding common stock of nextel partners 
in addition  as of december   we also owned about of the outstanding common stock of nii holdings  which provides wireless communications services primarily in selected latin american markets 
the fcc regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed spectrum that is essential to our business 
future changes in fcc regulation or congressional legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations 
management s summary 
our business strategy is to provide differentiated products and services in order to acquire and retain the most valuable customers in the wireless telecommunications industry 
our services include nationwide direct connect  the long range walkie talkie service that allows communication at the touch of one button  mobile telephone services including advanced digital features such as speakerphones  additional line service  conference calling  voice activated dialing for hands free operation  a voice recorder for calls and memos  advanced phonebook and datebook tools  and data services  including email  mobile messaging services and our nextel online services 
we offer a variety of handsets that support all of our services 
we believe that we also differentiate ourselves from our competition by focusing on the quality of our customer care  in large part through our customer touch point strategy designed to improve our customer relationship by focusing on eliminating 
table of contents situations that create customer dissatisfaction at each point where we interact with  or touch  our customers 
we believe that the wireless communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services offered and quality of service 
past and expected consolidation within the industry has created and will continue to create large  well capitalized competitors with substantial financial and other resources  increasing the level of competition 
although competitive pricing is often an important factor in potential customers purchase decisions  we believe that our targeted customer base of business users  government agencies and high value individuals who utilize premium mobile communications features and services are also likely to base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services that make it easier for them to get things done quickly and efficiently 
a number of our competitors have launched or announced plans to launch services that are designed to compete with direct connect 
although we do not believe that the current versions of these services compare favorably with our service in terms of latency  quality  reliability or ease of use  in the event that our competitors are able to provide walkie talkie service comparable to ours  one of our key competitive advantages would be reduced 
consequently  in an effort to continue to provide differentiated products and services that are attractive to this targeted customer base  and to enhance the quality of our service in  we plan to further extend the reach of direct connect service in north america and into selected markets in latin america  begin the deployment of an enhancement to our existing iden technology  known as widen  designed to increase the data speeds of our network by up to four times the current speeds  build an additional  transmitter and receiver sites to improve both our geographic coverage and to meet the capacity needs of our growing customer base  introduce handsets that  together with software that we recently installed in our network infrastructure  are designed to more efficiently utilize radio spectrum to significantly increase our network capacity once these handsets are in use  and complete a field trial of nextel wireless broadband  an easy to use and secure service that connects customers to the internet at broadband speeds  with the full mobility of wireless service 
we continually seek the appropriate balance between our cost to acquire a new customer and the lifetime value for that customer 
we focus our marketing efforts principally on identifying and targeting high value customers that recognize the value of our unique service offerings  and focus our advertising efforts on communicating the benefits of our services to those targeted groups 
in june  we announced that we had become the title sponsor of one of the most popular sports in the united states  the nascar premier national series  now known as the nascar nextel cup series  beginning with the nascar daytona in february in september  we introduced our new nextel 
done 
branding and related advertising initiatives  which focus attention on productivity  speed  and getting things done 
we are also exploring other markets and customers that have the potential to support future profitable growth in other markets 
in  we launched our boost mobile brand  which targets the youth and pre paid calling wireless markets  in test markets in california and nevada 
in  we plan to expand the boost mobile brand offering pre paid services in several additional markets 
our focus on offering innovative and differentiated services requires that we continue to invest in  evaluate and  if appropriate  deploy new services and enhancements to our existing services 
see part i  item business e 
our network and technology 
we have expended  and will continue to expend  significant amounts of capital on the development and evaluation of these services and enhancements 
in addition  we have acquired  and will continue to acquire  licenses for spectrum that we may use to deploy some of these new services and enhancements 
for instance  in  we agreed to purchase spectrum licenses from worldcom and nucentrix that we may use in connection with the deployment of certain broadband services 
the total purchase price for this spectrum is million  and we expect each of these transactions to close by the end of if we were to determine that any of these services  
table of contents enhancements or spectrum licenses will not provide sufficient returns to support continued investment of financial or other resources  we would have to write off the assets associated with them 
because the wireless communications industry continues to be highly competitive  particularly with regard to customer pricing plans  we are continually seeking new ways to create or improve capital and operating efficiencies in our business in order to maintain our operating margins 
we continue to experience savings from outsourcing arrangements entered into in prior years for significant portions of customer support and information technology 
in  we outsourced our cell site development functions to several vendors 
in  we also continued to expand our customer convenient  and cost efficient  distribution channels  primarily through the opening of over additional nextel stores  bringing our total to over stores at december  we continually seek to cost efficiently optimize the performance of our nationwide network  including through our planned introduction of handsets designed to more efficiently utilize radio spectrum and increase our network capacity 
if there are substantial delays in the deployment of these handsets  or if we are unable to deploy them  the related benefits would be delayed or reduced  and we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs 
see part i  business e 
our network and technology our technology plans 
we rely on motorola to provide us with handsets and infrastructure and software enhancements that are designed to improve the quality of our network 
motorola is and is expected to continue to be our sole source supplier of iden infrastructure and all of our handsets except the blackberry  which is manufactured by rim 
we also continue to focus on generating greater cash flow from operations  and  during  we continued to make significant progress in our effort to reduce our total debt 
during  we retired billion in long term debt and preferred stock and issued billion in new lower cost debt  resulting in net principal retirements of billion 
we may  from time to time  as we deem appropriate  enter into additional refinancing and similar transactions  including exchanges of our common stock or other securities for our debt obligations  and redemption  repurchase or retirement transactions that in the aggregate may be material 
we have agreed to contribute up to million over several years towards the cost of spectrum relocation of public safety and private wireless users as part of a proposed realignment of the spectrum in which we principally operate to resolve interference experienced by public safety communications systems 
this plan remains subject to fcc approval  but we have notified the fcc that  if the plan is approved  we will deposit million in cash in an escrow account to be available to pay these relocation costs  and will secure the remaining million commitment through one or more irrevocable stand by letters of credit  which would provide payments for relocation cost should we fail to meet our funding obligations under the plan

regulation proposed public safety spectrum realignment 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations  either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from handset and accessory sales 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for mobile telephone  nextel direct connect and other wireless services  variable charges for airtime and nextel direct connect usage in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers and activation fees 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
as a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month  we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not 
table of contents billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and historical minutes and represented less than of our operating revenues and less than of our accounts receivable balance in our estimates have been consistent with our actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
because we have well over one million accounts  it is not practical to review the collectibility of each account individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable each period 
therefore  we consider a number of factors in establishing the allowance for our portfolio of customers  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  agings of the accounts receivable portfolio and other factors 
when collection efforts on individual accounts have been exhausted  the account is written off by reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december  during  we experienced increased collections  an improvement in our accounts receivable agings  and a reduction in write offs 
as a result  our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was lower than it was at december  even though our total accounts receivable balance increased 
write offs in the future could be impacted by general economic and business conditions that are difficult to predict 
in addition  it is difficult to predict with certainty the impact that recent events  such as number portability  could have on our account write offs due to the fact that we have limited experience with actual results from the event 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets 
long lived assets such as property  plant  and equipment represented about  million of our  million in total assets as of december  we calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives of up to years for buildings  to years for network equipment and internal use software and to years for non network internal use software  office equipment and other assets 
the substantial majority of property  plant  and equipment represents our iden network equipment and software 
our iden nationwide network is highly complex and  due to constant innovation and enhancements  some network assets may lose their utility faster than anticipated 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives and salvage value of these assets and make adjustments to those estimates after considering historical experience and capacity requirements  consulting with the vendor  and assessing new product and market demands 
during  we recorded million or per common share of additional depreciation expense as a result of adjusting the useful lives of certain of our network assets in the first quarter while the remaining useful lives for iden network equipment and software represent our best estimate at this time  we recognize that at some point in the future we may migrate to a next generation technology  which could impact the lives of our iden network equipment and software 
as of december   we have million of costs associated with construction in progress activities and communication assets in warehouses not yet deployed into our network 
about of this amount represents costs for activities incurred in connection with the early phase of cell site construction 
such activities include  among others  engineering studies  design layout and zoning 
because we need to be able to respond quickly to business needs  we incur these costs well in advance of when the cell site asset is placed into service 
our current plan is to use all of these cell sites for expansion and quality improvements  future capacity demands and other strategic reasons  however  to the extent there are changes in economic conditions  technology or the regulatory environment  our plans could change and some of these assets could be abandoned and written off 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss  if any  is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  our views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of impairment losses  we group our domestic long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the domestic enterprise level  which for us is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are 
table of contents largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we did not perform an impairment analysis for our domestic long lived assets in any of the periods presented as there were no indicators of impairment  however  we may have to perform such analyses in the future to the extent there are changes in our industry  economic conditions  technology or the regulatory environment 
valuation and recoverability of intangible assets 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented about  million of our  million in total assets as of december  intangible assets with indefinite useful lives primarily consist of our fcc licenses 
we performed our annual impairment tests of fcc licenses as of october  and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair values of these intangible assets were greater than their carrying values 
using a residual value approach  we measured the fair value of our and mhz licenses in our national footprint by deducting the fair values of our net assets as well as the fair values of certain unrecorded identified intangible assets  other than these fcc licenses  from our reporting unit s  that is our company s  fair value  which was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the analysis was based on our long term cash flow projections  discounted at our corporate weighted average cost of capital 
the residual value approach yielded a value substantially in excess of the recorded balance of our and mhz licenses in and we have invested about million in mhz fcc licenses that are currently not used in our network 
we have agreed to exchange these licenses along with other licenses in our consensus plan proposal filed with the fcc 
if we do not exchange these licenses in the future  we have an alternative business plan for use of these licenses 
if the alternative business plan is not realized  some portion of or the entire recorded asset could become impaired 
recoverability of capitalized software 
as of december   we have about million in net unamortized costs for software that will be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed and or used in our network 
our current plans indicate that we will recover the value of the assets  however  to the extent there are changes in economic conditions  technology or the regulatory environment  or demand for the software  our plans could change and some or all of these assets could become impaired 
net operating loss valuation allowance 
as of december   we had about billion of consolidated net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
we have provided a full reserve against the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december  this reserve is established because we do not have a sufficient history of taxable income at this time to conclude that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
we reached this conclusion after reviewing our complete history of financial statement and tax net operating losses and our recent generation of earnings and taxable income 
we believe that our cumulative losses  when evaluated in connection with other qualitative factors and uncertainties concerning our business and industry  provide substantial negative evidence regarding the eventual realizability of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december   which outweighs any of the positive evidence available 
however  if current trends continue  it is possible that the results of our cumulative historical test will yield positive evidence that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefit of our net operating losses sometime in if that is the case  subject to review of other qualitative factors and uncertainties  we would expect to start reversing some or all of the remaining net operating loss valuation allowance into income as a credit to tax expense except for about million of the net operating loss valuation allowance associated with stock option transactions that will be reversed with a credit to stockholders equity 
significant new accounting pronouncements 
in november  the eitf issued a final consensus on eitf issue no 
 which provides guidance on when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 

table of contents previously  under the provisions of sab no 
 we accounted for the sale of our handsets and the subsequent service to the customer as a single unit of accounting due to the fact that our wireless service is essential to the functionality of our handsets 
accordingly  we recognized revenue from handset sales and an equal amount of cost of handset revenues over the expected customer relationship period  beginning when title to the handset passed to the customer 
under eitf issue no 
 we no longer need to consider whether a customer is able to realize utility from the handset in the absence of the undelivered service 
based on this fact and that we meet the criteria stipulated in eitf issue no 
 we have concluded that eitf issue no 
requires us to account for the sale of a handset as a unit of accounting separate from the subsequent service to the customer 
accordingly  for all arrangements entered into beginning in the third quarter  we recognize revenue from handset sales and the related cost of handset revenues when title to the handset passes to the customer 
in addition  we recognize the portion of the activation fees allocated to the handset unit of accounting in the statement of operations when title to the handset passes to the customer 
we defer the portion of the activation fees allocated to the service unit of accounting  together with an equal amount of costs  and recognize such deferred fees and costs on a straight line basis over the contract life in the statement of operations 
eitf issue no 
became effective prospectively for all arrangements entered into beginning in the third quarter in addition  as permitted  we elected to apply the provisions of eitf issue no 
to our existing customer arrangements  with any impact recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
accordingly  on july   we reduced our current assets and liabilities by about million and our non current assets and liabilities by about million  representing substantially all of the revenues and costs associated with the original sale of handsets that were deferred under sab no 
the cumulative effect of adopting eitf issue no 
did not materially impact our statement of operations 
b 
results of operations operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from handset and accessory sales 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for mobile telephone  nextel direct connect and other wireless services  variable charges for airtime and nextel direct connect usage in excess of plan minutes  long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers and activation fees 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we recognize revenue from handset and accessory sales when title passes to the customer 
cost of providing wireless service consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our network  primarily including direct switch and transmitter and receiver site costs  such as rent  utilities  property taxes and maintenance for the network switches and sites  payroll and facilities costs associated with our network engineering employees  frequency leasing costs and roaming fees paid to other carriers  fixed and variable interconnection costs  the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of transmitter and receiver sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site  and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for wireless calls terminating on their networks and fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of wireless calls  costs to operate our handset service and repair program  and the costs to activate service for new subscribers 

table of contents cost of handset and accessory revenues consists primarily of the cost of the handsets and accessories sold  order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage

an additional measurement we use to manage our business is the rate of customer churn  which is an indicator of customer retention and represents the monthly percentage of the customer base that disconnects from service 
the churn rate consists of both involuntary churn and voluntary churn 
involuntary churn occurs when we have taken action to disconnect the handset from service  usually due to lack of payment 
voluntary churn occurs when a customer elects to disconnect service 
customer churn is calculated by dividing the number of handsets disconnected from commercial service during the period by the average number of handsets in commercial service during the period 
we focus our efforts on retaining customers  and keeping our churn rate low  because the cost to acquire customers generally is higher than the cost to retain existing customers 
our average monthly customer churn rate during declined to about as compared to about during we believe that this decline in the churn rate is attributable to our ongoing focus on customer retention  acquiring high quality subscribers  including add on subscribers from existing customer accounts  and the attractiveness of our differentiated products and services 
we have implemented a customer touch point strategy designed to proactively identify and address major points of potential customer dissatisfaction over the customer life cycle 
these initiatives include such programs as strategic care provided to customers with certain attributes and efforts to migrate customers to more optimal service pricing plans 
the improvement in churn also reflects the strengthening of our credit policies and procedures and the completion of our integrated billing  customer care and collections system in  which allow us to better manage our customer relationships 
if general economic conditions worsen  if our products or services are not well received by prospective or existing customers  or if competitive conditions in the wireless telecommunications industry intensify  including  for example  as a result of the impact of actions taken by our competitors in response to the implementation of wireless number portability or the introduction of competitive services  particularly services that compete with our direct connect service  demand for our products and services may decline

cost of service increased from to  primarily due to increased minutes of use resulting from the combined effect of the increase in handsets in service and an increase in the average monthly minutes of use per handset 
specifically  we experienced a increase in costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of our network and fixed interconnection costs  and a increase in variable interconnection fees 
costs related to the operation and maintenance of our network and fixed interconnection fees increased million primarily due to an increase in costs to operate our handset service and repair program as a result of the growth in the subscriber base electing handset insurance and participating in service and repair programs  an increase in transmitter and receiver and switch related operational costs due to a increase in transmitter and receiver sites placed into service during  and an increase in roaming fees paid to nextel partners due to the increase in our customer base and the launch of nationwide direct connect service in these increased costs were partially offset by million of cost benefits consisting of a net benefit recorded in in connection with the towers leased from spectrasite holdings  inc tower lease payments  previously recorded as a reduction of financing obligation  are classified as tower rent expense in this tower rent expense was more than offset by the deferred gain amortization recorded in connection with the tower sale transaction with spectrasite  and a decrease in fixed interconnection costs as a result of initiatives implemented over the past year to gain efficiencies in our network by taking advantage of lower facility fees and more technologically advanced network equipment that provides for additional capacity but requires less leased facilities 
the increase in variable interconnection fees in was principally due to an increase in total system minutes of use  partially offset by a lower cost per minute of use 
total system minutes of use increased from to  principally due to a increase in the number of handsets in service  as well as a increase in the average monthly billable minutes of use per handset over the same period 
our lower variable interconnection cost per minute of use was primarily the result of rate savings achieved through efforts implemented beginning in the second quarter to move long distance traffic to lower cost carriers 
we expect the aggregate amount of cost of service to increase as customer usage of our network increases and as we add more sites  switches and other equipment to expand the coverage and capacity of our network 
however  we expect the cost per minute of use in to decline as compared to due to improvements in network operating efficiencies

in addition  we pay some indirect dealers and distributors residuals to encourage ongoing customer support and to promote handset sales to high value customers who are more likely to generate higher monthly service revenues and less likely to deactivate service 
the increase in dealer commissions is primarily attributable to higher commissions earned by dealers on activations of higher priced handsets beginning in the second quarter as of december   these higher commissions paid to dealers have substantially offset the impact of the revenues from the higher priced handsets 
the remaining increase is primarily related to increasing dealer residuals along with increasing dealer commissions designed to motivate the activation of new handsets and sales of data applications 
the increase in sales and marketing payroll and related expenses is primarily associated with additional employees hired for our nextel stores

future capital needs and resources capital resources 
as of december   our capital resources included billion of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and billion of the revolving loan commitment under our credit facility  as discussed below  resulting in a total amount of liquidity to fund our operating  investing and financing activities of billion as of december  our ongoing capital needs depend on a variety of factors  including the extent to which we are able to fund the cash needs of our business from operating activities 
prior to the third quarter  we were unable to fund our capital expenditures  spectrum acquisition costs and business acquisitions with the cash generated by our operating activities 
therefore  prior to that time  we met the cash needs of our business principally by raising capital from issuances of debt and equity securities 
to the extent we continue to generate sufficient cash flow from our operating activities to fund these investing activities  we will use less of our available liquidity and will have less of a need to raise additional capital from the capital markets to fund these types of expenditures 
if  however  our cash flow from operating activities declines  we may be required to fund our investing activities by using our available liquidity  to the extent available  or by raising additional capital from the capital markets  which may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we become unable to generate cash flow from our operating activities  our available liquidity would be sufficient to fund investing activities for only a limited period of time 
our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  which in turn is dependent on our ability to attract new and retain existing customers  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  and the amount of non operating expenses required to operate our company  consisting primarily of interest expense 
as of december   our bank credit facility provided for total secured financing capacity of up to billion  subject to the satisfaction or waiver of applicable borrowing conditions  representing a reduction in the total financing capacity from billion at december  as a result of scheduled 
table of contents reductions in capacity and the prepayments described below 
as of december   this facility consisted of a billion revolving loan commitment  of which million has been borrowed  and billion in two classes of term loans  all of which has been borrowed 
in october  we amended our credit facility to increase the amount of revolving loans that may be used to support letters of credit from million to million to provide for the potential letters of credit associated with our relocation commitment under the consensus plan  and obtain the ability to prepay outstanding principal amounts under any class of term loan without concurrently being required to prepay outstanding principal amounts of other classes of term loans  as was required prior to the amendment 
in december  we reduced the principal amount of outstanding term loans under our credit facility by million by prepaying billion of term loans under that facility with cash on hand and the proceeds from the syndication of a new billion term loan under that facility that matures in december at the same time  we amended the facility to permit us at some future time to establish one or more series of incremental revolving loan commitments that would replace the existing revolving loan commitment as it is reduced or terminated  and to include a prospective consent of the lenders to certain possible future extensions of the existing revolving credit commitments 
the term loans mature on december  and december  on march   the amount of the revolving loan commitment available to us will be reduced by million and such reductions will increase to million every quarter beginning april  and continuing through march  starting april   the reductions become more significant until when no amounts will be available under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility requires compliance with financial ratio tests  including total indebtedness to operating cash flow  secured indebtedness to operating cash flow  operating cash flow to interest expense and operating cash flow to specified charges  each as defined under the credit facility 
the maturity dates of the loans may accelerate if we do not comply with the financial ratio tests  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are also obligated to repay the loans if certain change of control events occur 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial ratio tests under our credit facility and we expect to remain in full compliance with these ratio tests for the foreseeable future 
see forward looking statements 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets  and are guaranteed by us and substantially all of our subsidiaries 
there is no provision under any of our indebtedness that requires repayment in the event of a downgrade by any ratings service 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under the credit facility may be restricted by provisions included in some of our public notes and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness in certain circumstances 
the availability of borrowings under this facility also is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified borrowing conditions 
as of december   the applicable provisions of our senior notes and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock did not restrict our ability  and we had satisfied the conditions under this facility  to borrow substantially all of the remaining billion revolving credit commitment that is currently available 
the credit facility also contains covenants which limit our ability and the ability of some of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our or their capital stock or make specified other restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our or their assets  guarantee obligations of other entities  enter into hedging agreements  enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons or engage in any business other than the telecommunications business 
finally  except for distributions for specified purposes  these covenants limit the distribution of our subsidiaries net assets 

table of contents in addition to the retirements under our credit facility described above  from april  to december   we purchased and retired about  million in principal amount of our senior notes and convertible notes and in face amount of our preferred stock

table of contents capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures during totaled  million  including capitalized interest 
in the future  we expect our capital spending to be driven by several factors including the purchase and construction of additional transmitter  receiver sites and related switching equipment to enhance our network s geographic coverage and to maintain our network quality  the enhancements to our existing iden technology to increase data speed and voice capacity  any potential future enhancement of our network through the deployment of next generation technologies  and capital expenditures required to support our back office operations and additional nextel stores 
our future capital expenditures are affected by future technology improvements and technology choices 
in october  we began deploying the voice coder that is designed to allow us to more efficiently use our spectrum and reduce our network capital expenditures 
because the network efficiencies relating to the voice coder are dependent on use of handsets operating in the mode  our plans assume that the realization of the capacity and related financial benefits is timed to coincide with the deployment and use of those handsets 
it is our expectation that most of these benefits will not begin to be realized until after if there are substantial delays in the deployment of handsets operating in the mode  those benefits would also be delayed and our capital expenditures could increase in order to meet our network capacity needs 
see part i  item business e 
our network and technology our technology plans and forward looking statements 
development of technology enhancements like the voice coder would allow us to reduce the amount of capital expenditures we would need to make for our network voice capacity in future years 
however  any anticipated reductions in capital expenditures could be offset to the extent we incur additional capital expenditures to deploy next generation technologies 
we will deploy a next generation technology only when deployment is warranted by expected customer demand and when the anticipated benefits of services requiring this technology outweigh the costs of providing those services 
future contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts

in addition  we have less than billion of open purchase orders for goods or services as of december  that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  but are not recorded as liabilities as of december  we expect these commitments to become due in the above table excludes amounts that may be paid or will be paid in connection with spectrum 
table of contents acquisitions 
we have committed  subject to certain conditions which may not be met  to pay up to about million for spectrum leasing agreements and acquisitions  including about million for the pending acquisition of certain mmds fcc licenses  interests in certain mmds fcc licenses and other network assets of worldcom and nucentrix  entered into and outstanding as of december  included in the purchase obligations and other caption are minimum amounts due under some of our most significant service contracts  including agreements for telecommunications and customer billing services  advertising services and contracts related to our information and technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include items such as hours contracted  subscribers  interest rates and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
significant amounts expected to be paid to motorola for infrastructure  handsets and related services are not shown above due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and extent of these payments and because minimum contractual amounts under our agreements with motorola are not significant 
see note of the consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k for amounts paid to motorola in in addition  the table above excludes amounts that we may be required to or elect to pay with respect to nextel partners 
in january  we entered into agreements with nextel partners and other parties  including motorola  relating to the formation  capitalization  governance  financing and operation of nextel partners 
nextel partners is constructing and operating a network utilizing the iden technology used in our network 
in addition  the certificate of incorporation of nextel partners establishes circumstances in which we will have the right or obligation to purchase the outstanding shares of class a common stock of nextel partners at specified prices

as a result of the termination of our operating agreements as a result of a breach by nextel partners  the purchase price could involve a discount based on a pricing formula 

table of contents as a result of the election of a majority of the non nextel stockholders to require us to purchase  after nextel partners failure to implement changes in business  operations or systems required by us  the purchase price will be an amount equal to the higher of the fair market value as determined by the appraisal process and a rate of return on each tranche of invested capital in nextel partners  whether contributed in cash or in kind  from the date of its contribution through the purchase date  which value will be divided over all of nextel partners capital stock 
for any other reason  the purchase price will be the fair market value of the class a common stock 
under the certificate of incorporation of nextel partners  fair market value is defined as the price that a buyer would be willing to pay for all of nextel partners outstanding capital stock in an arm s length transaction and includes a control premium  as determined by an appraisal process

future outlook 
since the third quarter  our total cash flows provided by operating activities have exceeded our total cash flows used in investing and financing activities 
we expect to fund our capital needs for at least the next twelve months by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities 
see forward looking statements 
in making this assessment  we have considered the anticipated level of capital expenditures  our scheduled debt service requirements  consummation of existing agreements to purchase spectrum  including those with worldcom and nucentrix  and other future contractual obligations 
additionally  we have the ability to use existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand and available of billion as of december   or drawdown on the available revolving loan commitment under our credit facility of about billion as of december  to fund our capital needs 
if our business plans change  including as a result of changes in technology  or if economic conditions in any of our markets generally or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry change materially from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our mobile wireless business  the anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly 
our above conclusion that we will be able to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using cash generated from operations does not take into account the impact of our participation in any future auctions for the purchase of significant amounts of spectrum licenses  any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities other than those currently being pursued by us  deployment of next generation technologies  potential material additional purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities and preferred stock for cash  potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates see part i  item business k

our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that we cannot presently predict with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  and the market prices of our securities 
we have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  other than the existing arrangements that have been consummated or are described in this report  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital
