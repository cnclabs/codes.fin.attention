item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as deferred rent receivable  and is included in trade receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
certain leases provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
rental income also includes lease termination fees 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables related to base rents  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  provides guidance on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap to selected revenue recognition issues 
we have concluded that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with gaap and sab real estate we record land  buildings and building and tenant improvements at cost and they are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major replacements and betterments  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ordinary repairs and maintenance  are expensed as incurred 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings to years building improvements to years tenant improvements the shorter of the term of the related lease or useful life we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
for example  if we were to lengthen the expected useful life of a particular building improvement  the improvement would be depreciated over a greater number of years  resulting in less depreciation expense and higher net income on an annual basis 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  we assess whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset is less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the property 
when we identify assets as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the sales price  net of selling costs  of such assets 
if  in our opinion  the net sales price of the assets which we have identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
for investments accounted for under the equity method  a loss is recognized if the loss in value of the investment is other than temporary 
when we make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties  we have a direct impact on our net income  because taking an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income

accordingly  these amounts have been classified as discontinued operations 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
on october   nareit  based on discussions with the sec  provided revised guidance regarding the calculation of ffo 
this revised guidance provides that impairments should not be added back to net income in calculating ffo and that original issuance costs associated with preferred stock that has been redeemed should be factored into the calculation of ffo 
we historically have added back impairments in calculating ffo  in accordance with prior nareit guidance  and have not factored in original issuance costs of preferred stock that has been redeemed in the calculation of ffo 
we have revised our calculation of ffo in accordance with nareit s revised guidance in the table set forth below 
prior year amounts reflect the revised guidance 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as gains or losses from sales of property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
however  it should be noted that there are certain items  such as impairments  that are included within the definition of ffo that do not relate to and are not indicative of our operating performance 
furthermore  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may differ from the methodology utilized by other equity reits to calculate ffo and  therefore  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income  the most comparable gaap number  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net income available to common stockholders diluted   deduct minority interest in income of consolidated partnership  net income available to common stockholders basic   add depreciation and amortization continuing operations real estate assets    discontinued operations real estate assets   pro rata share of joint venture real estate assets   deduct gain on sale of real estate gain on sale of discontinued operations   pro rata share of joint venture gain on sale of real estate funds from operations basic    add preferred a dividends   minority interest in income of consolidated partnership  funds from operations diluted    net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities  net cash used in provided by financing activities   note preferred a shares have a dilutive effect for ffo calculations  but are anti dilutive for earnings per share calculations 
on july   we redeemed all preferred a shares outstanding  resulting in the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the redemption resulted in a one time discount  which is reflected above in the year ended december  excludes gain loss on sale of land 
as noted above  the calculation of ffo has been revised in accordance with revised nareit guidance 
ffo for the year ended december  includes a deduction in ffo of approximately million relating to impairments which amount  under prior nareit guidance  would have been added back in the calculation of  and increased  ffo over what is set forth above 
ffo for the year ended december  also includes a deduction of approximately million relating to our redemption of preferred stock in may which amount we historically did not include in the calculation of ffo and therefore would have resulted in an increase in ffo over what is set forth above absent the revised guidance 
as noted above  the calculation of ffo has been revised in accordance with revised nareit guidance 
as a result  the revised calculation of ffo for the year ended december  now reflects changes from previously disclosed ffo for such period  consisting of i an increase in ffo of approximately million relating to the redemption of preferred stock which amount previously was not included in the calculation of ffo  thereby decreasing previously disclosed ffo by such amount from that stated above for the year ended december   and ii a decrease in ffo of approximately million for impairments which amount previously was added back in the calculation of ffo  thereby increasing previously disclosed ffo by such amount from that stated above for the year ended december  as noted above  the calculation of ffo has been revised in accordance with revised nareit guidance 
as a result  the revised calculation of ffo for the year ended december  now reflects a change from previously disclosed ffo for such period  consisting of a decrease of approximately million for impairments which amount previously was added back in the calculation of ffo  thereby increasing previously disclosed ffo by such amounts from that stated above for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
therefore  as a general matter  it is unlikely that we will have any substantial cash balances that could be used to meet our liquidity needs 
instead  our liquidity needs must be met from cash generated from operations and external sources of capital 
short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  capital expenditures incurred to facilitate the leasing of space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and quarterly dividends and distributions that we pay to our common and preferred stockholders and holders of partnership units in a partnership that we control 
we believe that cash generated from operations  issuances under our standby equity distribution program  and borrowings under the fleet revolving facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily community and neighborhood shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  because consumers still need to purchase basic living essentials such as food and soft goods  even in difficult economic times 
however  general economic downturns  or economic downturns in one or more markets in which we own properties  still may adversely impact the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and our ability to re lease space on favorable terms as leases expire 
in either of these instances  our cash flow would be adversely affected 
we are not currently aware of any pending tenant bankruptcies that are likely to materially affect our aggregate rental revenues 
we may acquire large portfolios of community and neighborhood shopping centers  either through direct acquisitions or business combinations 
while we believe that the cash generated by any newly acquired properties will more than offset the operating and interest expenses associated with those properties  it is possible that the properties may not perform as well as expected and as a result  our cash needs may increase 
in addition  there may be other costs incurred as a result of the acquisition of properties  including increased general and administrative costs while we assimilate the properties into our operating system 
in some cases  we have invested as a borrower  co venturer or partner in the development or redevelopment of new properties  instead of developing projects directly 
pursuant to the terms of two of our joint venture agreements  we have agreed to contribute up to an aggregate of million of additional capital that may be required by such joint ventures 
we expect to fund the additional capital required by these joint ventures either out of excess cash from operations  or through draws on the fleet revolving facility 
we completed redevelopment projects in  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects was approximately million 
our current redevelopment pipeline is comprised of an additional redevelopment projects  the aggregate cost of which including costs incurred in prior years on these projects is expected to be approximately million 
we regularly incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we expect to pay for these capital expenditures out of excess cash from operations or  to the extent necessary  draws on the fleet revolving facility 
we believe that a significant portion of these expenditures is recouped in the form of continuing lease payments 
we have established a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares of common stock under this program at an average purchase price of per share 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in in light of the current trading price of our common stock  we do not anticipate effecting additional stock repurchases in the near future  although we could reevaluate this determination at any time based on market conditions 
we have also established a repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding preferred stock and public debt through periodic open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   no purchases had been made under this program 
the current quarterly dividend on our common stock is per share 
we also pay regular quarterly dividends on our preferred stock 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of directors  our ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
we also make regular quarterly distributions on units in a partnership that we control 
in addition  under the fleet revolving facility and the fleet secured term loan  we are restricted from paying common stock dividends that would exceed of our funds from operations as defined in the applicable debt agreement during any four quarter period 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  redevelopment projects that we undertake at our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at the time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred stock  capital raised through the disposition of assets  repayment by third parties of notes receivable and joint venture capital transactions 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets  our credit rating and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
currently  we have investment grade credit ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from two major rating agencies standard poor s bbb and moody s investor service baa 
a downgrade in outlook or rating by a rating agency can occur at any time if the agency perceives an adverse change in our financial condition  results of operations or ability to service debt 
if such a downgrade occurs  it would increase the interest rate currently payable under our existing credit facilities  it likely would increase the costs associated with obtaining future financing  and it potentially could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing 
based on an internal evaluation  the estimated value of our properties is above the outstanding amount of mortgage debt encumbering the properties 
therefore  at this time  we believe that additional financing could be obtained  either in the form of mortgage debt or additional unsecured borrowings  and without violating the financial covenants contained in our unsecured debt agreements 
in  we entered into the fleet secured term loan and issued an aggregate of million of unsecured notes in the convertible debt offering and the medium term notes offering 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common stock and preferred stock is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our stock 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on attractive terms 
we have selectively effected asset sales to generate cash proceeds over the last two years 
in particular  in december we sold four of our factory outlet centers and generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
in and  we also sold other assets and generated proceeds from certain of our joint venture projects and notes receivable that raised an additional million and million in gross proceeds  respectively 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
our ability to sell properties in the future in order to raise cash will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
the following table summarizes all of our known contractual obligations  excluding interest  to pay third parties as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt     capital lease obligations   operating leases     total      long term debt includes scheduled amortization and scheduled maturities for mortgage loans  notes payable including notes payable  other and credit facilities 
in january  we repaid million of mortgage indebtedness that was to mature in january we intend to repay million issued under our medium term note program that matures in october  as well as the balance of the mortgages due in approximately million either through draws under the fleet revolving facility or from the proceeds generated through the issuance of public or private secured or unsecured debt  or a combination thereof 
we anticipate repaying the balance of the contractual obligations  which consists primarily of scheduled amortization  through draws under the fleet revolving facility 
the following table summarizes certain terms of our existing credit facilities as of december  loan amount available to be drawn in thousands amount drawn as of december  in thousands current interest rate maturity date fleet revolving facility   libor plus bp april fleet secured term loan   libor plus bp september total   we incur interest using a day libor rate  which was at december  under certain circumstances  the maximum amount available under this facility may be increased to million 
we intend to increase the amount of the facility to the maximum million  pursuant to and in accordance with its terms  in the first six months of the fleet revolving facility and the fleet secured term loan require that we maintain certain financial coverage ratios 
these coverage ratios currently include net operating income of unencumbered assets to interest on unsecured debt ratio of at least ebitda to fixed charges ratio of at least minimum tangible net worth of approximately billion total debt to total adjusted assets of no more than total secured debt to total adjusted assets of no more than unsecured debt to unencumbered assets value ratio of no more than book value of ancillary assets to total adjusted assets of no more than book value of new construction assets to total adjusted assets of no more than funds from operations as defined in the applicable debt agreement payout ratio no greater than under the terms of each of the fleet revolving facility and the fleet secured term loan  the respective covenants will be modified to be consistent with any more restrictive covenant contained in any other existing or new senior unsecured credit facility that we enter into 
the fleet secured term loan also contains certain financial covenants relating to the operating performance of certain properties that collateralize the fleet secured term loan 
we have also issued approximately million of indebtedness under four public indentures 
these indentures also contain covenants that require us to maintain certain financial coverage ratios 
these covenants are generally less onerous than the covenants contained in our senior unsecured credit facilities  as described above 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under our existing credit facilities and public indentures  and we believe that we will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants 
however  if our properties do not perform as expected  or if unexpected events occur that require us to borrow additional funds  compliance with these covenants may become difficult and may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives 
in addition  these financial covenants may restrict our ability to pursue particular acquisition transactions for example  acquiring a portfolio of properties that is highly leveraged and could significantly impact our ability to pursue growth initiatives 
in addition to our existing credit facilities and public indebtedness  we had approximately million of mortgage debt outstanding as of december   having a weighted average interest rate of per annum 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not believe that we currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
however  in a few cases  we have made commitments to provide funds to joint ventures under certain circumstances 
the liabilities associated with these joint ventures do not show up as liabilities on our consolidated financial statements

other funding obligations in addition to the joint venture obligations described above  we also had the following contingent contractual obligations as of december   none of which we believe will materially adversely affect us non recourse debt guarantees 
under certain of our non recourse loans and those of our joint ventures  we could  under certain circumstances  be responsible for portions of the mortgage indebtedness in connection with certain customary non recourse carve out provisions such as environmental conditions  misuse of funds and material misrepresentations 
as of december   we had mortgage loans outstanding of approximately million and our joint ventures had mortgage loans outstanding of approximately million 
leasing commitments 
we have entered into leases  as lessee  in connection with ground leases for shopping centers which we operate  an office building which we sublet  and our administrative office space 
these leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum annual rental commitments for these leases during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are approximately as follows in thousands year thereafter  for a discussion of other factors which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources  please see the section titled risk factors in item i of this annual report on form k 
inflation the majority of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
these provisions contain clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents  which generally increase as prices rise but may be adversely impacted by tenant sales decreases  and or escalation clauses which are typically related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  we believe that many of our existing lease rates are below current market levels for comparable space and that upon renewal or re rental these rates may be increased to match  or get closer to  current market rates 
this belief is based upon an analysis of relevant market conditions  including a comparison of comparable market rental rates  and upon the fact that many of our leases have been in place for a number of years and may not contain escalation clauses sufficient to match the increase in market rental rates over such time 
most of our leases require the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  we periodically evaluate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  and may enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on floating rate loans 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non qualitative 
such risks principally include credit risks and legal risks 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate mortgages 
we also had approximately million outstanding under floating rate credit facilities 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material as of december   in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt  our billion of total assets and the billion total market capitalization as of that date 
in addition  as discussed below  we have converted million of fixed rate borrowings to floating rate borrowings through the use of a hedging agreement 
as of december   we had entered into one hedging agreement a reverse arrears swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  under which we will receive the difference between the fixed rate of the swap   and the floating rate option  which is the six month libor rate  in arrears 
hedging agreements may expose us to the risk that the counterparties to these agreements may not perform  which could increase our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
generally  the counterparties to hedging agreements that we enter into are major financial institutions 
we may borrow additional money with floating interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefit of existing or future hedging agreements  would increase our expense  which would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt 
future increases in interest rates will increase our interest expense as compared to the fixed rate debt underlying our hedging agreements and we could be required to make payments to unwind such agreements 
on january   in anticipation of the debt offering  we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the interest rate on million of the debt from a fixed rate to a blended floating rate of basis points over the month libor rate 
the swaps will terminate on february  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains at approximately million including the million reverse arrears swap  the balance as of december  if market rates of interest increase by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
this assumes that our total outstanding debt remains at billion  the balance as of december  as of december   we had no material exposure to market risk including foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity price risk
