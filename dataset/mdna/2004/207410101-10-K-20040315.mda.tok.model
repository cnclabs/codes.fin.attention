item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data item and our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
overview of conmed corporation conmed corporation conmed  the company  we or us is a medical technology manufacturing company with six major product lines 
these product lines and the percentage of consolidated revenues associated with each of them  are as follows arthroscopy powered surgical instruments electrosurgery patient care endoscopy integrated operating room systems consolidated net sales most of our products are used in surgeries with about of our sales coming from sales of disposable products 
we manufacture most of our products in plants in the united states 
we sell in the united states and internationally both direct to customers and through distributors 
international sales approximated of total net sales in and and of total net sales in business environment  opportunities and challenges as a result of an aging population and improved surgical procedures  we believe the overall market for our products is growing 
we intend to increase our overall market share by leveraging our entire portfolio of products to increase sales and profits 
an example of this is our entry in into the business of integrated operating room systems and equipment 
we can now offer one stop shopping to our customers by designing and installing integrated operating rooms and then providing the capital and disposable products for use in them 
where we believe it makes sense  we plan to continue to pursue acquisitions which enable us to fill gaps in or strengthen our product lines 
in addition  we may enter into agreements which enable us to quickly and inexpensively expand our product lines and leverage our distribution channels without an acquisition 
an example of this is the agreement which we entered in december with osi systems  inc  and its subsidiary  dolphin medical  inc  under which we are now the exclusive north american distributor for a full line of pulse oximetry products 
these products will become part of our patient care product line 
certain of our products  particularly our line of surgical suction instruments and tubing and our line of ecg electrodes  are more commodity in nature  with limited opportunity for product differentiation 
these products compete in very mature  price sensitive markets 
as a result  while sales volumes are increasing  we have experienced and expect we will continue to experience pricing and margin pressures in these product lines 
we believe we can continue to profitably compete in these product lines by maintaining and improving upon our low cost manufacturing structure 
in addition  we expect to continue to use the cash generated from sales of these relatively low margin  low investment products to invest in  improve and expand our higher margin product lines 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of product and passage of title to our customers 
factors considered in our revenue recognition policy are as follows o sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped 
payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
o we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital equipment shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
the cost of the equipment is amortized over the terms of the commitment agreements 
o product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in keeping with our returned goods policy 
product returns have not been significant historically 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon analysis of historical customer returns and credits  rebates  discounts and current market conditions 
o the terms of the company s sales to customers do not involve any obligations for the company to perform future services 
limited warranties are generally provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product shipment based upon analysis of historical data 
o amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in selling and administrative expense 
o we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
o we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for any probable losses from accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of our products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business acquisitions we completed several acquisitions in  including the bionx acquisition with a purchase price of million  and have a history of growth through acquisitions 
the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our business 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are also evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
an intangible asset is determined to be impaired when estimated future cash flows indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
although no goodwill or other intangible asset impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurances that future impairment will not occur 
in connection with the bionx acquisition  significant estimates were made in the million valuation of the purchased in process research and development assets 
the purchased in process research and development value relates to next generation arthroscopy products  which have been or are expected to be released between the second quarter of and fourth quarter of the acquired projects include enhancements and upgrades to existing device technology  introduction of new device functionality and the development of new materials technology for arthroscopic applications 
the value of the in process research and development was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis of the anticipated net cash flow stream associated with the in process technology of the related product sales 
the estimated net cash flows were discounted using a discount rate of  which was based on the weighted average cost of capital for publicly traded companies within the medical device industry and adjusted for the stage of completion of each of the in process research and development projects 
the risk and return considerations surrounding the stage of completion were based on costs  man hours and complexity of the work completed versus to be completed and other risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
in total  these projects were approximately complete as of the acquisition date 
the total budgeted costs for the projects were approximately million and the remaining costs to complete these projects were approximately million as of the acquisition date 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technologies and products based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from the estimated results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pension plan we sponsor three defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees 
these pension plans were merged effective january  major assumptions used in the accounting for the plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
lower market interest rates have caused us to lower the discount rate used in determining pension expense from in to in this change in assumption will result in higher pension expense in we have used an expected rate of return on pension plan assets of for purposes of determining the net periodic pension benefit cost 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 
in addition  we consult with financial and investment management professionals in developing appropriate targeted rates of return 
as a result of funding the maximum deductible pension contributions in  pension plan assets have increased substantially  which will result in higher expected returns and decreased pension expense in based on these and other factors  pension expense is estimated at approximately million 
actual expense may vary significantly from this estimate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
we have established a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards recognized in connection with the bionx acquisition 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations the following table presents  as a percentage of net sales  certain categories included in our consolidated statements of income for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expense 
research and development expense 
write off of purchased iprd other expense income income from operations loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to sales for were million  an increase of million compared to sales of million in the acquisition of bionx implants  inc in march the bionx acquisition accounted for million of the increase  the acquisition of core dynamics  inc in december the core acquisition accounted for million of the increase and favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for million of the increase 
the bionx and core acquisitions are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
o arthroscopy sales increased million in to million from million in  largely as a result of the bionx acquisition 
o powered surgical instrument sales increased million in to million from million in  largely on increased sales of our new powerpro r battery powered instrument product line 
o patient care sales increased million in to million from million in as sales of our ecg and surgical suction product lines continue to face significant competition and pricing pressures 
o electrosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  as a result of strong sales of our new system r electrosurgical generator 
o endoscopy sales increased million in to million from million in  largely as a result of the core acquisition 
o integrated operating room systems sales for were million as a result of a full year of the two acquisitions comprising this product line as compared to million for the last two months of cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increased sales volumes described above 
gross margin percentage decreased slightly to in as compared to in as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  during  we incurred million in acquisition related charges which are included in cost of sales 
additionally  as noted above  our ecg and surgical suction product lines continue to face significant competition and pricing pressures resulting in a lower gross margin in these product lines 
selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense totaled in compared to in the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is due largely to the transition to a larger  independent sales agent based sales force for our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
during  we restructured our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument sales force by increasing our domestic sales force from to sales representatives 
the increase is part of our integration plan for the bionx acquisition 
as part of the sales force restructuring  we converted direct employee sales representatives into nine independent sales agent groups 
as a result of this restructuring  we now have exclusive sales agent groups managing arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument sales representatives 
the transition in the sales force and its greater number of sales staff is expected to result in higher future sales growth in our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
research and development expense totaled million in compared to million in this increase is largely due to the bionx acquisition and represents continued research and development efforts focused primarily on product development in the arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
as a percentage of sales  research and development was  consistent with in we wrote off purchased in process research and development assets of million in connection with the bionx acquisition in the first quarter of this item is explained in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income in consists of a million gain on settlement of a contractual dispute offset by pension settlement losses of million and acquisition related charges of million 
other expense incurred during consists of a million loss on the settlement of a patent dispute 
these items are explained in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
losses on early extinguishment of debt of million in and million in are related to the refinancing of our debt agreements 
these items are explained in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to as well as lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings  inclusive of the implicit finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility  which decreased to in as compared to  in  as the senior subordinated notes the notes were retired in favor of lower cost bank debt as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes has been recorded at an effective rate of in and in the increase in effective rate is due to the nondeductibility of the in process research and development charge 
a reconciliation of the united states statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to sales for were million  an increase of million compared to sales of million in the acquisition of imagyn medical technologies  inc in july the imagyn acquisition accounted for million of the increase and favorable foreign currency exchange rates accounted for million of the increase 
the imagyn acquisition is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
o arthroscopy sales increased million in to million from million in  on strong sales of disposable products and video equipment 
o powered surgical instrument sales remained flat at million in and we believe the weakness in sales in the powered surgical instrument product line is a result of our aging battery powered product offering which was replaced in march with our new powerpro r battery powered instrument product line 
we believe that as powerpro r is established in the marketplace  as was evidenced in  it will enable us to resume overall growth in powered surgical instrument sales 
o patient care sales increased million in to million from million in as increases in sales of our ecg and other patient care product lines offset declines in sales of our surgical suction product lines which continue to face significant competition and pricing pressures 
o electrosurgery sales increased million in to million from million in  driven by increases in disposable product sales 
o endoscopy sales increased million in to million from million in the increase is largely a result of the imagyn acquisition 
o integrated operating room systems sales for were million as a result of two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of the increased sales volumes described above 
gross margin percentage remained consistent at in as compared with as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  during we incurred million in acquisition related charges which are included in cost of sales 
during  we sold sample powerpro r product  pursuant to a distribution agreement  at gross margins lower than the margins realized for units sold to end user customers 
in addition  during we experienced certain unfavorable production variances 
selling and administrative expense decreased to million in as compared to million in during  selling and administrative expense decreased by approximately million  before income taxes  as a result of the adoption of sfas and the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expense totaled in compared to in the decrease in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is due to reduced amortization expense as a result of the adoption of sfas research and development expense totaled million in compared to million in this increase represents continued research and development efforts primarily focused on product development in the electrosurgery  arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines 
as a percentage of sales  research and development was  consistent with in other expense incurred during consists of a million loss on the settlement of a patent dispute 
this charge is explained in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
losses on early extinguishment of debt of million in are related to the refinancing of our debt agreements 
these items are explained in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to as well as lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings  inclusive of the implicit finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility  which decreased to in as compared to in provision for income taxes has been recorded at an effective rate of for and a reconciliation of the united states statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from our operations  including sales of accounts receivable and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  provide the working capital for our operations  debt service under our senior credit agreement and the funding of our capital expenditures 
in addition  we use term borrowings  including o borrowings under our senior credit agreement  o borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property acquisitions  to finance our acquisitions 
cash provided by operations our net working capital position was million at december  net cash provided by operations increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in net cash provided by operations in was positively impacted by the following depreciation  amortization and deferred income taxes  the non cash write off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the extinguishment of our senior subordinated notes  the non cash write off of purchased in process research and development assets  and increased sales of accounts receivable and an increase in income taxes payable 
net cash provided by operations in was negatively impacted by the following million in pension contributions in excess of the million in net periodic pension benefit cost recognized in the consolidated statement of income made to reduce the underfunding of our pension plans  the increase in working capital as a result of the bionx acquisition discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  increases in accounts receivable and inventory as a result of growth in our business  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued interest  primarily related to the timing of the payment of these liabilities 
investing cash flows net cash used by investing activities in included million in payments related to business acquisitions  net of cash acquired  most of which is related to the bionx acquisition and the remainder related to several smaller acquisitions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the decrease in capital expenditures compared to a year ago is a result of the completion of several large capital projects 
capital expenditures representing the ongoing capital investment requirements of our business are expected to continue at the rate of approximately to million annually 
financing cash flows financing activities in consist primarily of million in borrowings under the senior credit agreement and the retirement  primarily in june  of million in senior subordinated notes discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the retirement of the million in notes  the company repaid an additional million in borrowings originating largely as a result of the bionx acquisition discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
annual savings in interest costs based on december  borrowing and interest rate levels as a result of the retirement of the notes is estimated at approximately million 
our senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december  the balance outstanding on the term loan facility at december  was million 
the term loan facility extends for approximately years  with scheduled principal payments of million annually through december increasing to million in and the remaining balance outstanding due in december we may be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess cash flow as defined in the amended senior credit agreement 
no such payments were required for the year ended december  interest rates on the term facility are libor plus at december  
interest rates on the revolving credit facility are libor plus at december the senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which have been sold in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement 
the senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require maintenance of certain working capital levels and financial ratios  prohibit dividend payments and restrict the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
the senior credit agreement contains a material adverse effect clause that could limit our ability to access additional funding under our senior credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur 
we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales 
we used term loans to purchase the property in largo  florida utilized by our linvatec subsidiary 
the debt assumed in in connection with the purchase consists of a note bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through june the class a note  and a note bearing interest at per annum compounded semiannually through june  after which semiannual payments of principal and interest will commence  continuing through june the class c note 
additionally  there is a seller financed note which bears interest at per annum with monthly payments of principal and interest through july the seller note 
the principal balances assumed on the class a note  class c note and seller note aggregated million million and million  respectively  at the date of acquisition 
the principal balances outstanding on the class a note  class c note and seller financed note aggregate million  million and million  respectively  at december  these loans are secured by our largo  florida property 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation crc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a commercial paper conduit 
the accounts receivable sales agreement was amended and restated on substantially the same terms and conditions on october  but replaced the commercial paper conduit with a bank 
the commercial paper conduit or the bank s the purchaser share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the purchaser and then to crc  but to the extent that the purchaser s share of collections were less than the amount of the purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables that have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable  including the purchaser s financing costs to purchase the accounts receivable  were million and million  in and  respectively and are included in interest expense 
there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in full compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to qualify for sale under the accounts receivable sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
to the extent that such collections would not be available to conmed in the form of new receivables purchases  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment  on an annual basis  from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment expires october  in the event we are unable to renew our purchaser commitment  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter amounts in thousands 
there were no capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt      purchase obligations     operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations      stock based compensation we have reserved shares of common stock issuance to employees and directors under three shareholder approved stock option plans 
the exercise price on all outstanding options is equal to the quoted fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
stock options are non transferable other than on death and generally become exercisable over a five year period from date of grant and expire ten years from date of grant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks involve foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
foreign currency risk we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and distribute our products throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as of december   we have not entered into any forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
during  changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased our sales by approximately million and income before income taxes by approximately million 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate our foreign currency exposure and the need to enter into a forward foreign currency exchange contract or other hedging arrangement 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our borrowings 
interest rate swaps  a form of derivative  are used to manage interest rate risk 
as of december   we had entered into an interest rate swap with a million notional amount expiring in june which effectively converts million of the approximate million of floating rate borrowings under our senior credit agreement into fixed rate borrowings with a base interest rate of 
assuming we make our scheduled term loan payments  if market interest rates for similar borrowings average more in than they did in  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap  would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates averaged less in than they did during  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap  would decrease  and income before income taxes would increase by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and interest rate swap agreement and do not consider any actions by management to mitigate our exposure to such a change 
credit risk a substantial portion of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals and other healthcare providers 
we generally do not receive collateral for these receivables 
although the concentration of these receivables with customers in a similar industry poses a risk of non collection  we believe this risk is mitigated somewhat by the large number and geographic dispersion of these customers and by frequent monitoring of the creditworthiness of the customers to whom credit is granted in the normal course of business 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures  and we believe that reserves for losses are adequate 
there is no significant net exposure due to any individual customer or other major concentration of credit risk
