overview our suite of business integration software solutions makes us a leading enabler of real time business 
we use the term real time business to refer to those companies that use current information in their businesses to execute their critical business processes 
we are the successor to a portion of the business of teknekron software systems  inc teknekron developed software  known as the tib technology  for the integration and delivery of market data  such as stock quotes  news and other financial information  in trading rooms of large banks and financial services institutions 
in  teknekron expanded its development efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and disparate manufacturing equipment and software applications primarily in the semiconductor fabrication market to communicate within the factory environment 
teknekron was acquired by reuters group plc  the global information company  in following the acquisition  continued development of the tib technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services markets 
in january  our company  tibco software inc  was established as an entity separate from teknekron 
we were formed to create and market software solutions for use in the integration of business information  processes and applications in diverse markets and industries outside the financial services sector 
in connection with our establishment as a separate entity  reuters transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to the intellectual property from which some of our messaging software products originated 
reuters also assigned to us at that time license and service contracts primarily within the high tech manufacturing and energy markets  including contracts with nec  motorola  mobil and chevron 
our products are currently licensed by approximately  companies worldwide in diverse industries such as telecommunications  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  energy  transportation  logistics  financial services  government and insurance 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through alliances with leading software vendors and systems integrators 
our revenue in fiscal  and consisted primarily of license and maintenance fees from our customers and distributors  including fees from reuters pursuant to our license agreement  both of which were primarily attributable to sales of our tibco activeenterprise product suite 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing project integration services 
we also receive revenue from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed and are usually on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 

table of contents our revenue is derived from a diverse customer base  and no single customer represented greater than of total revenue during fiscal or during fiscal  reuters represented of total revenue 
one customer  federal express  had a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  there were no customers with a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  or we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of collectibility and an allowance for returns and discounts based on specifically identified credits and historical experience 
since the first quarter of fiscal  adverse general economic conditions and conditions in the enterprise software industry have impacted purchases of our products and services as uncertainty in our potential customers businesses increased 
these conditions have caused our sales cycle to lengthen  customer budgets for research and development to decrease and customer purchases to be delayed or decreased in size 
we expect these conditions in the general economy and in our industry to continue to adversely impact our customers ability to purchase our products and services for the foreseeable future 
in response to these adverse business conditions  we initiated cost containment actions that included headcount reductions  abandonment of excess facilities and other cost reductions 
relationship with reuters reuters had been the primary distributor of our products to customers in the financial services segment since as of november   reuters owned approximately of our outstanding capital stock and nominated one member of our board of directors 
through the third quarter of fiscal  we had a license  maintenance and distribution agreement with reuters pursuant to which reuters was paying us certain minimum guaranteed distribution fees related to sales of our products to financial services customers 
reuters obligations with respect to these minimum guaranteed distribution fees were to expire at the end of calendar reuters guaranteed minimum distribution fees were million for each of the calendar years ended december   and these fees were recognized ratably in the period earned as related party revenue 
in addition  our previous agreement with reuters required us to provide reuters with internal maintenance and support for a fee of million per year plus an annual cpi based increase 
to date  this amount has been recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party service and maintenance revenue 
under our previous agreement with reuters  we were restricted from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market  except in limited circumstances 
accordingly  to date we have relied on reuters and  to a lesser extent  other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to financial services market customers 
in the past  when we did sell our products to financial services market customers other than through reuters or when we resold reuters products and services  we were required to pay certain fees to reuters  which were recorded as related party cost of revenue 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with reuters relating to the licensing  distribution and maintenance of our products that replaced our original agreement with reuters 
pursuant to the terms of this new agreement  reuters will continue to act as a non exclusive reseller of our products to certain specified customers in the financial services market until march and will pay us a distribution license fee equal to of license revenue it receives from sales to such customers 
reuters may also continue to use our products internally and embed them into its solutions 
we have agreed to provide certain fee based support services to reuters for tibco products reuters uses internally and may provide additional support services if purchased by reuters 
we will now have the right to market and sell our products  other than risk management and market data distribution products  directly and through third party resellers other than four specified resellers to customers in the financial services market 
the limitations on our ability to sell risk management and market data distribution products and to resell through the specified resellers will expire in may reuters has agreed to continue to pay us minimum guaranteed fees in the amount of million per quarter through march the quarterly minimum guaranteed fees will be reduced by an amount equal to of the license and maintenance revenues from our sales to financial services companies or  in the case of customers transitioned to us by reuters  of our maintenance revenue from such customers for up to one year after effectiveness of the agreement 

table of contents reuters began transitioning maintenance and support of our products for its customers  as well as associated revenue  upon entering into the new agreement 
as a result  we began providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters in the fourth quarter of fiscal consequently  service and maintenance revenue and associated costs increased as a result of our assumption of reuters contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we expect these increases to continue through at least fiscal to the extent  as a result of our increased service and maintenance obligations  our cost of revenue increases faster than our service and maintenance revenue  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
in addition to acting as a reseller of our products in the financial services market  reuters will be eligible to receive a fee of between and of revenue from sales to approved customers referred to us by reuters  depending upon the level of assistance reuters provides in supporting the sale 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended november  we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  accrued restructuring costs  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  and accounting for investments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by aicpa statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  when subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured at the time of the transaction 
in determining whether the fee is fixed or determinable we compare the payment terms of the transaction to our normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and recognize revenue as the payments become due 
we assess whether collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
generally  we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 

table of contents first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for such arrangements with multiple obligations  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values of ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support period 
fair value of services  such as consulting or training  is based upon separate sales of these services 
consulting and training services are generally billed based on hourly rates and revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
the determination as to whether services involve significant production  modification or customization of the underlying software code is a matter of judgment and can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
historically our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or bad debt expense recognized could result 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
based on our results for the year ended november   a one percentage point deviation in our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in revenue and or expense of approximately million 
accrued restructuring costs 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
our restructuring plan resulted in a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess field offices and relocation of corporate offices into one campus 
our restructuring charges included accruals for the estimated loss on facilities that we intend to sublease based on estimates of the timing and amount of sublease income and the non cash write down of leasehold improvements 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
as of november   a square foot per month change in our estimate of sublease income for space not yet sublet would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our accruals for excess facilities of approximately million 
vacancy rates for commercial properties in the san francisco bay area remain at high levels and there can be no assurance we will be successful in securing sublease income currently anticipated in our accrual for excess facilities 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under currently enacted tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance 
table of contents in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
a full valuation allowance is currently held against our net deferred tax assets because management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
our deferred tax assets include net operating losses relating to acquired businesses and the exercise of employee stock options for which any change in associated valuation allowance will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill and a credit to additional paid in capital  respectively 
we also do not provide for taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings indefinitely 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
due to our history of losses  as of november   we hold a full valuation allowance in the amount of million against our net deferred tax assets 
if we were to fully release our valuation allowance  we estimate that approximately million of the change would result in an income tax benefit  approximately million would be credited to goodwill and approximately million relating to stock option exercises and related tax credits would be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the following analysis demonstrates the potential effect the full release of our valuation allowance would have upon our consolidated financial statements and is not intended to provide a range of exposure or expected deviation in thousands  except per share data management s estimate release of valuation allowance valuation allowance income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income diluted earnings per share valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
we assess long lived and other intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived and other intangible assets may not be recoverable we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
as of november   we have not recorded an impairment charge against our long lived or other intangible assets 
on december  we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as related to goodwill and intangibles acquired prior to july  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but  instead  tested for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate that it might not be recoverable 
additionally  workforce no longer qualifies as a separately identifiable intangible and was reclassified as goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in the cessation of approximately million in goodwill amortization per quarter including reclassified amounts at the time of implementation 
in conjunction with adopting sfas no 
 we have determined that based on our current operations we operate in a single reporting unit 
accordingly we have performed the impairment assessment required under sfas no 
at the enterprise level 
we have used the market approach to assess the fair value of the enterprise 
as of november   we have million of goodwill and have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
changes in the valuation of goodwill could be substantial 

table of contents accounting for investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of november   million of marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
marketable securities are presented as current assets as we expect to use them within one year in current operations even though some have scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific identification method 
our investments also include minority equity investments in privately held companies that are generally carried at cost basis and included in other assets on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these investments are dependent on the performance of the companies in which we invested  as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment  we consider these factors as well as each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  we write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal and  we recognized impairment losses of million and million  respectively  relating to the other than temporary decline in value of certain equity investments 
as of november   minority equity investments totaled million 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments exists 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective 
changes in our assessment of the valuation of our investments could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions do not materialize or change

table of contents results of operations total revenue november  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue as percent of total revenue total revenue decreased for the year ended november  compared to the prior year and for the year ended november  compared to the year ended november  this decrease in total revenue was due primarily to the global economic slowdown and a reduction in information technology spending in general 
revenue from reuters accounted for  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  revenue from reuters was million  million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of fees under our license agreement with reuters 
revenue from reuters includes minimum guaranteed fees of million per quarter  which reuters has agreed to continue to pay through march  as discussed in relationship with reuters 
license revenue november  change change in thousands  except percentages license revenue as percent of total revenue license revenue decreased for the year ended november  compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to the global economic slowdown and a reduction in information technology spending in general 
in particular  many telecommunication customers have reduced spending on deployments of our technology from levels 
while the total number of license revenue transactions over  has increased from to  the average deal size has decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in license revenue decreased for the year ended november  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in license revenue was due to slowing sales in a weakened global economy 
the total number of license revenue transactions over  has decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  and there was a corresponding decrease in average deal size from approximately  to  we expect that license revenues will remain relatively constant as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal service and maintenance revenue november  change change in thousands  except percentages service and maintenance revenue as percent of total revenue service and maintenance revenue increased for the year ended november  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to an increased installed software base  which resulted in increase 
table of contents maintenance revenue 
during the year ended november   we added approximately new customers to our customer base as existing at november reuters began transitioning maintenance and support of our products for its customers  as well as associated revenue  to us upon entering into the new agreement 
as a result  we began providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters in the fourth quarter of fiscal consequently  service and maintenance revenue and associated costs increased as a result of our assumption of reuters contracts in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we expect these increases to continue through at least fiscal service and maintenance revenue increased for the year ended november  compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of additional maintenance revenue related to the growth in our installed software base  partially offset by a million decrease in service revenue 
we expect that service and maintenance revenue will grow in absolute dollars and will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries  third party contractor and associated expenses related to providing project integration services  the cost of providing maintenance and customer support services  royalties and product fees as well as the amortization of technologies acquired through corporate acquisitions 
the majority of our cost of revenue is directly related to our service revenue 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages cost of revenue  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from lower compensation  royalties  and travel costs  which were partially offset by increased internal consulting costs 
compensation expenses decreased by million as a result of a reduction in services and customer support staff 
a decreased level of travel in addition to renegotiated arrangements with travel providers resulted in a savings of approximately million in travel costs 
the purchase of our corporate facilities resulted in a net savings of approximately million 
royalty payments for licensed technologies embedded in our products decreased approximately million primarily due to the mix of products sold during the period and renegotiated agreements with these suppliers 
we periodically deploy consulting engineers for certain sales and marketing activities  the costs for which we then classify as sales and marketing expense 
we utilized fewer engineers on sales and marketing activities  which offset the cost of revenue savings in fiscal by million 
the decrease in cost of revenue in fiscal as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from a decrease in the use of third party contractors and lower commissions partially offset by an increase in internal consulting activities 
termination or renegotiation of agreements with third party contractors resulted in savings of approximately million 
commissions decreased by approximately million due to an overall lower level of sales upon which fees were payable 
in  certain development personnel were deployed to assist on consulting projects 
the costs for these personnel were classified as cost of revenue and resulted in an offsetting million increase in cost of revenue as compared to we expect that cost of revenue will grow in absolute dollars and will remain relatively consistent as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal 
table of contents research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  third party contractors and related costs associated with the development and enhancement of our suite of products 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in fiscal compared to the prior year was due primarily to a reduction in the cost of third party contractors in the amount of million and lower compensation costs of million 
in addition  the purchase of our corporate facilities resulted in a net savings of approximately million for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease in fiscal year compared to the prior year was primarily due to the termination or renegotiation of agreements with many of our third party contractors resulting in a savings of approximately million 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect that spending on research and development will remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in fiscal sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff and the cost of marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from lower internal consulting  travel  commission and promotion costs and referral payments to our integration partners 
several of our consulting engineers were utilized for sales and marketing activities in fiscal  which was not repeated in fiscal resulting in approximately million of cost savings 
an increased emphasis on internally generated sales resulted in a decrease in referral fees to integration partners of million 
a million decrease in commissions expense is mainly attributable to lower commissionable sales 
a decreased level of travel in addition to renegotiated arrangements with travel providers resulted in a savings of approximately million in travel costs 
in addition  promotion costs decreased by approximately million due to efficiencies gained from more specific and targeted advertising campaigns 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily due to decreases in sales commissions  travel and compensation costs 
sales commissions decreased approximately million due to 
table of contents lower commissionable revenue 
a decreased level of travel in addition to renegotiated arrangements with travel providers resulted in a savings of approximately million in travel costs 
in addition  compensation costs decreased by million due to lower head count 
we intend to selectively increase staff in our direct sales organization and to create select product marketing programs and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will increase modestly in absolute dollars in fiscal general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive  legal  finance  accounting and human resources 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation as percent of total revenue the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately million in savings from the purchase of our corporate facilities partially offset by increased compensation in the amount of million 
the decrease in fiscal as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt and compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
we believe that general and administrative expenses  exclusive of bad debt charges  will remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in fiscal stock based compensation stock based compensation expense principally relates to stock options assumed in acquisitions  stock options granted to consultants and the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercises of stock options 
we account for employee stock based compensation as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method and is shown by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re value consultant stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercises of stock options is included as a part of stock based compensation expense in the period the option is exercised 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages stock based compensation expense as percent of total revenue the decrease in stock based compensation in fiscal as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a million decrease in employee and acquisition related stock based compensation and a million decrease in employer required payroll taxes for stock option exercises 

table of contents the decrease in stock based compensation in fiscal as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a million decrease in employee and acquisition related stock based compensation 
acquired in process research and development november  change change in thousands  except percentages acquired in process research and development expense as percent of total revenue we estimated that million of the purchase price of talarian in fiscal represented acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
we calculated the value of iprd by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
in determining the value ultimately assigned to iprd we considered the stage of completion  complexity of work to date  difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the expected cost to complete the project 
the projects have subsequently been completed within management s estimates 
restructuring charge during fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities  million for related write down of leasehold improvements and million of other related restructuring charges 
these restructuring charges were recorded to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
we expect to benefit from a decrease in operating costs of approximately million annually through as a result of rent expense savings from the consolidation of our facilities 
the severance related actions are expected to decrease our salaries and benefits expenses by approximately million annually 
we recorded an additional accrual of million in fiscal for the estimated losses on facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of talarian as acquisition integration costs  which were included in the purchase price 
we are currently working with corporate real estate brokers to sublease unoccupied facilities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in headcount to further align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
this reduction of approximately employees was comprised of sales and marketing staff  general and administrative staff  and research and development staff 
this severance action is expected to reduce our salaries and benefits expenses by approximately million annually 
we do not expect the staff reductions  particularly those related to sales and marketing  to have an adverse impact on future sales 
all severance related actions were completed by august  
table of contents the following sets forth our accrued excess facilities costs as of november  these costs represent our estimated loss on abandoned facilities  net of sublease income  which we expect to pay over the next seven years 
see notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
excess facilities severance and other total fiscal charges cash utilized in fiscal balance at november  fiscal charges acquisition integration costs cash utilized in fiscal non cash write down of leasehold improvements in fiscal balance at november  fiscal charges cash utilized in fiscal non cash write down of furniture and fixtures in fiscal balance at november  included in consolidated balance sheet as a component of accrued liabilities 
amortization of acquired intangibles intangible assets are comprised of trademarks and established customer bases  as well as non compete  maintenance and oem customer royalty agreements 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangibles as percent of total revenue in fiscal and  we amortized goodwill  however  effective december   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives not be amortized but  instead  subject to impairment tests at least annually 
further  we reclassified million of intangible assets representing acquired workforce to goodwill as of december   and  therefore  this amount is no longer amortized 
amortization of goodwill and acquired workforce was million and million for fiscal and respectively 
the decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles in fiscal as compared to fiscal is principally due to the cessation of amortization of goodwill 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  includes interest  realized gains and losses on investments  long term debt interest expense and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
november  change change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income expense  net as percent of total revenue the decrease in fiscal compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately million decrease in net interest income and a million decrease in net gain on sale of investments partially offset by a million decrease in impairment charges on private equity investments 
net interest income decreased primarily due to lower average investment account balances as a result of the purchase of our corporate facilities along with continued declines in interest rates as investments matured and were reinvested in lower interest rate securities 
impairment charges on private equity investments were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the global economic slowdown and reduction in technology spending in general during fiscal had  and continues to have  a negative impact on these development stage companies in which we have invested 
the decrease in fiscal compared to the prior year was primarily due to an approximately million decrease in interest income expense as a result of lower interest rates combined with a million increase in impairment charge on private equity investment in there were no impairment charges recognized in fiscal income taxes management believes that  based on a number of factors  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded for the year ended november  during the next fiscal year  management will reassess the appropriateness of the valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future 
our income taxes payable for federal purposes has been reduced by the tax benefits associated with exercise of employee stock options 
these benefits were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million for fiscal as of november   our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through as of november   our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards were recorded as deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance reserved against them 
in the event of a change in ownership  as defined under federal and state tax laws  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitation 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before realization 
liquidity and capital resources at november   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing an increase of million from november  
table of contents net cash used for operating activities in fiscal was million resulting from our net income of million combined with non cash charges of million offset by the million advance payment of our property lease and a net change in assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used for operating activities in fiscal was million resulting from our net loss of million being offset by non cash charges of million and a net change in assets and liabilities of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million resulting from positive cash flows as our net loss of million was more than offset by non cash charges of million and by a net reduction of million in assets and liabilities 
in june  we entered into a year lease of the land upon which our corporate headquarters is located 
the lease was paid in advance for a total of million  but is subject to adjustments every ten years based upon changes in fair market value 
should it become necessary  we have the option to prepay any rent increases due as a result of a change in fair market value 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the terms of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal related primarily to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in the amount of million partially offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal related primarily to costs incurred in connection with the build out of our new corporate headquarters  cash used for acquisitions  purchase of short term investments and costs incurred in connection with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal related primarily to the purchase of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal  and  respectively  was million  million and million 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million and million from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase program 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal and resulted from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase program 
in june  we obtained a million mortgage note to purchase our corporate headquarters to lower our operating costs 
the note is collateralized by the commercial real property acquired 
the principal balance remaining at the end of the year term of million is due as a final balloon payment on july  we are prohibited from acquiring another company without prior consent from the lender unless we maintain between million and million of cash and cash equivalents  depending on various other non financial terms as defined in the agreements 
in addition we are subject to certain non financial covenants as defined in the agreements 
we are in compliance with all covenants at november  at november  and  we had million and million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  respectively 
we anticipate our operating expenses to remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future and as a result we intend to fund our operating expenses through cash flows from operations 
we expect to use our cash resources to fund capital expenditures as well as acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents in october  we entered into a registration and repurchase agreement with reuters 
pursuant to the agreement  if reuters sells more than million of our common stock held by it in a single transaction  we have agreed to repurchase an equal amount of common stock at the same price which the shares are sold to the public  up to a maximum of million 
we filed a registration statement on form s in november  which was declared effective by the sec in january  pursuant to which reuters may sell up to an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
as of november   our contractual commitments associated with indebtedness  lease obligations and operational restructuring are as follows  in thousands thereafter total operating commitments debt principal debt interest operating leases total operating commitments restructuring related commitments operating leases sublease income total restructuring related commitments total commitments as of november   future minimum lease payments under restructured non cancelable operating leases include million provided for as accrued restructuring costs and million for acquisition integration liabilities 
these amounts are included in accrued excess facilities costs on the consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with the mortgage note payable  we entered into a one year million revolving line of credit that matures on june  as of november   no amounts were drawn on this line of credit 
we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash  cash equivalent  and short term investment balance of million as well as other non financial covenants defined in the agreement 
we are in compliance with all covenants at november  as of november   we had a million irrevocable standby letter of credit in connection with the mortgage note payable 
this letter of credit automatically renews for successive one year periods  until the mortgage note payable has been satisfied in full 
the letter of credit is secured by the revolving line of credit described above 
as of november   we had a million irrevocable standby letter of credit outstanding in connection with a facility lease 
the letter of credit automatically renews annually for the duration of the lease term  which expires in december the investments pledged for security of the letter of credit are presented as restricted cash and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
as of november   we had a million irrevocable standby letter of credit outstanding in connection with a facility surrender agreement 
the letter of credit automatically renews annually for the duration of the letter of credit requirement of the surrender agreement  which expires in june the investments pledged for security of the letter of credit are presented as restricted cash and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual property infringement claims 
to date  no such claims have been filed against us 
we also warrant to customers that software products operate substantially in accordance with specifications 
historically  minimal costs have been incurred related to product warranties  and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been made 
in addition  we indemnify our officers and directors under the terms of indemnity agreements entered into with them  as well as pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and applicable provisions of delaware law 
to date  we have not incurred any costs related to these indemnification arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  we adopted sfas no 
on june  the adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
the consolidation requirements of fin are effective immediately for vie s created after january  the consolidation requirements for older vie s are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods beginning after june   however in october of the fasb deferred the effective date of fin for older vie s to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  certain disclosure requirements are effective for all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the vie was established 
we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of november  we will apply the consolidation requirements of fin in future periods should an interest in a variable interest entity be acquired 
factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in the forward looking statements we make about our business 
we have a history of losses  we may incur future losses  and if we are unable to sustain profitability our business will suffer and our stock price may decline 
we may not be able to achieve revenue or earnings growth or obtain sufficient revenue to sustain profitability 
while we achieved a modest profit of million for the fiscal year ended november   we incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing organization and in our technology research and development 
we expect to continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing enhancements to our existing and new software products and our direct sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we need to generate significant revenue to maintain profitability 
in addition  we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of our resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years 

table of contents our future revenue is unpredictable and we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters have not in the past  and may not in the future  meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
this has in the past and may in the future cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services by our competitors  the relatively long sales cycles for many of our products  the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal quarter or our fiscal year in the hope of obtaining more favorable terms  the timing of our new products or product enhancements or any delays in such introductions  the delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  changes in customer budgets and decision making process that could affect both the timing and size of any transaction  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations  and changes in local  national and international regulatory requirements 
our business is subject to seasonal variations which make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
our business is subject to variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors in the us and worldwide 
these factors include fewer selling days in europe during the summer vacation season and the impact of the holidays and a slow down in capital expenditures by our customers during our first fiscal quarter 
these factors typically result in lower sales activity in our first and third fiscal quarters compared to the rest of the year and make quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results less meaningful 
the loss of any current customer  including reuters which accounted for of our revenues in fiscal  could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we do not have long term sales contracts with any of our customers 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers  including reuters  will continue to purchase our products in the future 
as a result  a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods 
sales to reuters  a related party  accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal our new licensing  distribution and maintenance agreement with reuters more fully described below places certain limitations on our ability to conduct our business and involves various execution risks to our business 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with reuters relating to the licensing  distribution and maintenance of reuters products 
prior to such time  we were restricted from selling our products to customers in the financial services market 
pursuant to the terms of the new agreement with reuters  we are now permitted to market and sell our products  other than risk management and market data distribution products  directly and through third party resellers other than four specified resellers to customers in the financial services market 
reuters is phasing out its role as a general reseller of our products through march  at which time reuters distribution rights will terminate 
between now and march  reuters will continue to have a non exclusive 
table of contents right to distribute our products in connection with certain project implementations for a limited number of its existing customers and for pre existing customer leads 
after such time  reuters may continue to internally use and embed our products in its solutions 
consequently  our revenue from the financial services market will be dependent upon our ability to directly market and sell our products in such market or indirectly with resellers other than reuters 
reuters obligation to pay us minimum guaranteed distribution fees terminates in march any distribution fees from reuters beyond these guaranteed minimums would be dependent on reuters success in marketing and selling our products in the financial services market 
we believe that reuters may choose to devote their sales and marketing resources toward developing other aspects of their business and accordingly may not devote sufficient resources to effectively market and sell our products 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating enough revenue from financial services market customers to replace these minimum guaranteed payments after such time 
any inability on our part to replace the minimum guaranteed revenue from reuters would adversely affect our business and operating results 
neither reuters nor any third party reseller or distributor has any contractual obligation to distribute minimum quantities of our products 
reuters and other distributors may choose not to market and sell our products or may elect to sell competitive third party products  either of which may adversely affect our market share and revenue 
pursuant to the new agreement with reuters  reuters began transitioning maintenance and support of our products for its customers  as well as the associated revenue  to us upon entering into the new agreement 
as a result  we began providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters in the fourth quarter of fiscal if our support organization experiences an unexpected burden as a result of this transition  we may be unable to provide maintenance and support services in accordance with our current plans or customer expectations  which could have a negative impact on our customer relationships 
while we have no current plans to significantly expand our support organization  we may be compelled to do so to maintain these customer relationships 
moreover  we expect service and maintenance revenue and associated costs to increase as a result of our assumption of reuters contracts and the development of our direct sales organization for the financial services market in the fourth quarter of fiscal and through at least fiscal to the extent  as a result of our increased service and maintenance obligations  our cost of revenue increases faster than our service and maintenance revenue  our gross margins will be adversely affected 
under our new agreement with reuters  we are no longer prohibited from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market  however we are restricted from directly selling risk management and market data distribution products in such markets through may while we currently do not offer any risk management and market data distribution solutions as part of our product offerings  if we were to develop any such products  we would have to rely on reuters to sell those products in the financial services market until these restrictions end 
reuters is not required to help us sell any of these products in those markets and there can be no assurance that reuters would choose to sell our products over products of our competitors 
our license agreement with reuters also imposes certain practical restrictions on our ability to acquire companies in certain business segments 
the license agreement places no specific restrictions on our ability to acquire companies with less than half of their business in the sale of risk management and market data distribution products into the financial services market and to continue such business 
however  under the terms of the license agreement  if we acquire companies which derive more than half of their revenue from the sale of risk management and market data distribution products into the financial services market  or if we combine our technology with any acquired company s risk management or market data distribution products and services for the financial services market  then the acquired company s risk management or market data distribution solutions would become subject to our restrictions on selling risk management and market data distribution solutions to the financial services market until may this prohibition could prevent us from realizing potential synergies with companies we acquire or from pursuing acquisitions that could benefit our business 

table of contents our business may be harmed if reuters uses the technology we license from it to compete with us or grants licenses to such technology to others who use it to compete with us 
we license from reuters the intellectual property that was incorporated into early versions of some of our software products 
we do not own this licensed technology 
because reuters has access to intellectual property used in our products  it could use this intellectual property to compete with us 
reuters is not restricted from using the licensed technology it has licensed to us to produce products that compete with our products  and it can grant limited licenses to the licensed technology to others who may compete with us 
in addition  we must license to reuters all of the products  and the source code for certain products  we create through december this may place reuters in a position to more easily develop products that compete with ours 
reuters ownership of approximately of our stock and the terms of our stockholders agreement with reuters give reuters significant control over our business  and their actions may not necessarily be in the best interests of all of our stockholders 
pursuant to the terms of our stockholders agreement with reuters and certain other stockholders  reuters has a consent right with respect to certain fundamental decisions  including issuances by us of specified amounts of stock  acquisitions and other significant transactions  has additional rights with respect to board representation and registration of its tibco shares  and has certain financial information and inspection rights 
accordingly  reuters is able to exert a substantial amount of control over certain of our business activities 
the size of our board is currently set at nine members 
as of november   we had five directors serving on our board 
reuters has the right to nominate three directors for election to our board until such time as its stock ownership drops below  however  today  only one member of our board is a reuters representative 
if reuters stock ownership drops below  reuters will have the right to nominate two directors to our board until such time as its stock ownership is less than and will have the right to nominate one director until its stock ownership is less than 
in addition  if reuters stock ownership drops below  reuters consent right with respect to certain fundamental decisions will terminate 
the slowdown in the growth of the market for infrastructure software has caused our revenue to decline in recent periods and could cause our revenue or results of operations to fall below expectations in the future 
the market for infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our infrastructure software  including application integration software and related services 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on continued growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration and information delivery and companies seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
a weakening united states and global economy  which has had a disproportionate impact on information technology spending by businesses  has led to a reduction in sales in a number of recent quarters and may continue to do so in the future 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that when the economy revives and companies begin to make investments in information technology and infrastructure software that revenue will grow at the same pace 
any losses we incur as a result of our exposure to the credit risk of our customers could harm our results of operations 
most of our licenses are on an open credit basis  with payment terms generally of days in the united states  and  because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  seek to limit credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
because of the current slowdown in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks has increased 
there can be no assurance that  should economic conditions not improve  additional losses will not be incurred and that 
table of contents such losses will not be material or exceed our reserves 
although these losses have not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our past or future acquisitions may result in us incurring unanticipated expenses  encountering difficulty in integrating our operations  diluting our stockholders or incurring additional debt 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands  and competitive pressures 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in this regard  we acquired the businesses of talarian corporation in  praja  inc in  extensibility  inc in and inconcert  inc 
in we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisition or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate it profitably  or retain its key employees 
integrating any newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business and could distract our management 
for example  in connection with our largest acquisition talarian  we incurred acquisition liabilities of million related to severance and facilities restructuring 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisition  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that results in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  the terms of existing loan agreements may prohibit certain acquisitions or may place limits on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity securities to finance acquisitions 
if we are unable to integrate any newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  any amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our stock price may be volatile  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology companies in particular  have experienced volatility which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
during fiscal  for example  our stock price fluctuated between a high of and a low of 
if market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline in the future regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments 
sales of our stock by reuters could negatively impact our stock price and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock by reuters pursuant to the registration statement on form s filed in november  and declared effective in january  or otherwise  or by persons currently holding shares of our common stock that have not been previously sold to the public  could cause our stock price to decline 
in this regard  reuters and certain other stockholders who held in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock as of november  have certain rights to require us to register for resale on the public markets their shares of common stock 
in addition  sales of a substantial amount of our stock to a single purchaser or group of purchasers  or the reduction in concentration of ownership resulting from any sales by reuters  may make us more vulnerable to an unsolicited takeover attempt 
we have in the past incurred significant expenses in both hiring new employees and reducing our headcount in response to changing market conditions  and the volatile nature of our industry makes it likely that we will continue to expend significant resources in managing our operations 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased the scope of our 
table of contents operations both domestically and internationally 
we must successfully integrate new employees into our operations and generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these employees 
if we fail to successfully integrate employees or to generate the revenue necessary to offset employee related expenses  we may be forced to reduce our headcount  which would force us to incur significant expenses and would harm our business and operating results 
for example  in response to changing market conditions  in fiscal and  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  including million related to abandoned and other facilities and million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
during the fiscal  we recorded an additional restructuring charge of million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures and continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to control costs in any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
the outcome of litigation pending against us could require us to expend significant resources and could harm our business and financial resources 
we  certain of our directors and officers and certain investment bank underwriters have been named in a putative class action for violation of the federal securities laws in the us district court for the southern district of new york  captioned in re tibco software inc initial public offering securities litigation 
this is one of the number of cases challenging underwriting practices in the initial public offerings ipos of more than companies  which have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as in re initial public offering securities litigation 
plaintiffs generally allege that the underwriters engaged in undisclosed and improper underwriting activities  namely the receipt of excessive brokerage commissions and customer agreements regarding post offering purchases of stock in exchange for allocations of ipo shares 
plaintiffs also allege that various investment bank securities analysts issued false and misleading analyst reports 
the complaint against us claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statements for our ipo and secondary public offering and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased our securities or sold put options during the time period from july  to december  a lawsuit with similar allegations of undisclosed improper underwriting practices  and part of the same coordinated proceedings  is pending against talarian corporation talarian  which we acquired in that action is captioned in re talarian corp 
initial public offering securities litigation 
the complaint against talarian  certain of its underwriters  and certain of its former directors and officers claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statement for talarian s ipo and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased talarian securities during the time period from july  to december  a proposal to settle the claims against all of the issuers and individual defendants in the coordinated litigation was conditionally accepted by us and talarian on june  the completion of the settlement is subject to a number of conditions  including court approval 
under the settlement  the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in the action  and the assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters 
under the guaranty  the insurers will be required to pay an amount equal to billion less any amounts ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all the cases 
unlike most of the defendant issuers insurance policies  including ours  talarian s policy contains a specific self insured retention in the amount of  for ipo laddering claims  including those alleged in this matter 
thus  under the proposed settlement  if any payment is required under the insurers guaranty  talarian would be responsible for paying its pro rata share of the shortfall  up to  of the self insured retention remaining under its policy 
the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved lawsuits could harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
the defense of the lawsuits could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention 
table of contents away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  any such payment could seriously harm our financial condition and liquidity 
if we do not retain our key management personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
if we fail to retain and recruit key management and other skilled employees  our business and our ability to obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel  including vivek ranadiv  our president and chief executive officer 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued operations 
uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could also result in reduced confidence in our financial performance which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
we have experienced changes in our management organization over the past several years 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing our new management organization  our business would be harmed 
in addition  provisions of the recently enacted sarbanes oxley act of and related rules proposed by the sec and nasdaq impose heightened personal liability on some of our key management personnel 
the threat of such liability could make it more difficult to identify and hire highly skilled management personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales  marketing and engineering personnel 
competition for these people in the software industries is intense  and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
in addition  we have experienced turnover in our marketing and sales management 
although we have recently recruited a new executive vice president of worldwide sales  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our retention and training efforts 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
in addition  because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until a patent is issued  applications covering technology used in our software products may have been filed without our knowledge 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and seriously harm our business 
if we were to discover that our products violated the intellectual property rights of others  we would have to obtain licenses from these parties in order to continue marketing our products without substantial reengineering 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  and if we could not obtain such licenses  we might not be able to reengineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion 
if we fail to address any infringement issues successfully  we would be forced to incur significant costs  including damages and potentially satisfying indemnification obligations that we have with our customers  and we could be prevented from selling certain of our products 
our intellectual property or proprietary rights could be misappropriated  which could force us to become involved in expensive and time consuming litigation 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  patents licensed or others and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
any misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of protection of our proprietary information as do the laws of the united states 
if 
table of contents our proprietary information were misappropriated  we might have to engage in litigation to protect it 
in this regard  we have recently initiated a lawsuit against a third party seeking to prevent such third party from continuing certain practices we believe violate our intellectual property rights 
we might not succeed in protecting our proprietary information in any pending lawsuit or if we initiate additional intellectual property litigation  and  in any event  such litigation is expensive and time consuming  could divert our management s attention away from running our business and could seriously harm our business 
we must overcome significant competition in order to succeed 
the market for our products and services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid change 
we compete with various providers of enterprise application integration solutions  including webmethods and seebeyond 
we also compete with various providers of webservices such as microsoft  bea and ibm 
we believe that of these companies  ibm has the potential to offer the most complete set of products for enterprise application integration 
we also face competition for certain aspects of our product and service offerings from major systems integrators 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends or customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets or competition may intensify and harm our business and operating results 
if we are not successful in developing enhancements to existing products and new products in a timely manner  achieving customer acceptance or generating higher average selling prices  our gross margins may decline  and our business and operating results may suffer 
market acceptance of new platforms and web services standards may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of platforms 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may not be architecturally compatible with our software products 
in addition  the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining software products will increase as more platforms achieve market acceptance within our target markets 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the enterprise application integration marketplace may not be compatible with our current software products 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our software products or adapt to new platforms  our sales and revenues will be adversely affected 
developing and maintaining different software products could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could harm our revenue and financial condition 
if we are not able to develop software for accepted platforms or fail to adopt webservice standards  our license and service revenues and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the platforms we have developed software for are not accepted  our license and service revenues and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs  limit our ability to obtain director and officer liability insurance and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and directors 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the sec and nasdaq  may cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially 
table of contents higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new and proposed rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
if we are required to treat employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans as a compensation expense  it could significantly reduce our net income and earnings per share 
there has been ongoing public debate whether employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans shares should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
if we elected or were required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method  we could have significant accounting charges 
for example in fiscal year  had we accounted for stock based compensation plans as a compensation expense  annual diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by per share 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense using the fair value method in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock based compensation as a compensation expense using the fair value method 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is years 
at the end of fiscal  and  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million  million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities
