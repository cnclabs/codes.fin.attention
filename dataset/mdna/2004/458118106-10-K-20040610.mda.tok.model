item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we recommend that this discussion and analysis be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include  but are not limited to operating results  new product introductions and sales  competitive conditions  capital expenditures and resources  manufacturing capacity utilization  customer demand and inventory levels  intellectual property issues  and the risk factors set forth in the section factors affecting future results 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  actual results could differ from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
unless otherwise required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these statements for future events or new information after the date of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements  which are generally identified by words such as anticipates  expects  plans  and similar terms  include statements related to revenues and gross profit  restructuring and asset impairment charges  research and development activities  selling  general  and administrative expenses  intangible expenses  interest income and other  taxes  capital spending and financing transactions  as well as statements regarding successful development and market acceptance of new products  industry and overall economic conditions and demand  and capacity utilization 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
our estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider to be appropriate in the circumstances 
however  actual future results may vary from our estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical as defined by the securities and exchange commission  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require significant management judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies  including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are significant  difficult or subjective 
these policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we consider various tax planning strategies  forecasts of future taxable income and our most recent operating results in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the consideration of the realizability of net deferred tax assets  recent results must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for any of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
in addition  we record liabilities related to income tax contingencies 
determining these liabilities requires us to make significant estimates and judgments of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due based on potential tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions throughout the world 
our estimates are based on the outcomes of previous audits as well as the precedents set in tax cases which include similar tax positions to those taken by the company 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and affect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
inventories 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we record reserves for obsolete and excess inventory based on our forecasts of demand over specific future time horizons 
we also record reserves to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market which rely on forecasts of average selling prices asps in future periods 
actual market conditions  demand  and pricing levels in the volatile semiconductor markets that we serve may vary from our forecasts  potentially impacting our inventory reserves and resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill 
we own and operate our own manufacturing facilities  as described in part i of this annual report  and have also acquired certain businesses and product portfolios in recent years 
as a result we have significant property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate these items for impairment on an annual basis  or sooner  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
triggering events for impairment reviews may include adverse industry or economic trends  restructuring actions  lowered projections of profitability  or a sustained decline in our market capitalization 
evaluations of possible impairment and  if applicable  adjustments to carrying values  require us to estimate  among other factors  future cash flows  useful lives and fair market values of our reporting units and assets 
actual results may vary from our expectations 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in connection with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed a transitional goodwill impairment review as of the beginning of fiscal and annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of fiscal and these reviews found no impairment 
under our accounting policy we will continue to perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each future fiscal year  or more often if indicators of impairment exist 
our annual reviews consider estimates of the fair value of our reporting units  and may include analyses of projected discounted cash flows  using management s estimates of future revenues and expenses over a multi year horizon 
as of march   our assets included million in goodwill related to the acquisitions of newave and solidum 
overview for the first time since fiscal  we posted net income  primarily due to a recovery in the economy  the market segments we serve  and demand for our products  but also related to our lowered cost structure as a result of the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal with the exception of our second fiscal quarter  we experienced sequential growth in revenues  operating income and net income in each of the quarters of fiscal we have seen improved demand across our market segments  as well as a better pricing environment for our products 
during fiscal  rates of decline in our average selling prices asps moderated  and we were able to raise prices on selected products 
with supply tightening in a market that has signs of improving demand for our products  we expect asps to remain fairly consistent over the coming year and expect our units sold to increase throughout the year  which could result in moderate growth in our revenues for the upcoming year 
as our results have continued to improve  we have initiated investment in additional wafer capacity for our hillsboro fabrication facility to meet the increased demand 
we have also increased the number of employees at selected locations throughout the company to support the increased levels of operations and anticipate this continuing throughout fy during the year  we maintained a focus on opportunistically enhancing our business through acquisitions with the acquisition of certain packet processing technologies from ibm during the second fiscal quarter 
in addition  shortly after the end of the fiscal year  we announced the acquisition of zettacom  a privately held company  which we believe will accelerate our entry into the advanced serial switching market 
results of operations revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of million or compared to the previous year 
overall units sold were up significantly as a result of recovery across the markets we serve from million units in fiscal to million units in fiscal  but this increase in unit volumes sold was largely offset by lower asps per unit for our products which were down by during fiscal revenues for our communications and high performance logic segment which includes nses  cies  fifos  multiports  and flow control management devices  communications applications specific standard products assps  and high performance logic and timing products increased by million or  while revenues for our srams segment increased by million or 
units sold were up significantly in both segments as we exited the year with increasing demand for our products 
despite seeing prices begin to stabilize late in the year  asps were down significantly for the year 
throughout fiscal  we continued to see the shift of our revenues to the asia pacific apac region primarily related to growth in our consignment programs with contract manufacturers in the region as our end customer platforms migrate there to be assembled in lower cost environments 
our revenues in the apac region excluding japan increased significantly in fy as compared to fy  rising 
revenues in japan also increased in fy as compared to one year ago by approximately 
the americas region was most adversely affected by the shift  declining during the year 
in europe  revenues were also lower by approximately revenues recent trends and outlook 
exiting the year  we have seen a trend of increased bookings  higher levels of demand for our products  and more favorable pricing as demand begins to increase relative to world supply capacities 
if these trends continue  we could experience moderate revenue growth in fiscal revenues fiscal compared to fiscal 
our revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or compared to the previous year 
for both of our product segments  increases in units sold were more than offset by declines in asps 
pricing pressures were greatest where multiple sources of supply existed  such as in our sram segment 
revenues for our communications and high performance logic segment declined by million or 
revenues for our srams segment declined by million or 
during fiscal  we experienced a trend of our business shifting away from the americas and to the apac region 
revenues increased within the apac region excluding japan to of consolidated revenues in fiscal  up from in fiscal the shift was attributable to an increasing change in business environment in which customers  increasingly focused on lowering their costs  are utilizing contract manufacturers within apac to manufacture their products 
gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  an increase of million compared to the million recorded in fiscal our gross profit margin percentage for was compared to for fiscal the substantial increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to the restructuring and impairment charges of in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal in addition  gross profit benefited from significantly better manufacturing utilization in fiscal  primarily related to purposefully reducing our inventory levels throughout fiscal  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year to million at the end of the fiscal year 
depreciation and technology amortization expenses were also lower by million and million  respectively  due to the asset impairment charges taken in q finally  retention bonuses of million related to closing our salinas manufacturing facility in q did not recur in these benefits were partially offset by lower allocations of manufacturing spending to r d of approximately million 
in addition  we estimate that gross profit benefited by million during the year as a result of sales of inventory previously reserved as excess or obsolete  slightly less than the million benefit in fiscal gross profit fiscal compared to fiscal 
gross profit for fiscal was million  down from million in fiscal our gross profit margin percentage declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline in gross profit in fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in restructuring and asset impairment charges to million in fiscal from million if fiscal for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring charges  asset impairment  and other  below 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted in fiscal by lower revenues and poorer utilization of our hillsboro wafer manufacturing facility  as we purposefully reduced our inventory levels by almost half over the course of the fiscal year 
higher unit sales volumes and a somewhat better mix of products sold were more than offset by lower product average selling prices 
the above adverse impacts were only partially offset by cost savings related to the closure of our salinas wafer fabrication facility  reduced variable spending in hillsboro related to the lower production volumes  and lower personnel related costs  as a result of reductions in force implemented in both fiscal and fiscal finally  gross profit in fiscal benefited from the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved as excess 
restructuring charges  asset impairment and other 
during fiscal  after three consecutive quarters in which revenues either improved or remained essentially unchanged from the immediately preceding period  revenue declined measurably in the third quarter of fiscal during the course of the fourth quarter of fiscal  taking this drop off into consideration as well as the persistent weak global and industry economic conditions  we revised our near and medium term revenue expectations downward significantly 
we also reviewed corresponding key assumptions in our overall strategic business and manufacturing capacity plans 
these material changes in our outlook and plans  which we were first able to quantify in our fiscal fourth quarter budgeting process  triggered an impairment review of our long lived assets 
our impairment review indicated that estimated future undiscounted cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of plant and equipment related to both our wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro and our offshore test and assembly plants 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down these assets  which we continue to hold and use  to their estimated fair values 
of the million charge  million was recorded as cost of sales and the remainder as research and development 
management is responsible for the estimated fair values utilized to record the asset impairment charges 
management considered a number of factors to estimate the fair values  including valuations and appraisals  when making these determinations 
methods used in estimating the fair market values of the facilities included considering results from independent appraisals which incorporated standard real estate appraisal techniques including the cost approach  the income approach  and the comparable sales approach 
for specific equipment  we estimated fair market value primarily using recent sales data available for comparable equipment 
we then compared the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the assets and recorded an impairment charge for the difference 
we also determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal that certain intangible assets related to our acquisition of newave  specifically existing technology  had also become impaired  and we recorded a million charge to cost of sales to adjust the existing technology asset to its estimated fair market value 
our revenue estimates at the time of the acquisition were made when the market outlook was considerably more favorable 
we expect to continue generating cash flows from these intangible assets at levels consistent with or higher than with those used in the fy impairment analysis 
in performing the overall impairment analysis for goodwill  we followed the guidance under paragraph of fas  which requires long lived assets  other than goodwill  be tested for impairment first and that the carrying amount of these assets be adjusted for impairment before testing goodwill 
accordingly  only after adjusting the carrying value of the above long lived assets  due to their impairment  did we then test the goodwill noting no impairment 
in fiscal  we also took actions  including reductions in force and the closure of certain design and sales facilities  to better align our business model with then current industry conditions and our revised revenue expectations 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million  which consisted primarily of severance and related termination benefits related to reductions in force totaling approximately positions 
the charges were incurred in the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and were recorded as cost of revenues million and operating expenses million 
at the time the impairment and restructuring charges were taken in fy  anticipated savings for fy were as follows in thousands cogs r d sg a total depreciation and amortization compensation related facilities and other total our actual results through the end of fiscal were not significantly different from our expectations  however  additional capital equipment purchases and selective additions to manufacturing headcount had a minor offsetting effect 
fiscal was also a year of cyclically poor business conditions and overcapacity in the semiconductor industry 
as a result  we recorded a million asset impairment charge and million in restructuring charges  of which million was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remainder as operating expenses 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we performed impairment reviews of our manufacturing facilities 
we determined that future undiscounted cash flows related to our salinas wafer fab  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying values of the assets in that facility 
we accordingly wrote down the assets to their fair values  resulting in a charge of million 
management considered a number of factors to estimate the fair values  including valuations and appraisals  when making these determinations 
in fiscal  we recorded million in expenses related to restructuring actions  consisting mainly of worldwide reductions in force in our manufacturing and administrative organizations 
such expenses were recorded as cost of goods sold million and operating expenses million 
as of the end of fiscal  no accrual remains related to these restructuring actions 
in addition to expenses specifically identified as asset impairment and restructuring charges  we incurred other salinas related closure expenses in fiscal and  mainly for retention bonuses 
these expenses totaled million in fiscal million in fiscal 
we phased out production at the salinas wafer fab and completed the transfer of production to our hillsboro wafer fab in the first quarter of fiscal  and we first realized the full benefit in gross profit of this consolidation in the second quarter of fiscal research and development 
r d expenses declined by million in fiscal to million 
the largest driver of the decrease was due to the asset impairments and restructuring activities including the closure of our dallas design center  which we estimate represented a million savings for the year 
in addition  lower allocations of manufacturing costs to r d of approximately million contributed significantly to the change as manufacturing capacity was proportionally more focused on production activities rather than r d activities 
finally  deferred compensation expense in connection with our acquisition of newave was also lower by million as a result of the completion of the vesting provisions of arrangements with certain key newave employees 
r d expenses were essentially flat over the period from fiscal to during fiscal  lower allocations of manufacturing costs to r d activities of approximately million  lower product tooling costs of million  lower outside product development fees of million  and lower stock based deferred compensation expenses related to our newave acquisition of million were offset by a charge of million for the impairment of r d assets primarily related to our hillsboro fabrication facility and increased design engineering costs associated with our acquisition of solidum 
in fiscal  our new product development efforts are expected to continue to focus in such areas as networking and switching products such as our network search engines incorporating content addressable memory or cam technology and content inspection engines  flow control management devices  fifo buffers  multi ported specialty memory products  timing and clock products  integrated communications processors  and advanced telecommunications products 
in addition  we expect significant product development efforts will be devoted to products in our newly formed serial switching division  including switch fabric and traffic management technologies and to new products within our timing solutions division  such as pc clocks 
we are also continuing to develop manufacturing process technologies designed to increase efficiency or enable product performance advantages 
as a result of the increased development efforts described above along with projected increases in certain performance and other related personnel costs  we expect that r d spending in fiscal will increase slightly in comparison to fiscal selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses declined by million in fiscal to million 
the decrease was primarily due to the restructuring and other cost reduction actions taken during fiscal these savings were mainly related to savings in labor and other employee related expenses as a result of multiple reductions in force which we estimate represented million in savings 
in addition  expenses related to outside services were lower by approximately million in fiscal as a result of cost control measures 
sg a expenses declined by million in fiscal to million  with the decrease driven by lower personnel and revenue related costs 
personnel related costs were lower by million due to multiple reductions in force  offset partially by related severance costs 
outside sales commissions were down by million due to lower revenues and a new commission plan implemented early in the year and depreciation was also lower by million 
these savings were partially offset by higher spending on outside services  including legal  tax  and auditing services  which increased by million and corporate insurance which increased by million during fiscal  and by bad debt expenses which were million lower than in fiscal during fiscal  goodwill related to the newave transaction was amortized to expenses in accordance with an estimated useful life of seven years using the straight line method 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 amortization of certain intangibles  primarily goodwill  ceased as of the beginning of fiscal this decreased expenses within sg a by million in fiscal compared to fiscal we currently expect sg a expenses to increase modestly in fiscal  due largely to projected increases in revenue and performance tied selling and personnel related costs 
acquired in process research and development 
during fiscal  in connection with our acquisition of certain technologies for use in high speed packet processing from ibm  we recorded a million charge for acquired in process research and development ipr d 
also  in connection with our acquisition of solidum  we recorded a million charge for acquired ipr d in fiscal finally  we recorded a million charge for ipr d in fiscal related to our acquisition of newave 
for each of these transactions  the allocation of the purchase price to ipr d was determined by identifying technologies that had not attained technological feasibility and that did not have future alternative uses 
details of significant ipr d charges are as follows newave had five ipr d projects at the time of the acquisition 
these projects included multiple caller id related technologies to enable advanced caller id functionality and t isdn related technologies to enable advances in transferring voice and data simultaneously 
the details of these projects at the time of acquisition were as follows in thousands assigned ipr d fair value percentage complete discount rate estimated cost to complete at date of acquisition forecast release date actual product release date project a  aug feb project b oct jul project c oct canceled other projects aug apr feb jul gains and losses on equity investments  net 
activity for the periods presented is summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal realized gains on sales of pmc shares  realized gain on sale of mosys shares  other than temporary impairment charge on pmc shares  gains losses on equity investments  net    during fiscal  we sold our remaining shares of pmc sierra pmc resulting in a net gain of million 
during fiscal  we recorded a million pretax other than temporary impairment charge also related to this investment 
at that time  we determined that an other than temporary decline had occurred because the market value of the shares had been significantly below our carrying value for a consecutive six month period and we had no evidence that the reduction in value would be recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
in the first quarter of fiscal  monolithic system technology mosys  a company that we held an investment in  completed an initial public offering 
our carrying value for the mosys shares held in our investment portfolio was previously zero 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold all of our mosys shares and realized a pretax gain of million 
also  during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold  pmc shares and realized a pretax gain of million 
interest income and other  net 
changes in interest income and other  net are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal interest income    other income  net   interest income and other  net    the decrease in interest income in fiscal of million is principally due to lower average interest rates on our investment portfolio  as the proceeds of maturing investments were reinvested in a lower interest rate environment 
the million decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal is principally due to lower rates and to a lesser extent  lower balances 
other income  net  increased by million in fiscal primarily as a result of higher gains on sales of investments throughout fiscal other income  net in fiscal was significantly lower than fiscal as fiscal included a pre tax gain of million related to our exercise of an option to purchase land adjacent to our wafer manufacturing facility in hillsboro 
immediately following the option exercise  we sold most of the underlying property and recognized the gain 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal against our net deferred tax assets 
we have continued to record no tax benefit for tax losses and tax credits generated during fiscal  as we maintain the position that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize our net deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
even though we generated taxable income for fy and we currently expect to be profitable for fy  we are required to place substantially more weight on our historical results over a longer historical period than just the past fiscal year 
thus  management has determined these valuation reserves are still appropriately maintained at the end of fy the tax benefit recorded for fiscal includes  however  million for tax refunds we received related to previous tax years 
the benefit of these refunds was partially offset by tax expense related to income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
our tax provision of million for fiscal consists primarily of a valuation allowance recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal against our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of establishing this valuation allowance  we recorded no tax benefit on pretax losses and tax credits generated during fiscal we currently expect that our fiscal tax provision expense will continue to relate solely to tax expense being recorded on income generated in certain foreign tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and marketable securities were million at march   an increase of million compared to march  long and short term debt  excluding operating leases  was million as of march  net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in fiscal approximately of the increase relates to cash provided by net income adjusted for non cash items  and the remaining increase is due to changes in working capital 
working capital sources of cash included decreases in inventories  net and other assets  as well as an increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
other assets decreased as a result of million in net proceeds from the sale of building and equipment  classified as assets held for sale  related to our salinas facility and million related to a financing repayment from a distributor during the year 
inventories decreased as a result of the management of our inventory levels during the year and stronger demand for our products 
deferred income on shipments to distributors increased by million over this period  as our distributors began to increase their inventory levels to meet anticipated customer demand 
working capital uses of cash included an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable increased during the year as a result of higher revenues  the effect of distributors building inventory where accounts receivable increases as channel inventory grows and the continued shift in our business to contract manufacturers  particularly in apac  who have negotiated extended payment terms 
the decrease in other accrued liabilities primarily relates to deferred revenue which was recognized during the year in connection with license agreements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to a use of million for fiscal during fiscal  our net loss  exclusive of non cash charges  was largely offset by depreciation and by changes in working capital balances 
inventories were reduced by million during fiscal as we purposely worked down our inventories to better align with then current business levels 
deferred income on shipments to distributors decreased by million over this period  as our distributors also reduced levels of channel inventory 
we used million  million and million for investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our proceeds from sales of short term investments  net of purchases  were million lower than fiscal on the other hand  purchases of plant and equipment decreased by million as we tightened our capital spending budget entering the year in an effort to control costs 
also  fiscal contained two large expenditures of cash which did not recur in fiscal these were our terminating the synthetic lease related to our hillsboro  oregon  manufacturing site by purchasing approximately million in additional fixed assets and our investment of million in an interest bearing  convertible financial instrument which was subsequently converted into preferred shares of a privately held technology company 
the main drivers of the increase in cash used for investing activities in are the one time items discussed above which occurred in fiscal partially offset by million paid in fiscal for the acquisition of newave 
our financing activities in fiscal provided million in cash as compared to cash used of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the main source of cash inflows in fiscal related to million attributable to issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and purchase of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  there were no repurchases of common stock during fiscal as compared to repurchases of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  to be financed through cash generated from operations and existing cash and investments 
this estimate includes costs to increase our wafer manufacturing capacity at our fabrication facility in hillsboro 
the following table summarizes our contractual arrangements at march   and the expected timing and effects of these commitments on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt capital leases   operating leases      other long term  cash liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total      purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent binding contractual obligations  as purchase orders often represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we generally do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation prior to services being performed without significant penalty 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs through fiscal we may choose to investigate other financing alternatives  however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  as of march   the company had no financial instruments within the scope of this pronouncement 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec or the staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab eitf was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the application of sab had no impact to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal factors affecting future results our operating results can fluctuate dramatically 
we recorded net income of million in fiscal after recording losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
fluctuations in operating results can result from a wide variety of factors  including the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and industry wide wafer processing capacity  changes in demand for our products and in the markets we serve  the success and timing of new product and process technology announcements and introductions from us or our competitors  potential loss of market share among a concentrated group of customers  competitive pricing pressures  changes in the demand for and mix of products sold  complex manufacturing and logistics operations  availability and costs of raw materials  and of foundry and other manufacturing services  costs associated with other events  such as intellectual property disputes  or other litigation  and political and economic conditions in various geographic areas 
in addition  many of these factors also impact the recoverability of the carrying value of certain manufacturing  tax  goodwill  and other tangible and intangible assets 
as business conditions change  future write downs or abandonment of these assets may occur 
for example  in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges totaling million for certain manufacturing  research and development  intangible and tax assets 
further  we may be unable to compete successfully in the future against existing or potential competitors  and our operating results could be harmed by increased competition 
our operating results are also impacted by changes in overall economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
should economic conditions deteriorate  domestically or overseas  our sales and business results could be harmed 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry exacerbates the volatility of our operating results 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
substantial changes in demand for our products have occurred rapidly and suddenly in the past 
in addition  market conditions characterized by excess supply relative to demand and resulting pricing declines have also occurred in the past 
significant shifts in demand for our products and pricing declines resulting from excess supply may occur in the future 
large and rapid swings in demand and pricing for our products can result in significantly lower revenues and underutilization of our fixed cost infrastructure  both of which would cause material fluctuations in our gross margins and our operating results 
demand for our products depends primarily on demand in the communications markets 
the majority of our products are incorporated into customers systems in enterprise carrier class network  wireless infrastructure and access network applications 
a smaller percentage of our products also serve in customers computer storage  computer related  and other applications 
customer applications for our products have historically been characterized by rapid technological change and significant fluctuations in demand 
demand for most of our products  and therefore potential increases in revenue  depends upon growth in the communications market  particularly in the data networking and wireless telecommunications infrastructure markets and  to a lesser extent  the computer related markets 
any slowdown in these communications or computer related markets could materially adversely affect our operating results  as most recently evidenced by conditions in fiscal and our results are dependent on the success of new products 
new products and wafer processing technology will continue to require significant r d expenditures 
if we are unable to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  and to sell them at gross margins comparable to or better than our current products  our future results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  our future revenue growth is also partially dependent on our ability to penetrate new markets  where we have limited experience and where competitors are already entrenched 
even if we are able to develop  produce and successfully market new products in a timely manner  such new products may not achieve market acceptance 
we are dependent on a concentrated group of customers for a significant part of our revenues 
we are dependent on a limited number of original equipment manufacturers oems as our end customers  and our future results depend significantly on the strategic relationships we have formed with them 
if these relationships were to diminish  and if these customers were to develop their own solutions or adopt a competitor s solution instead of buying our products  our results could be adversely affected 
for example  any diminished relationship with cisco or other key customers could adversely affect our results 
while we sell essentially nothing to cisco directly  we estimate that when all channels of distribution are considered  cisco represented approximately of our total revenues for fiscal many of our end customer oems have outsourced their manufacturing to a concentrated group of global contract electronic manufacturers cems who then buy product directly from us on behalf of the oem 
cems have achieved greater autonomy in the design win  product qualification and product purchasing decisions  especially for commodity products 
furthermore  these cems have generally been centralizing their global procurement processes 
this has had the effect of concentrating a significant percentage of our revenue with a small number of companies 
competition for the business of these cems is intense and there is no assurance we can remain competitive and retain our existing market share within these customers 
if these companies were to allocate a higher share of commodity or second source business to our competitors instead of buying our products  our results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as these cems represent a growing percentage of our overall business  our concentration of credit and other business risks with these customers has increased 
competition among global cems is intense  they operate on extremely thin margins  and their financial condition  on average  declined significantly during the industry downturn in fy fy if any one or more of these global cems were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business would be adversely impacted as well 
during fiscal  one cem  celestica  accounted for approximately of our revenue during fy and represented approximately of our accounts receivable as of march  finally  we utilize a relatively small number of global and regional distributors around the world  who also buy product directly from us on behalf of their customers 
if our business relationships were to diminish or any one or more of these global distributors were to file for bankruptcy or otherwise experience significantly adverse financial conditions  our business could be adversely impacted 
one distributor  avnet represented of revenues for fiscal our product manufacturing operations are complex and subject to interruption 
from time to time  we have experienced production difficulties  including reduced manufacturing yields or products that do not meet our or our customers specifications  that have caused delivery delays  quality problems  and possibly lost revenue opportunities 
while delivery delays have been infrequent and generally short in duration  we could experience manufacturing problems  capacity constraints and or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  complexity of manufacturing processes  changes to our process technologies including transfers to other facilities and die size reduction efforts  and ramping production and installing new equipment at our facilities 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
we have a wafer fabrication facility in hillsboro  oregon  and assembly and test facilities in the philippines and malaysia 
if we were unable to use our facilities  as a result of a natural disaster or otherwise  our operations would be materially adversely affected 
while we maintain certain levels of insurance against selected risks of business interruption  not all risks can be insured at a reasonable cost 
even if we have purchased insurance  the adverse impact on our business  including both costs and lost revenue opportunities  could greatly exceed the amounts  if any  that we might recover from our insurers 
we are dependent upon electric power generated by public utilities where we operate our manufacturing facilities and we have periodically experienced electrical power interruptions 
we maintain limited backup generating capability  but the amount of electric power that we can generate on our own is insufficient to fully operate these facilities  and prolonged power interruptions could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
historically  we have utilized subcontractors for the majority of our incremental assembly requirements  typically at higher costs than at our own malaysian and philippine assembly and test operations 
we expect to continue utilizing subcontractors to supplement our own production capacity 
due to production lead times and potential subcontractor capacity constraints  any failure on our part to adequately forecast the mix of product demand and resulting subcontractor requirements could adversely affect our operating results 
much of our manufacturing capability is relatively fixed in nature 
much of our manufacturing cost structure remains fixed in nature and large and rapid swings in demand for our products can make it difficult to efficiently utilize this capacity on a consistent basis 
significant downturns  as we have most recently experienced in fiscal  will result in material under utilization of our manufacturing facilities while sudden upturns could leave us short of capacity and unable to capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities 
these swings and the resulting under utilization of our manufacturing capacity or inability to procure sufficient capacity to meet end customer demand for our products will cause material fluctuations in the gross margins we report  and could have a material adverse affect thereon 
we build most of our products based on estimated demand forecasts 
demand for our products can change rapidly and without advance notice 
demand can also be affected by changes in our customers levels of inventory and differences in the timing and order patterns between them and their end customers 
if demand forecasts are inaccurate or change suddenly  we may me be left with large amounts of unsold products  may not be able to fill all orders in the short term and may not be able to accurately forecast capacity utilization or make optimal investment and other business decisions 
this can leave us holding excess and obsolete inventory or unable to meet customer short term demands  either of which can have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate raw materials on a timely basis 
the number of vendors of certain raw materials  such as silicon wafers  ultra pure metals and certain chemicals and gases  is very limited 
in addition  certain packages require long lead times and are available from only a few suppliers 
from time to time  vendors have extended lead times or limited supply to us due to capacity constraints 
although we currently fabricate most of our wafers internally  we are dependent on outside foundries for a small but growing portion of our wafer requirements 
similarly  while we currently conduct most assembly and test operations internally  we do rely upon subcontractors for a significant portion of these back end services 
our results of operations would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner or if there were significant increases in the costs of raw materials  or if foundry or back end subcontractor capacity was not available  or was only available at uncompetitive prices 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and other regulations related to hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to adequately control the use or discharge of hazardous materials under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial costs or liabilities or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended 
intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business and operations 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we have been involved in patent litigation in the past  which adversely affected our operating results 
although we have obtained patent licenses from certain semiconductor manufacturers  we do not have licenses from a number of semiconductor manufacturers that have broad patent portfolios 
claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights have been asserted against us and could be asserted against us in the future 
these claims could result in our having to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  incur significant litigation costs and damages  and develop non infringing technology 
we might not be able to obtain such licenses on acceptable terms or to develop non infringing technology 
further  the failure to renew or renegotiate existing licenses on favorable terms  or the inability to obtain a key license  could materially adversely affect our business 
international operations add increased volatility to our operating results 
a growing and now substantial percentage of our revenues are derived from international sales  as summarized below percentage of total revenues fiscal fiscal fiscal americas asia pacific japan europe total in addition  our assembly and test facilities in malaysia and the philippines  our design centers in canada  china and australia  and our foreign sales offices incur payroll  facility and other expenses in local currencies 
accordingly  movements in foreign currency exchange rates can impact our revenues and costs of goods sold  as well as both pricing and demand for our products 
our offshore sites and export sales are also subject to risks associated with foreign operations  including political instability and acts of war or terrorism  which could disrupt our manufacturing and logistical activities  currency controls and fluctuations  changes in local economic conditions  and changes in tax laws  import and export controls  tariffs and freight rates 
contract pricing for raw materials and equipment used in the fabrication and assembly processes  as well as for foundry and subcontract assembly services  can also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations 
finally  in support of our international operations  a portion of our cash and investment portfolio resides offshore 
at march   we had cash and investments of approximately million invested overseas in accounts belonging to various idt foreign operating entities 
while these amounts are primarily invested in us dollars  a portion is held in foreign currencies  and all offshore balances are exposed to local political  banking  currency control and other risks 
we depend on the ability of our personnel  raw materials  equipment and products to move reasonably unimpeded around the world 
any political  military  world health eg  sars or other issue which hinders this movement or restricts the import or export of materials could lead to significant business disruptions 
furthermore  any strike  economic failure  or other material disruption on the part of major airlines or other transportation companies could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
if such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology  or directly impact our marketing  manufacturing  financial and logistics functions our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to potential impairment charges on investments 
from time to time  we have made strategic investments in other companies  both public and private 
if the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets  we may not benefit from such investments  and we could potentially lose up to all of the amounts we invest 
in addition  we evaluate our portfolio  including non marketable equity securities  on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred 
impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations in any period 
as of march   we carried approximately million  representing one such investment  included in other assets 
our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility 
such volatility may occur in the future  particularly as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of idt  other semiconductor companies  or our customers 
stock price volatility may also result from product announcements by us or our competitors  or from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell 
in addition  our stock price may fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market  especially in the technology sector 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees could adversely affect our business 
in addition  our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical and management personnel 
if we are unable to identify and hire highly qualified technical and managerial personnel  our business could be harmed 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired companies and technologies 
we acquired certain technologies from ibm in fiscal in addition  we acquired newave and solidum in fiscal and  respectively  and we may pursue other acquisitions in the future 
failure to successfully integrate acquired companies and technologies into our business could adversely affect our results of operations 
integration risks and issues may include  but are not limited to  key personnel retention and assimilation  management distraction  technology development  and unexpected costs and liabilities  including goodwill impairment charges 
changes in generally accepted accounting principles regarding stock option accounting may adversely impact our reported operating results  our stock price and our competitiveness in the employee marketplace 
technology companies like ours have a history of using broad based employee stock option programs to recruit  incentivize and retain their workforce in what can be a highly competitive employee marketplace 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas allows companies the choice of either using a fair value method of accounting for options  which would result in expense recognition for all options granted  or using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  with a pro forma disclosure of the impact on net income loss of using the fair value option expense recognition method 
we have elected to apply apb and accordingly we generally do not recognize any expense with respect to employee stock options as long as such options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
during march  the fasb issued a proposed statement  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
the statement proposes to eliminate the treatment for share based transactions using apb and generally would require share based payments to employees be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our statements of operations 
the proposed standard would require the modified prospective method be used  which would require that the fair value of new awards granted from the beginning of the year of adoption plus unvested awards at the date of adoption be expensed over the vesting term 
in addition  the proposed statement encourages companies to use the binomial approach to value stock options  as opposed to the black scholes option pricing model that we currently use for the fair value of our options under sfas disclosure provisions 
the effective date the proposed standard is recommending is for fiscal years beginning after december  should this proposed statement be finalized  it will have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations  as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock options rather than disclosing their impact on our consolidated results of operations within our footnotes in accordance with the disclosure provisions of sfas this will result in lower reported earnings per share which could negatively impact our future stock price  our access to the capital markets  and the effectiveness of current outstanding stock options in retaining key personnel 
in addition  should the proposal be finalized  this could impact our ability or future practice of utilizing broad based employee stock plans to attract  reward  and retain employees  which could also adversely impact our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and a substantial majority of our investment portfolio at the end of fiscal and the end of fiscal had maturities of less than two years 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  a hypothetical move in interest rates would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
by policy  we mitigate the credit risk in our investment portfolio through diversification and adherence to high credit quality rating standards 
we have minimal interest rate risk with respect to debt  since our balance sheet at march  included only million in debt 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk as a result of international sales  assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  and capital purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts to help manage our foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into derivatives for trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for both fiscal and determining that a change in the value of the us dollar would have an insignificant near term impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows
