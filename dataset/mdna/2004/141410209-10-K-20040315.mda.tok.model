item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands  except share and per share data the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth herein 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations on october   in a move to capture additional revenue related to the sale of our aeds  we acquired substantially all the assets and liabilities of complient corporation  the nation s leading independent provider of aed and cpr training and comprehensive aed program management 
corporations  municipalities  schools  government agencies and others who purchase and deploy aeds are required by certain federal and state laws to obtain a medical prescription and have designated personnel trained annually in aed use and cpr by a certified trainer 
traditionally  buyers of aeds have had to arrange for their own training with non profit organizations or off duty paramedics  coordinate their own site assessment and deployment  and assure ongoing compliance with recertification and other regulations 
complient was the first organization of its kind to offer a comprehensive training program that included the management and coordination of all aspects of aed deployment including site surveys  medical direction  web based software for record keeping and aed cpr training with certified trainers on staff covering all states nationwide 
strategically  complient fits well with us and was a logical extension of our core business 
the acquisition provides additional point of sale revenue as well as a recurring revenue opportunity linked to aed sales 
moreover  we believe this will provide us with a significant competitive advantage over our competitors who do not offer comparable programs 
we reduced complient s non trainer staff by approximately one third and have substantially completed the integration of its operations into ours as of december  in  complient generated revenue of approximately million from sales of aeds and related services 
at the end of  we made a strategic decision to discontinue the no cap powerheart crm placement business model in us hospitals in favor of a capital sale model focused on key distribution relationships such as those we entered into in with general electric medical systems and the premier  inc buying group 
in  we adopted the no cap model  whereby we marketed the powerheart to us hospitals directly  and agreed to place powerheart units in a customer s facility  while retaining ownership of the unit  with no upfront capital equipment charge to the customer in exchange for an agreement to purchase our proprietary  disposable defibrillation electrodes monthly or quarterly 
we believed this no cap model would increase the rate of adoption of our aecd crm technology by addressing the capital budget constraints many us hospitals face and would ultimately result in higher levels of recurring revenue from disposable electrodes 
while this model did initially increase adoption of the technology  it has failed to produce the expected levels of revenue required to continue with this business model going forward 
as a result of this strategic change  we incurred a million inventory impairment charge to write down the value of first generation powerheart and powerheart crm in hospital defibrillators in inventory and at certain customer sites 
however  there are a number of customer sites where the technology has been successfully deployed and that are generating sufficient revenue on disposable electrode sales to justify the continuation of this program for those specific customers 
revenue the following is a summary of net revenue by product line change aeds and related accessories and services powerheart in hospital defibrillators and accessories emergency defibrillators  monitors  training products and accessories total net revenue 
table of contents net revenue for the year ended december  increased million or compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our expanding share of the growing worldwide market for aeds 
sales of aed products and related accessories and services  which represented of our total revenue  increased by million  or 
the aed product line  led by the powerheart aed g  continued to be the principal growth driver and was fueled and complemented by the acquisition of complient and the addition of aed cpr training and program management services  which accounted for million of sales in  primarily in the period following the acquisition of complient on october  in addition  we sold million of emergency defibrillators  monitors  training equipment and accessories in compared to million in this decrease of million  or  is due to the fact that we dedicated less resources to our patient monitoring line  which is not part of our core aed and hospital defibrillation markets  and has resulted in a strategic change for to exit the patient monitoring line  along with the training related equipment and supplies product line we acquired from complient 
sales of powerheart crms and related accessories were for compared to in  which represents less than of total revenue in both years 
sales of our powerheart proprietary disposable defibrillation electrodes related to the first generation powerheart and the powerheart crm were for and  for the lack of growth in these in hospital products contributed to the business model change in late discussed earlier under results of operations 
gross margin cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  including an impairment charge of  compared to  for the year ended december  gross margins as a percentage of revenue  including the impairment charge  improved to in from in the improvement was a result of increased sales of higher margin aeds as a percentage of total revenue from in to in  as well as the reduced cost of the aed product line due to significant cost reduction initiatives taken in and the introduction of our new lower cost version powerheart aed g in august operating expenses the following is a summary of operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue change sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization gain on settlement total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by to million for the year ended december   but decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in the absolute dollar increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing activities related to international sales operations  including the establishment of direct sales operations in the u 
k and germany  and increased us sales activities related to the growth of aed related sales  including new sales and marketing expenses related to program management and training services pursuant to the acquisition of complient 
this increase is offset by a decrease in the sales and clinical efforts associated with the powerheart crm in hospital product line 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects our operating leverage and an increasing mix of revenue flowing through lower cost indirect distribution channels 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased compared to in  research and development expenses were of revenue  down from of revenue in the absolute dollar decrease is primarily attributable to i the development and completion of the powerheart crm project in which resulted in higher salaries  bonuses and benefits as well as project design  consulting and materials expenses during and ii the fact that we reallocated resources previously focused on preproduction activities included in research and development expenses in  but now focused on company wide operations which are included in general and administrative in the second half of 
table of contents compared with the first half of shows an increase in research and development expenses directly related to more headcount and project costs associated with the development of a standard crash cart biphasic defibrillator for gems pursuant to a development agreement signed in july an increase in research and development expenditures is expected to continue into based on the anticipated completion date of this project in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses increased million or during the year ended december  compared with as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in this increase was primarily comprised of new expenses  primarily headcount and facilities  related to the complient acquisition  our relocation of corporate headquarters and expansion of corporate  manufacturing and r d facilities in  increased salaries and benefits  depreciation expense and the fact that we reallocated resources previously focused on preproduction activities included in research and development expenses in  but now focused on company wide operations which are included in general and administrative in amortization of intangibles was  for the year ended december   a decrease of or from the  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily the result of certain identifiable intangible assets becoming fully amortized during offset by approximately two months of amortization of intangibles related to the complient acquisition 
interest interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to interest expense of  for the increase was a result of a full year of interest expense and warrant and debt issuance cost amortization in associated with the senior secured promissory notes issued in may year ended december  compared to year ended december  results of operations on september   we acquired survivalink which enabled us to enter the rapidly growing public access defibrillation market and has contributed significantly and positively to the results of our operations 
on november  we acquired a ownership interest in artema which allowed us to gain access to a line of manual emergency defibrillators and patient monitors 
in addition to the new product line  we significantly expanded our international distribution channel through which we were able to sell additional powerheart aeds and crms during we also established our international sales and marketing headquarters in copenhagen  denmark where artema had certain operations 
in  we also made a fundamental shift in the way we market the powerheart crm in the us away from a capital equipment model  where sales of the powerheart were made to a large distributor medtronic physio control  to a recurring revenue business model 
under this model  we market the powerheart directly to us hospitals  and agree to place powerheart units in a customer s facility  while retaining ownership of the unit  with no upfront capital equipment charge  in exchange for an agreement to purchase a specific number of our proprietary  disposable defibrillation electrodes monthly or quarterly 
we believe this model will increase the rate of adoption of our aecd technology by addressing the capital budget constraints many us hospitals face and will ultimately result in higher levels of recurring revenue from disposable electrodes 
revenue net revenue for the year ended december  increased  or to  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our acquisition of survivalink which generated  in powerheart aed and related accessory sales in as compared to  in this increase in aed revenue was largely due to the timing of the survivalink acquisition which we owned for approximately days in in addition  based on our acquisition of artema  we sold approximately million of emergency defibrillators and monitors and related accessories in  as compared to million for the one month we owned the company in sales of powerheart crms and accessories were for the year ended december   a decrease of  or compared to  for the comparable period in  as a result of transitioning from a traditional capital equipment distribution model to our strategy of placing powerheart units at customer locations 
sales of our powerheart proprietary disposable defibrillation electrodes increased or to 
table of contents  for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in  as a result of a greater number of powerheart units in the field generating electrode utilization 
gross margin cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  gross margins as a percentage of revenue improved to in from in including the write down of first generation powerheart inventory 
the improvement was primarily a result of the increase  as a percentage of total revenue  of the higher margin aeds and accessories 
in addition  the cost of goods sold of the powerheart aed decreased approximately throughout the year of operating expenses sales and marketing expenses were  or of revenue for the year ended december   as compared to  or of sales in this increase is attributable to absorbing a full year of sales expenses as compared to three months in including wages  commissions  travel and related expenses  associated with our us direct aed sales force  and the expansion of this sales force from representatives at the end of to at the end of research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for this decrease is attributable to the completion of the powerheart crm project which resulted in lower salaries  bonuses and benefits associated with headcount reductions and reductions in project design  consulting and materials expenses 
in addition  we recorded the recovery of a previously written off note receivable from heartsine technologies  a privately held research and development firm 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over the  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily comprised of increased patent related legal expenses  and increased salaries and benefits  travel  insurance and depreciation expense associated with the full year integration of the survivalink and artema acquisitions 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles was  for the year ended december   an increase of or from the  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from a full year of amortization of intangibles from the survivalink  and artema acquisitions 
these increases were offset by the discontinuation of goodwill amortization as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
interest interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to interest expense of for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to interest expense relating to the survivalink notes  and interest expense and warrant and debt issuance cost amortization associated with the senior debt issued in may of 
liquidity and capital resources december working capital current ratio current assets to current liabilities cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  net inventories short term and long term borrowings 
table of contents the increase in our current ratio and working capital and the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents are primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable and inventories resulting from our market share and revenue growth in at december   our days sales outstanding on accounts receivable dso was approximately days compared to approximately days at december  the increase in our dso is primarily attributable to an increasing mix of revenue flowing through indirect distribution channels which typically have longer payment terms 
we expect our dso in to average around days and expect to move towards that level in the first two quarters of in february  we secured a million line of credit with silicon valley bank 
the line of credit will be used to provide additional working capital  as needed  to fund our continued growth 
this month facility is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and cash and cash equivalents  has an interest rate of the bank s prime rate plus 
with a floor of payable monthly  and requires us to maintain certain financial covenants 
from inception  our sources of funding for operations and mergers and acquisition activity were derived from placements of debt and equity securities 
in  we raised approximately million in a series of private equity placements and through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in may  we entered into a senior note and warrant purchase agreement with investors pursuant to which the investors loaned us million 
we in turn repaid the  plus accrued interest in senior promissory notes relating to the survivalink acquisition 
in september  we raised million in a private equity placement of  shares of our common stock at per share to a small group of institutional and accredited investors 
in connection with this offering  we also issued  five year warrants with an exercise price of per share 
the proceeds from this offering will fund the acceleration of current product development projects associated with the recently announced partnership with gems and for working capital for future strategic initiatives 
in march  we amended the senior note and warrant agreement in order to ease certain financial covenants into to reflect our actual and expected financial results 
in exchange for these modifications  we issued the note holders  additional warrants to purchase shares of common stock at per share 
from inception through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million 
recovery of the company s assets is dependent upon future events  the outcome of which is indeterminable 
additionally  transition to profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the company s cost structure 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased by  or  to  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a  or decrease in our operating loss year to year including the non cash impairment charge in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  increased by to in compared to cash used by investing activities in of this increase was primarily attributable to the refund of cash invested in mrl of  offset by higher property and equipment expenditures and the lifetec and complient acquisitions and related costs in property and equipment purchases increased in primarily due to additional leasehold improvements for our new corporate headquarters in irvine  ca  our new r d facility in lake forest  ca and our expanded manufacturing facility in minnetonka  mn 
some of these leasehold improvements have been reimbursed to us by our landlords and will be accounted for as credits to rent expense over the life of the related leases 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  decreased by  or to  in from  in this decrease was primarily due to the net proceeds of  from the senior secured promissory notes issued  after repayment of the survivalink notes  in offset by the net proceeds received in for the private equity placement of  and an increase in proceeds from the exercises of stock options year to year of  based on meeting our internal sales growth targets  we believe that our current cash balances  combined with net cash that we expect to generate from operations and our unused line of credit of million  will sustain our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional cash to support our operations during the next twelve months  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that the required capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity will not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and this would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business 
for liquidity purposes  we choose to lease our facilities  automobiles  and certain equipment instead of purchasing them 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the following table presents our expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  total less than year years years after years senior secured promissory notes other long term obligations non cancelable operating leases income taxes as of december   the company has research and experimentation credit carry forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these credits begin to expire in for federal purposes and carry forward indefinety for california state purposes 
the company has capital loss carry forwards of approximately million for both federal and state purposes which begin to expire in for federal purposes and carry forward indefinately for state purposes 
the company also has approximately million and million  respectively  of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards which will begin to expire in and  respectively 
the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code sections and and similar state provisions 
the limitations could result in the expiration of our net operating loss carry forwards and research and experimentation credit carry forwards before full utilization 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
the allowance is estimated based on customer compliance with credit terms  the financial condition of the customer  and collection history  where applicable 
additional allowances could be required if the financial condition of our customers were to be impaired beyond our estimates 
valuation of inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventories and maintain an allowance for obsolescence to adjust the carrying value  as necessary  to the lower of cost or market 
the allowance is based on physical and technical functionality as well as other factors affecting the recoverability of the asset through future sales 
unfavorable changes in estimates of obsolete inventory would result in an increase in the allowance and a decrease in gross profit 
goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january   goodwill and other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer subject to amortization but are tested for impairment 
table of contents annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
other intangible assets with finite lives continue to be subject to amortization  and any impairment is determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
should an impairment in goodwill be determined  it could result in a material charge to operations see note and note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on intangibles and amortization periods 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets and intangible assets with determinate lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates potential impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
should the review indicate that the asset is not recoverable  the company s carrying value of the asset would be reduced to its estimated fair value  which is generally measured by future discounted cash flows 
in our estimate  no provision for impairment is currently required on any of our long lived assets 
revenue recognition we record revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that product sales be recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement which states a fixed and determinable price and terms  delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale  and collectibility of the sale is reasonably assured 
we generally record product sales when we have received a valid customer purchase order for product at a stated price  the customer s credit is approved  and we have shipped the product to the customer whereby title and risk have passed to the customer 
some of our customers are distributors which sell goods to third party end users 
we are not contractually obligated to repurchase any inventory from distributors or end user customers 
for certain identified distributors where collection may be contingent on the distributor s resale  revenue recognition is deferred and recognized on a sell through basis 
training and aed service revenue is deferred and recognized at the time the training occurs 
aed program management services pursuant to agreements that existed with complient customers are deferred and amortized straight line over the related contract period 
license fees are generally deferred and recognized systematically over the term of the license agreement 
product warranty products sold are generally covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to five year 
we accrue a warranty reserve to estimate the risk of incurring costs to provide warranty services 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
litigation and others contingencies we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
we are not presently affected by any litigation or other contingencies that have had  or are currently anticipated to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to these contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must generally be both probable and measurable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose it in notes to the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  and ii the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities 
at december   we invested our available cash in money market securities of high credit quality financial institutions 
interest expense on our existing long term debt commitments is based on a fixed interest rate and therefore it is unaffected by fluctuations in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our international sales are made through our international sales office in copenhagen primarily in us dollars 
some sales to the us are in pounds and to germany in euros  and thus may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
additionally  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect foreign demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold 
our operations outside of the united states are maintained in their local currency 
all assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries are translated to us dollars at year end exchange rates in effect during the year 
translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in operations and were not material in any period
