paul walker  jessica alba  ashley scott we may revise the release date of a motion picture as the production schedule changes or in such a manner as we believe is likely to maximize revenues 
additionally  there can be no assurance that any of the motion pictures scheduled for release will be completed  that completion will occur in accordance with the anticipated schedule or budget  or that the motion pictures will necessarily involve all of the creative talent listed above 
see the discussion above in motion picture production 
television production we have in the past engaged in the development and production of episodic television series  mini series and movies for distribution on domestic and international television networks  local independent and network affiliated television stations  pay television networks  basic cable networks and home video 
since the re establishment of our television series production operations in  we have obtained commitments for approximately  hours of television programming  of which approximately six percent remained to be aired as of december  our strategy has been to focus on the development and production of series for cable television and the first run syndication market  which involves a lower production investment risk  and movies and mini series for both network and off network broadcasters 
as part of our strategy  in we entered into a programming arrangement with showtime whereby we provided television series and movies for premiere on showtime 
showtime agreed to license from us exclusive us pay television rights to the following television series a hours six seasons of the outer limits winner of the cable ace award for best dramatic series in and  all of which have aired  b episodes three seasons of poltergeist the legacy  all of which have aired  and c episodes five seasons of stargate sg  all of which have aired 
we have no further commitments from showtime with respect to these series 
following their initial exhibition cycle on showtime  we exploit these programs further in other markets 
in this respect  we entered into a license agreement with usa sci fi channel for the exclusive domestic basic cable exhibition rights of the outer limits  poltergeist the legacy and stargate sg we are producing new episodes of stargate sg for usa sci fi  of which episodes have aired as of december   episodes will be aired in and episodes will be aired in in continuance of this strategy  we have entered into a license agreement with usa sci fi channel with respect to the production of episodes of stargate atlantis  a new one hour action adventure series based on our successful stargate franchise 
ten episodes of stargate atlantis will air in each of and the programming agreement with showtime also included a commitment by showtime to license eight made for television movies from us  none of which remain to be produced as of december  one of the licensed movies  dirty pictures  won the golden globe award for best mini series or motion picture made for television in  giving showtime its first ever victory in that category 
in addition  showtime has committed to licensing three one hour series  the first of which is jeremiah  a one hour action series 
thirty five episodes of jeremiah have been produced  of such episodes have aired as of december   and eight episodes will be aired in the second series is dead like me  which is currently in production 
fifteen episodes of dead like me have aired as of december  showtime has renewed dead like me for its second season  of which episodes will air in the remaining series commitment remains to be produced 
in first run syndication  we launched a new series for the broadcast season called she spies in an arrangement with nbc for station clearances on nbc owned and operated stations 
she spies was renewed for the broadcast season 
forty episodes of the series were produced as of december   and episodes have aired as of december   with ten episodes to be aired in as the risks involved in the first run syndication business have increased significantly in recent years with the advent of mass vertical integration  the resulting consolidation in the marketplace  and the recent downturn in the economy and advertising market  we are evaluating production of series for network television and continuing to focus on cable television 
although network television production typically requires greater deficit financing while offering the potential for greater financial return  we intend to pursue joint ventures  co productions and other partnering arrangements for some of our future series in order to minimize our financial risk 
recently  reality based programming has been an exception to the high deficit high risk network model as networks will typically cover most  if not all  of the production costs of such programming 
although the potential financial return for reality programming is significantly lower than it is for high deficit network programming  we intend to explore this market due to the minimization of financial risk it offers 
in fact  during the summer of  we produced episodes of fame  a one hour reality based series inspired by our feature film for nbc 
our rich film library provides us with a vast resource for developing television production and potential licensing opportunities 
much of our past success has resulted from transforming such library product into successful television franchises  such as in the heat of the night  stargate sg and the outer limits 
currently  we are developing the following projects  among others legally blonde  a one hour series adaptation of our recent hit feature films  barbershop  a half hour series adaptation of our recent hit feature film  and the thomas crown affairs  a one hour adaptation of our popular feature film  for nbc 
in addition  we have licensed the animated cartoon rights in the animated series stargate infinity 
this enables us to share in the creative process while minimizing the financial risks 
stargate infinity had a total of episodes produced for fox kids on saturday mornings  all of which have aired as of december  since our ability to recover production costs and realize profits on our television programs depends on various factors  including but not limited to the programs acceptance by the public  fluctuations in prevailing advertising rates and the ability to distribute the programs subsequent to their first run license  there can be no assurance that we can recover the production costs or realize profits on any television series 
thus  there is a substantial risk that some or all of our television projects will not be commercially successful  resulting in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized 
see distribution and competition 
there is also financial exposure to us after the programming is licensed to the extent that advertising revenues and or license fees we receive are not sufficient to cover production costs 
moreover  we may have certain financial obligations to the producer of a series if we cancel production prior to commencement of production for any broadcast season for which the series was licensed 
distribution theatrical distribution general 
the initial step in the release of a motion picture is the booking of engagements with theatrical exhibitors 
the exhibitors retain a portion of admissions paid at the box office  which generally includes a fixed amount per week  as well as a percentage of the gross receipts that escalates over time 
a studio s or other producer s or third party distributor s share is generally approximately percent of gross box office receipts  although that percentage has generally decreased in recent years and varies depending upon factors such as market competition and the overall performance of the film 
we intend to release a slate of films appealing to a wide variety of audiences 
by strategically timing the release of our motion pictures throughout the year  we seek to avoid some of the risks posed when a motion picture is inappropriately released during the most crowded and competitive box office seasons 
we believe that this strategy is unlikely to have a negative impact on our ability to generate home video rentals 
all motion pictures that we release theatrically in the us and canada  whether produced by mgm pictures  ua films or third parties  are marketed and distributed by mgm distribution co 
in june  we entered into an agreement with fox pursuant to which fox provides distribution services for our films in the international theatrical market 
this distribution services arrangement took effect on november  although fox is servicing international theatrical distribution activities on our behalf  we have reserved broad powers to direct and control the handling and release of our films 
we believe that this arrangement with fox reduces the amount of fixed overhead related to the distribution of our theatrical product in the international marketplace 
co production and distribution agreements 
in addition to producing motion pictures independently  we enter into co production agreements  split rights deals and similar arrangements under which we retain certain distribution rights with respect to a picture and share the cost of production with a partner that obtains other rights 
while such agreements limit our risk relating to a motion picture s performance as they reduce our production costs  such agreements also limit profitability 
we also acquire rights to distribute films through negative pickup arrangements under which we acquire a completed motion picture  or certain rights therein  from a third party 
under co production agreements  split rights deals or negative pickup arrangements  we may be committed to spend specified amounts for prints and advertising 
additionally  we occasionally enter into rent a system arrangements under which we provide distribution services to an independent film company for a percentage distribution fee 
under rent a system arrangements  the independent film company generally is responsible for all print and advertising costs 
these types of arrangements may be entered into before  during or after production of a particular motion picture 
digital distribution 
on march   a wholly owned subsidiary  mgm digital development inc  acquired a one seventh interest in ndc  llc  a partnership created with the six other major studios to a develop and or ratify standards for digital motion picture equipment and for digital cinema technology to be used in the delivery of high quality in theatre digital cinema and b update and deploy a limited amount of new digital motion picture equipment in theatres 
we have contributed million for our equity interest in the joint venture 
the initial term of the agreement has been extended and is now expiring on september  theatrical marketing 
our theatrical marketing department consists of five functional groups research  media planning  advertising  promotion and publicity 
the objective of the marketing department is to maximize each motion picture s commercial potential by designing and implementing a marketing campaign tailored to appeal to the picture s most receptive audience 
the marketing process begins with research before a motion picture is completed 
the research department determines  through audience screenings and focus groups  a motion picture s appeal to its most likely target audience 
the marketing group begins to develop marketing materials well in advance of a motion picture s scheduled theatrical release 
the marketing campaign generally begins six months before release with the circulation of teaser trailers  posters and exhibitor advertising materials 
the campaign becomes more aggressive two to three months before release as full length trailers are released in theaters and additional materials are sent to exhibitors 
finally  a national media campaign is launched four to five weeks before opening day 
this media campaign generally involves advertising a picture s release on national television  including network prime time and syndication markets  national cable and radio and in magazines  newspapers and specific target markets 
in addition  public appearances  such as television talk shows  are arranged for a picture s stars in order to promote the film 
the entire process is managed by our in house staff  although outside agencies are frequently retained to provide certain creative services 
home video distribution our marketing and distribution strategy in the home video market domestically and internationally is to a market our motion picture and television titles in cohesive consumer and retailer promotions  b create branded product lines  c adapt to a maturing vhs market and a growing dvd market and d release new motion pictures into the home entertainment market at the time of the year that we believe will achieve the best results 
in addition to organizing our vhs and dvd product into branded collections  we have launched an integrated sales and marketing branding initiative designed to create awareness for mgm catalog product and to drive store traffic to dedicated displays in key customer outlets 
under the mgm means great movies umbrella message  the general advertising  retailer specific advertising and all in store signage for the mgm dedicated sections are combined to create awareness and demand for mgm catalog titles and to help consumers find them in stores 
additionally  in connection with new films which we release into the market  we often release related library films  or groups of library films  in order to increase sales of both the library films and new releases 
an example is the release of the james bond library titles in connection with the november theatrical release of die another day 
another example is the re promotion of legally blonde in connection with the august theatrical release of legally blonde we intend to continue this strategy of packaging groups of films or film franchises and releasing them in connection with the releases of our most highly visible new films 
furthermore  we have released over mgm dvd titles and now have a critical mass of properties in the marketplace from which we are able to create effective promotions that target the growing dvd consumer base 
mgm home entertainment manages the marketing and distribution of our current feature motion pictures and library product in the home video and other home entertainment markets 
in june  we entered into an agreement with fox pursuant to which fox provides distribution services for our films in the international home video market 
this distribution arrangement became effective on february  on june   we gave notice to fox of our intent to terminate the agreement as of january  as permitted under the agreement 
however  we have negotiated to continue the agreement in a modified form under which fox will continue to provide subdistribution services in certain territories and we will continue to reserve broad powers to direct and control the handling of our home video product 
in  we expanded our sales and marketing operations in western europe  adding france and germany to operations already in place in the uk 
we also added to our north american sales  marketing and distribution operations with the addition of canada to our existing us distribution 
furthermore  by early we plan to have control of all sales  marketing and distribution operations in the uk  france  germany and australia 
from to  we increased our annual worldwide home video gross revenue from feature films from million to  million 
we believe that this increase is in part a result of effective and efficient sales  marketing and distribution of new release and library product and the growth of the dvd market 
in  we continued to focus on developing strong retail relationships and programs that have increased our in store presence 
this presence has  in turn  increased our exposure to the end consumer at retail and has had a positive impact on sales 
furthermore  our retailers have recognized our successful sales and distribution effort 
in  we were named vendor of the year from best buy  an award we also won in we also received the altitunes vendor of the year award and the shopko vendor of the year award for the second consecutive year 
we have entered into revenue sharing agreements for our new releases and certain library titles  pursuant to which we lease titles to rental establishments and receive a percentage of the consumer rental revenues generated from such titles 
although we can provide no assurance  we believe that such arrangements may increase our revenues from the home video rental market by allowing us to participate in increased revenues from successful titles even though these revenues will be received over a longer period 
we intend to continue capitalizing on growing distribution formats such as dvd 
the dvd console installed base in the united states grew from over one million households at the beginning of to a base of approximately million households by the end of we believe that this rapid growth  combined with the strong desire among new dvd owners to create new film collections  will continue to be a source of incremental revenue for us 
our dvd sales have increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately percent 
the increase in dvd sales was partially offset by a drop in videocassette format sales  resulting in an approximate percent increase in worldwide home video sales 
we intend to continue expansion and exploitation of our dvd library product into we also intend to capitalize on emerging distribution technologies such as video on demand  a technology that gives consumers the ability to order and control the playback of a feature film or other property 
as an example  in  we entered into a video on demand joint venture  now named movielink  with four other major studios to distribute our properties 
in  movielink launched a video on demand service over the internet 
the development and or emergence of such distribution technologies  platforms and formats  however  is dependent on the development and rollout of technology  as well as other external factors  and may create new risks to our ability to protect our intellectual property 
see competition 
television distribution general 
we generally license our current theatrical motion pictures for pay television through output agreements pursuant to which films not yet produced are pre licensed for a specified fee paid on delivery 
we believe that output agreements with international distributors with recognized expertise are beneficial 
we intend to enter into relatively short term licenses of our library motion pictures for pay and free television with title selections designed for the relevant marketplace 
we have created a proprietary database for use by our sales force which contains detailed information on each of our films  including dates of availability  media controlled by us  sales history  genre  format  length  stars  soundtrack  etc 
the sales force can utilize this information in order to fulfill customer demand for strategically designed offerings of motion pictures based on one or more criteria 
we believe that this system provides our sales force with an advantage in a competitive marketplace that requires large amounts of diverse content 
domestic pay television 
we have a theatrical motion picture output agreement with showtime requiring our future theatrical motion pictures to air on showtime s pay television network 
we have extended the output term of the agreement with showtime to cover pictures theatrically released in the us commencing january  and continuing until the earlier of december  or the delivery of pictures under the agreement 
we have delivered titles to date 
the license fees for each picture are generally determined according to a formula based on us theatrical rentals of such picture 
in september  we entered into a ten year licensing agreement with starz encore group that includes over  of our library films 
the deal generates a great deal of revenue and cash flow from the library titles and  because the movies will shift in and out of starz encore windows  we will also be able to sell them to other buyers throughout the course of the license term 
domestic free television 
we distribute our feature motion pictures to us and canadian networks  local television stations and basic cable networks in the us and canada 
we also generate revenue by granting syndication licenses on a barter basis 
barter syndication allows the television stations to license our product in exchange for a portion of the local commercial airtime 
we  in turn  sell commercial airtime to advertisers on a national basis  while the television stations retain a portion of the commercial airtime for local advertisers 
we have used outside barter companies to sell television spots to advertisers in the past  but we commenced our own barter sales business in in february  we transitioned our barter sales operations to mgm nbc media sales  llc  a new media sales company formed by mgm domestic television distribution llc and nbc enterprises  inc to act as an agent to sell barter advertising spots received by each company as full or partial consideration from the licensing of feature film and television programming product in the domestic syndication market 
the joint venture recognizes income from fees earned on each company s barter sales and incurs overhead costs to operate the joint venture  which are shared between the companies 
each company is entitled to its share of the net profits or losses of mgm nbc media sales  llc based on a contractual formula as specified in the agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of mgm ua by pathe in november  mgm pathe licensed the domestic free television rights to a substantial portion of its library the ua library and the post mgm ua titles in theatrical release at the time  constituting approximately titles and selected television programs to turner for a period of ten years beginning from the availability of each such product in that market 
the license excludes motion pictures released theatrically beginning in with respect to most of the motion pictures and television programming covered by the turner license  the domestic free television rights revert to us between and we expect to receive relatively little revenue from the licensing of the product covered by the agreement with turner in the domestic free television market until such product reverts to us 
we are currently engaged in negotiations with turner pursuant to which we seek to accelerate the termination of the turner license 
we believe that  due to the significant increases in licensing fees for domestic television since  the expiration of the turner license and our subsequent ability to freely license the library in this market  together with our ability to utilize these titles on mgm branded cable and satellite channels  will generate incremental revenue for us 
see film and television library 
in june  we entered into an agreement with the united paramount network upn to supply one film per week to the network  which is broadcast in its saturday daytime slot 
we sell the network advertising within the films in a revenue sharing arrangement with upn 
in april  upn exercised its first option to renew the agreement for an additional year 
in march  upn exercised its second option to renew the agreement for a third year through september  currently  we are negotiating a new weekly movie agreement 
in april  mgm worldwide television distribution entered into an agreement with the viacom owned television networks  the new tnn the national network now named spike tv  cbs and upn for them to license from us the exclusive us television rights to classic titles from the james bond franchise 
the agreement represents the first time that the three viacom networks  spike tv  cbs and upn  have acquired programming in one cross platform agreement 
in march  we entered into another agreement with those networks for additional bond titles 
in may  effective in july  we entered into an agreement with rainbow media holdings  inc  american movie classics company  we womens entertainment llc and the independent film channel llc for them to license from us approximately library films on an exclusive basis and approximately library films on a non exclusive basis for use on their cable channels 
with respect to the exclusive films  the license provides for twelve month windows of exhibition  which are shorter than customary license windows 
we are also currently negotiating a french language free television canadian output agreement with tos  inc which includes ten library features per year over the next four years 
domestic cable television investment 
on april   we entered into an agreement with cablevision systems corporation  rainbow media holdings  inc and four of rainbow s subsidiaries 
under the agreement  we made an investment aggregating million in two general partnerships owned by rainbow 
as a result  we acquired a percent interest in each of these partnerships effective in april the partnerships own and operate the cable television channels american movie classics  the independent film channel and we women s entertainment formerly known as romance classics and  until recently  bravo 
in december  we sold our percent interest in bravo to a subsidiary of the national broadcasting company  inc for million in cash 
in july  we sold our percent equity interest in the remaining partnerships to cablevision for million 
network television 
in  we launched she spies into syndication with nbc 
the show ran on the nbc network during the summer and in syndication in the fall 
in early  we renewed the series on the nbc stations for a second season and it is now cleared in over percent of the us for season 
international pay and free television 
we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through pay television licenses in over territories 
we have output agreements with licensees in major territories  including germany  france  the united kingdom  italy  japan  latin america and brazil 
financial instability and increased concentration of buyers in foreign television markets  including in european pay television markets  may adversely affect our ability to renew output agreements on favorable terms 
in  we received million in revenue from international pay television distribution  accounting for five percent of our total revenue for the year 
in october  we entered into a new output agreement with premiere  the leading pay television provider in germany and austria 
the new agreement replaces our prior agreement with kirchgruppe  which filed for bankruptcy protection in germany 
the new agreement contains lower license fees but also provides for the launch of an mgm branded channel in germany 
see branded cable and satellite channels 
we currently distribute our motion pictures and television product through free television licenses in over territories 
in  we received million in revenues under these agreements  accounting for nine percent of our total revenues for the year 
these license arrangements typically provide licensees with the right to exhibit the licensed motion pictures on television for a specific number of airings over a period of three to seven years 
in  mgm ua entered into a long term license of free television rights for theatrical  television movies and television series in our library with degeto film germany 
substantially all of the license fees have already been paid to us  and  therefore  we do not expect to receive significant revenues in future periods 
the distribution rights to the motion pictures and television series licensed under the degeto agreement were scheduled to return to us incrementally through effective january  we amended the degeto agreement to reclaim non exclusive pay television rights in germany to the approximately titles subject to the license 
in exchange  we agreed to extend degeto s now non exclusive license periods on a majority of the licensed titles by approximately months beyond the original end dates for those titles 
this agreement with degeto now provides us with an opportunity to generate incremental revenue in germany s pay television market 
see film and television library 
additionally  orion entered into certain long term licenses covering a significant number of its library motion pictures in the international free and pay television markets 
orion had already received substantially all of the license fees under these licenses  prior to our acquisition of orion  and therefore  we do not expect significant revenue from these licenses in future periods 
orion licensed titles to capitol film and tv international germany  compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion france  film finance group  inc  principal network limited italy  mitsubishi corporation japan and televisio de catalunya  sa spain 
the distribution rights granted to capitol film and tv international originally reverted to orion in in  we negotiated the early return of titles under license to capitol film tv international for german speaking europe  which gives us the opportunity to receive additional incremental license fees for the titles 
the majority of distribution rights granted to compagnie luxembourgeoise de telediffusion revert to orion between and the distribution rights granted to film finance group  inc and principal network limited revert to orion through the distribution rights granted to televisio de catalunya  sa currently are reverting to orion  with such reversion being complete in we believe that  due to the importance of france  spain  japan and italy and the significant increases in licensing fees for television in these markets since  the expiration of these licenses and our subsequent ability to freely license our library in these markets could create substantial incremental revenue 
in march  we entered into an innovative  multi year alliance with nbc enterprises syndication which was extended in january  under which we will provide distribution services for certain nbc studios programming across all territories outside of north america 
we handle the sales and distribution of all of nbc studios current and future series and movies for television  including the prime time series crossing jordan and will grace and the new series las vegas  american dreams and happy family 
also included in the pact are a library component  made for television movies  mini series  soap operas and specials

stargate infinity aired on fox network saturday mornings 
all the episodes aired by december  branded cable and satellite channels 
we believe that pursuing our strategy of providing strategically pooled  branded mgm programming through the licensing of television channels to cable and satellite operators  as well as through the development of new channels of distribution that deliver our programming  will provide opportunities in the international marketplace as foreign countries continue to develop cable and satellite television infrastructures 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financing that may be necessary for such acquisitions or investments  that we will consummate such transactions or that we will be able to realize any anticipated benefits from any such transactions

trademarks and consumer products we own a portfolio of over  trademark registrations around the world for such venerable trademarks as metro goldwyn mayer  mgm  the mgm lion logo  united artists  ua  orion  cannon  and variations thereof 
we also own or control trademarks and characters associated with motion pictures and television series we produced and or distributed  such as the pink panther and rocky 
in  we realized over million in revenue from the licensing of these trademarks and characters  including interactive media products 
the mgm name and the mgm lion logo are among the most recognized trademarks in the world  and have for over years designated the source of the highest quality entertainment related goods and services 
we believe these trademarks represent assets of which the value has been substantially unrealized in the past 
we plan to pursue a focused branded strategy that will capitalize on our name and logo  and to seek licensing opportunities for such name and logo  as well as our other trademarks  in a wide range of product categories and distribution channels 
in february  our predecessor in interest granted to a predecessor in interest of mgm mirage an exclusive open ended royalty free license to use the trademark mgm  as well as certain stylized lion depictions  in its resort hotel and or gaming businesses and other businesses not related to filmed entertainment 
this license was amended in in june  the license was further amended to allow mgm mirage to use the trademark mgm in combination with the trademark mirage to the same extent that it was permitted theretofore with regard to the mgm grand trademarks 
in consideration of this further grant of rights  mgm mirage has agreed to pay an annual license fee of million 
mgm mirage paid us million in advance in june  million in july  million in july and million in july subsequent annual payments are due on each anniversary date thereafter 
we are presently engaged in discussions with mgm mirage to clarify certain terms of the license and separate ownership of the mgm mirage trademarks from our trademarks 
a committee of our board of directors consisting of frank mancuso  an mosich and priscilla presley has been formed to supervise these negotiations and decide whether and on what terms to amend the trademark license 
in december  pursuant to a merchandise license agreement  we granted a subsidiary of mgm mirage the right to use certain of our trademarks and logos in connection with the retail sale of merchandise at mgm mirage s properties 
we are to receive royalties based on retail sales of the licensed merchandise 
the agreement has a term of five years  subject to the mgm mirage s right to extend the term for one additional five year period and its option to terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice 
competition motion picture production and distribution are highly competitive businesses 
we face competition from companies within the entertainment business  as well as alternative forms of leisure entertainment 
we compete with the other major studios  numerous independent motion picture and television production companies  television networks and pay television systems for the acquisition of literary properties  the services of performing artists  directors  producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing 
numerous organizations with which we compete in the motion picture industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm  while the independent production companies may have less overhead than mgm 
most of the other major studios are part of large  diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations  including television networks and cable channels  which can provide both means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that offset the fluctuations in the financial performance of their motion picture and television operations 
see distribution television distribution 
in addition  our motion pictures compete for audience acceptance and exhibition outlets with motion pictures produced and distributed by other companies 
as a result  the success of any of our motion pictures is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular picture  but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time 
the number of films released by our competitors  particularly the other major film studios  in any given period may create an oversupply of product in the market  thereby potentially reducing our share of gross box office admissions and making it more difficult for our films to succeed 
competition is also intense within the television industry 
there are numerous suppliers of television programming  including the networks  the television production divisions of the major studios and independent producers  all of which compete actively for the limited number of available broadcast hours 
our programming competes with first run programming  network reruns and programs produced by local television stations 
competition is also intense in supplying motion pictures and other programming for the pay television and home video markets 
numerous organizations with which we compete in the television industry have significantly greater financial and other resources than mgm 
the entertainment industry in general  and the motion picture and television industry in particular  are continuing to undergo significant changes  primarily due to technological developments 
for example  as motion pictures begin to be distributed using emerging technologies such as the internet and online services  the ability to protect intellectual property rights in motion pictures will be threatened by advances in technology that enable digital piracy 
this is because digital formats currently do not contain mechanisms for tracking the source or ownership of digital content 
as a result  users may be able to download and distribute unauthorized or pirated copies of copyrighted motion pictures over the internet 
in addition  there could be increased proliferation of devices capable of making unauthorized copies of motion pictures 
as long as pirated content is available to download digitally  many consumers may choose to digitally download such pirated motion pictures rather than paying for legitimate motion pictures 
digital piracy of our films may adversely impact the gross receipts received from the exploitation of such films 
due to this rapid growth of technology and with it  piracy  as well as shifting consumer tastes and the popularity and availability of other forms of entertainment  it is impossible to predict the overall effect these factors will have on the potential revenue and profitability of feature length motion pictures and television programming 
employees and labor matters as of december   we had approximately  full time and part time regular employees in our worldwide operations 
of that total  approximately were primarily engaged in production and development  approximately were primarily engaged in sales  marketing and distribution and approximately were primarily engaged in management and administration 
approximately of our employees are currently covered by employment contracts 
we also hire additional employees on a picture by picture basis in connection with the production of our motion pictures and television programming 
the salaries of these additional employees  as well as portions of the salaries of certain full time employees who provide direct production services  are typically allocated to the capitalized cost of the related motion pictures or television programming 
we believe that our employee and labor relations are good 
approximately of our current employees and many of the employees or independent contractors that we hire on a project by project basis are represented under industry wide collective bargaining agreements with various unions  including the writers guild of america  the directors guild of america  the screen actors guild and the international alliance of theatrical stage employees 
the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios  and the other major studios in the united states  generally employ actors  writers and directors who are members of the screen actors guild  writers guild of america and directors guild of america  pursuant to industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
the collective bargaining agreement with the writers guild of america expires on may  and the collective bargaining agreement with the screen actors guild expires on june  negotiations for new agreements with the screen actors guild have commenced and with the writers guild of america are expected to commence in the near future 
the directors guild of america collective bargaining agreement expires on june  many productions also employ members of a number of other labor organizations including  without limitation  the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees and the international brotherhood of teamsters 
the collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which represents significant numbers of persons within the motion picture and television industry  expires on july  and the collective bargaining agreement with the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees expires on july  a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities 
such a halt or delay  depending on the length of time involved  could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues 
our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent  if any  that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their first run programming 
regulation in  the us was unable to reach agreement with its major international trading partners to include audiovisual works  such as television programs and motion pictures  under the terms of the world trade organization 
the failure to include audiovisual works under gatt allows many countries including members of the european union  which currently consists of austria  belgium  denmark  germany  greece  finland  france  ireland  italy  luxembourg  the netherlands  portugal  spain  sweden and the united kingdom to continue enforcing quotas that restrict the amount of us produced television programming which may be aired on television in such countries 
the european union council of ministers has adopted a directive requiring all member states of the european union to enact laws specifying that broadcasters must reserve  where practicable  a majority of their transmission time exclusive of news  sports  game shows and advertising for european works 
the directive must be implemented by appropriate legislation in each member country 
under the directive  member states remain free to require broadcasters under their jurisdiction to comply with stricter rules 
for example  france requires that original french programming constitute a required portion of all programming aired on french television 
these quotas apply only to television programming 
several countries including france  italy and korea also have quotas on the theatrical exhibition of motion pictures 
we cannot assure you that additional or more restrictive theatrical or television quotas will not be enacted or that countries with existing quotas will not more strictly enforce such quotas 
additional or more restrictive quotas or more stringent enforcement of existing quotas could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to exploit fully our motion pictures internationally 
distribution rights to motion pictures are granted legal protection under the copyright laws of the us and most foreign countries  which laws provide substantial civil and criminal sanctions for unauthorized duplication and exhibition of motion pictures 
we seek to take appropriate and reasonable measures to secure  protect and maintain or obtain agreements to secure  protect and maintain copyright protection for all of our motion pictures or television programming under the laws of applicable jurisdictions 
motion picture piracy is an international as well as a domestic problem 
motion picture piracy is extensive in many parts of the world  including south america  asia including korea  china and taiwan  the countries of the former soviet union and other former eastern bloc countries 
in addition to the mpaa  the motion picture association  the american film marketing association and the american film export association monitor the progress and efforts made by various countries to limit or prevent piracy 
in the past  these various trade associations have enacted voluntary embargoes of motion picture exports to certain countries in order to pressure the governments of those countries to become more aggressive in preventing motion picture piracy 
in addition  the us government has publicly considered trade sanctions against specific countries which do not take steps to prevent copyright infringement of us produced motion pictures 
there can be no assurance that voluntary industry embargoes or us government trade sanctions will be enacted 
if enacted  such actions could impact the amount of revenue that we realize from the international exploitation of our motion pictures depending upon the countries subject to such action and the duration and effectiveness of such action 
if not enacted or if other measures are not taken  the motion picture industry including mgm may continue to lose an indeterminate amount of revenues as a result of motion picture piracy 
the code and ratings administration of the mpaa assigns ratings indicating age group recommendations for theatrical distribution of motion pictures 
we have followed and will continue to follow the practice of submitting our pictures for such ratings 
as a substantial number of our films are rated r  under rules which are the theatrical exhibitors responsibility to enforce  children under may attend the applicable motion picture only if accompanied by an adult 
united states television stations and networks as well as foreign governments impose content restrictions on motion pictures that may restrict in whole or in part exhibition on television or in a particular territory 
there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not limit or alter our ability to exhibit certain motion pictures in such media or markets 
by letter dated november   we received a request from the department of justice for a voluntary production of information and documents relating to our movielink video on demand joint venture with four other major studios

recent developments dutch auction tender offer 
on december  we commenced a dutch auction tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a purchase price not greater than nor less than per share 
under the procedures for the dutch auction tender offer  our stockholders had the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares of common stock at prices specified by the stockholders 
we then determined the lowest price per share within the range of to per share that would enable us to buy  shares  or such lesser number of shares that are properly tendered and not withdrawn 
all shares accepted in the dutch auction tender offer were purchased by us at the same determined price per share regardless of whether the stockholders tendered at a lower price 
tracinda and kirk kerkorian  our principal stockholders  did not participate in the dutch auction tender offer  nor did any members of our board of directors or executive management 
the dutch auction tender offer expired on january  pursuant to the dutch auction tender offer  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of per share  or an aggregate amount of million  plus offering expenses of approximately million 
the dutch auction tender offer was financed primarily from available cash on hand  net cash flow provided by operating activities and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources 
following completion of the dutch auction tender offer  mr

under the terms of the shareholders agreement  we paid certain expenses of the offering aggregating approximately million 
on october   mr

however  we have negotiated to continue the agreement in a modified form under which fox will continue to provide subdistribution services in certain territories and we will continue to reserve broad powers to direct and control the handling of our home video product 
sales of equity interests in rainbow media cable channels 
on december   we sold our percent ownership interest in bravo to an affiliate of the national broadcasting company for million cash 
we reported a gain on the sale of bravo of million in the year ended december  on july   we sold our percent equity interest in the rainbow media cable channels american movie classics  the independent film channel and we women s entertainment to cablevision systems corporation for million 
we received million cash and a million promissory note that matures five months from the closing date 
the promissory note requires monthly payments of million and bears interest at libor  as defined  plus percent 
the company collected the remaining balance of the note in cash on december  as our investment in these cable channels exceeded the net selling price  we reported a write down of approximately million of our investment in the cable channels 
sources of revenue the principal sources of motion picture industry revenue are the domestic and international distribution of motion pictures  including theatrical exhibition  home entertainment and television pay per view  pay  network  syndication and basic cable 
over the last decade  the relative contributions of these components of revenues have changed dramatically 
although revenues from domestic theatrical distribution have increased  growth in total motion picture industry revenues has resulted predominantly from increased revenues derived from the distribution of motion pictures internationally as well as from other media and distribution channels 
our feature films are exploited through a series of sequential domestic and international distribution channels  typically beginning with theatrical exhibition 
thereafter  feature films are first made available for home video generally six months after theatrical release  for pay television  one year after theatrical release  and for syndication  approximately three to five years after theatrical release 
our television programming is produced for initial broadcast on either pay  syndicated or network television in the united states  followed by international territories and  in some cases  worldwide video markets 
we distribute our motion picture and television productions in foreign countries and  in recent years  have derived approximately to percent of our revenues from foreign sources 
approximately percent of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  we incur certain operating and production costs in foreign currencies 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we  in certain instances  enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
these contracts generally mature within one year 
we do not enter into foreign currency contracts for speculative purposes 
realized gains and losses on contracts that hedge anticipated future cash flows were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
we had foreign currency exchange contracts relating to million canadian dollars and million pounds sterling or the equivalent million outstanding at december  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cost structure general 
in the motion picture industry  the largest component of the cost of producing a motion picture generally is the negative cost  which includes the above the line and below the line costs of producing the film 
above the line costs are costs related to the acquisition of picture rights and the costs associated with the producer  the director  the writer and the principal cast 
below the line costs are the remaining costs involved in producing the picture  such as film studio rental  principal photography  sound and editing 
distribution expenses consist primarily of the costs of advertising and preparing release prints 
the costs of advertising associated with a major domestic theatrical motion picture release are significant and typically involve national and target market media campaigns  as well as public appearances of a film s stars 
these advertising costs are separate from the advertising costs associated with other domestic distribution channels and the international market 
the major studios generally fund production costs from cash flow generated by motion picture and related distribution activities or bank and other financing methods 
over the past decade  expenses in the motion picture industry have increased rapidly as a result of increased production costs and distribution expenses 
see item business the motion picture and television industry motion picture production 
additionally  each of the major studios must fund substantial overhead costs  consisting primarily of salaries and related costs of the production  distribution and administrative staffs  as well as facilities costs and other recurring overhead 
collective bargaining agreements 
the motion picture and television programs produced by mgm studios  and the other major studios in the united states  generally employ actors  writers and directors who are members of the screen actors guild  writers guild of america and directors guild of america  respectively  pursuant to industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
the collective bargaining agreement with the writers guild of america expires on may  and the collective bargaining agreement with the screen actors guild expires on june  negotiations for new agreements with the screen actors guild have commenced  and negotiations with the writers guild of america are expected to commence in the near future 
the directors guild of america collective bargaining agreement expires on june  many productions also employ members of a number of other labor organizations including  without limitation  the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees and the international brotherhood of teamsters 
the collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which represents significant numbers of persons within the motion picture and television industry  expires on july  and the collective bargaining agreement with the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees expires on july  a strike by one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of motion pictures or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities 
such a halt or delay  depending on the length of time involved  could cause delay or interruption in our release of new motion pictures and television programs and thereby could adversely affect our cash flow and revenues 
our revenues from motion pictures and television programs in our library should not be affected and may partially offset the effects of a strike to the extent  if any  that television exhibitors buy more library product to compensate for interruption in their first run programming 
significant accounting practices beginning january  we adopted new accounting rules see new accounting pronouncements below which require  among other changes  that exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing costs  be expensed as incurred 
theatrical print costs are amortized over the periods of theatrical release of the respective territories 
under accounting rules in effect for periods prior to january   such costs were capitalized as a part of film costs and amortized over the life of the film using the individual film forecast method 
the current practice dramatically increases the likelihood of reporting losses upon a film s theatrical release  but will provide for increased returns when a film is released in the ancillary markets of home video and television  when we incur a much lower proportion of advertising costs 
additional provisions under the new accounting rules include changes in revenue recognition and accounting for development costs and overhead  and reduced amortization periods for film costs 
accounting for motion picture and television costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and industry practice  we amortize the costs of production  including capitalized interest and overhead  as well as participations and talent residuals  for feature films and television programming using the individual film forecast method under which such costs are amortized for each film or television program in the ratio that revenue earned in the current period for such title bears to management s estimate of the total revenues to be realized from all media and markets for such title 
all exploitation costs  including advertising and marketing costs  are expensed as incurred 
theatrical print costs are amortized over the periods of theatrical release of the respective territories 
management regularly reviews  and revises when necessary  its total revenue estimates on a title by title basis  which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and or a write down of the film or television asset to estimated fair value 
these revisions can result in significant quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations in film write downs and amortization 
a typical film or television program recognizes a substantial portion of its ultimate revenues within the first two years of release 
by then  a film has been exploited in the domestic and international theatrical markets and the domestic and international home video markets  as well as the domestic and international pay television and pay per view markets  and a television program has been exploited on network television or in first run syndication 
a similar portion of the film s or television program s capitalized costs should be expected to be amortized accordingly  assuming the film or television program is profitable 
the commercial potential of individual motion pictures and television programming varies dramatically  and is not directly correlated with production or acquisition costs 
therefore  it is difficult to predict or project a trend of our income or loss 
however  the likelihood that we report losses  particularly in the year of a motion picture s release  is increased by the industry s method of accounting which requires the immediate recognition of the entire loss through increased amortization in instances where it is estimated the ultimate revenues of a motion picture or television program will not recover our capitalized costs 
on the other hand  the profit of a profitable motion picture or television program must be deferred and recognized over the entire revenue stream generated by that motion picture or television program 
this method of accounting may also result in significant fluctuations in reported income or loss  particularly on a quarterly basis  depending on our release schedule  the timing of advertising campaigns and the relative performance of individual motion pictures or television programs 
equity investments 
we are accounting for our investment in cable channels in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 management continually reviews its equity investments to determine if any impairment has occurred 
if  in management s judgment  an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings 
such determination is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances  including the financial condition of the investee  subscriber demand and growth  demand for advertising time and space  the intent and ability to retain the investment  and general economic conditions in the areas in which the investee operates

anticipated needs 
our current strategy and business plan call for substantial ongoing investments in the production of new feature films and television programs 
furthermore  we may wish to continue to make investments in new distribution channels to further exploit our motion picture and television library 
we plan to continue to evaluate the level of such investments in the context of the capital available to us and changing market conditions 
currently  we would require additional sources of financing if we decided to make any additional significant investments in new distribution channels 
we believe that the amounts available from cash on hand  the unused portion of our revolving facility  and from operating cash flow will be adequate for us to conduct our operations in accordance with our business plan for at least the next months 
this belief is based in part on the assumption that our future releases will perform as planned 
any significant decline in the performance of our films could adversely impact our cash flows and require us to obtain additional sources of funds 
in addition to the foregoing sources of liquidity  we are currently considering various film financing alternatives 
if necessary in order to manage our cash needs  we may also delay or alter production or release schedules or seek to reduce our aggregate investment in new film and television production costs 
there can be no assurance that any such steps would be adequate or timely  or that acceptable arrangements could be reached with third parties if necessary 
in addition  although these steps would improve our short term cash flow and  in the case of partnering  reduce our exposure should a motion picture perform below expectations  such steps could adversely affect long term cash flow and results of operations in subsequent periods 
we intend to continue to consider either growing into or becoming part of a larger  vertically integrated organization 
in connection with our pursuit of these options  we may consider various strategic alternatives  such as business combinations with companies with strengths complementary to those of ours  other acquisitions and joint ventures  as opportunities arise 
the nature  size and structure of any such transaction could require us to seek additional financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as a result of our variable rate long term debt 
historically  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
as of february   the outstanding balance of million under our revolving facility was exposed to interest rate risk 
we will continue to evaluate strategies to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
we are subject to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because approximately percent of our revenues are denominated  and we incur certain operating and production costs  in foreign currencies 
in certain instances  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks
