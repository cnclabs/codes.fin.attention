see forward looking statements above for additional information 
the following discusses the financial condition and results of operations of southwest water company and subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview southwest water company and subsidiaries southwest water  we us  our or the company  provide a broad range of services including water production and distribution  wastewater collection and treatment  public works services  utility customer billing services and construction management 
we provide services to more than two million people in states 
our business is segmented into two operating groups  our services group and our utility group 
our services group operates our contract service businesses in which we operate and maintain water supply and wastewater facilities owned by cities  public agencies  municipal utility districts and private entities primarily in texas  new mexico  california  colorado  alabama  mississippi and georgia 
while state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations  our services group prices are not subject to regulation 
we also provide utility submetering and billing and collection services in numerous states 
our utility group owns and operates public water and wastewater utilities in california  new mexico and texas 
state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations 
the rates that our regulated utility subsidiaries charge for water and wastewater services are established by state authorities 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated years ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue amounts in millions revenues services group utility group expenses operating expenses services group operating expenses utility group selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense interest expense interest income gain on sales of land other income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to revenues services group services group revenue represents fees earned for water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services  equipment maintenance and repair  sewer pipeline cleaning  billing and collection services  public works and state certified water and wastewater laboratory analysis 
our services group also facilitates the design  construction  project management  and operating aspects of various water and wastewater projects 
services group revenues for increased approximately million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase is due to the following the acquisition of aqua services in november in november  we acquired certain contract operations of aqua source  inc  a provider of contract water and wastewater services in texas  colorado and south dakota 
upon closing of the transaction we began operating the majority of this business under the name aqua services  lp aqua services while the remaining part was incorporated into one of our existing subsidiaries  eco resources  inc eco 
revenues from aqua services were approximately million and million during and  respectively 
an increase in revenues of approximately million from the construction of a reverse osmosis water treatment facility in california to million during from million in an increase in revenues from our texas service operations of approximately million to million during from million during the prior year 
the revenue increase is largely attributable to increased tapping and inspection revenue driven by real estate development activity in texas 
utility group utility group revenue represents fees earned for the production and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of sewage for residential  business  industrial and public authority use 
revenues in the utility group increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the favorable effect of rate increases in our california and texas utilities and increased customer connections in our new mexico and texas utilities 
the effect of increases in rates was partially offset by decreases in water consumption due to variations in weather in our california utility 
the changes are represented as follows in millions favorable effect of rate increase in revenues favorable effect of increase in connections reduction in water consumption net increase in revenue operating expenses services group operating expenses services group represent salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
operating expenses services group represented approximately and of the services group revenues for and  respectively 
operating expenses increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the increase was due to the following the acquisition of aqua services in november  which generated operating costs of approximately million and million during and  respectively  and costs related to the construction of a reverse osmosis water treatment facility for the city of san juan capistrano  california which accounted for approximately million of the increase in operating expenses 
the remaining increase of approximately million for  compared to the prior year  resulted from increased operations and construction activity in the services group s operations 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues in was primarily due to the company s project to construct and operate the reverse osmosis water treatment facility 
we are accounting for the project under the percentage of completion method during the construction phase 
the construction phase is expected to be completed in utility group operating expenses utility group represent the costs of purchasing and producing water  treating wastewater  salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
operating expenses utility group represented approximately and of revenues from utility operations for and  respectively 
operating expenses were substantially unchanged from to the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to the aforementioned increase in utility group revenues  which was primarily due to an increase in rates at our california utility 
operating expenses for our utility group increased million  or  to million during  from million during operating expenses incurred by our new mexico utility increased  or  during as compared to the city of albuquerque has increased sewage treatment rates approximately 
in addition  our new mexico utility has incurred additional fuel costs due to increased volume 
as expected  operating expenses at our california and texas utilities did not change in a significant amount 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of costs related to personnel  facilities  insurance and professional services  which support our sales  marketing  human resources  finance and administration functions 
selling general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for from million during the prior year 
the increase was largely due to the inclusion of approximately million from aqua services and the increased costs company wide for employee health benefits  insurance and compensation expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in other income expense interest expense the major components of interest expense for and are as follows for the year ended december  in millions interest expense convertible subordinate debentures interest expense bank lines of credit interest expense mortgage bonds and bank term loan interest expense other total interest expense before capitalized interest capitalized interest total interest expense we increased borrowings during the first six months of to finance capital improvements in our utility group 
our benefit from lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest from increased construction activity in our utility group was offset by higher borrowings on our bank lines of credit and increased interest expense related to our texas utility bank term loan 
in august  one of our texas utilities obtained a year  million secured bank term loan which increased our long term debt outstanding and consequently  our interest expense 
our effective interest rates for and were and  respectively 
gains on sales of land in the second quarter of  we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land  and in the second quarter of we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land

there were no similar pension related gains in included in other income for is a million agreement reached among parties responsible for the contamination  the cooperating respondents  and our california utility regarding water quality related expenses incurred in  and see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in and subsequent years  such reimbursements will be recorded as a reduction to operating expenses utilities 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was approximately compared to approximately for our effective tax rate for reflected the benefit of a one time gain on the termination of a pension plan  which was excluded from ordinary taxable income 
compared to revenues services group services group revenues increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase is due to the following we acquired optech in august and had the benefit of revenues earned by optech for a full year during versus a partial year in revenues recorded by optech during the period august  through december  and during the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  approximately million in revenues from the acquisition of aqua services in november of  and an increase of approximately million of o m revenues due to the origination of contracts with new customers and expansion of services with existing customers 
utility group utility group revenues increased million  or  to million during from million during revenues at our california utility increased million or to million in from million in the number of water connections served by our california utility remained relatively stable at  and  at december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue recorded by our california utility was due to increased consumption driven by hot  dry weather in  which was one of the driest years in recent history 
revenues at our new mexico utility increased million or to million in from million in connections served by our new mexico utility increased to  at december  from  at december   an increase of approximately 
however  the increase was partially offset by a reduction in per customer volume due to changes in weather 
revenues at our texas utilities increased approximately million or to million during from million during the increase is primarily due to an increase in volume and consistent with the increase in connections to  at december  from  at december  operating expenses services group operating expenses services group represented approximately of the services group revenues for and  respectively 
operating expenses increased approximately million  or  to million during from million during the increase was due to the following the acquisition of aqua services 
in november  which generated operating costs of approximately million during operating costs related to the optech acquisition during the period august  through december  were million compared to costs of million incurred during the year ended december  an increase of approximately million of operating expense due to the origination of contracts with new customers and expansion of services with existing customers 
utility group operating expenses utility group represented approximately and of revenues from utility operations for and  respectively 
operating expenses for our utility group increased million  or  to million during  from million during the increase in operating expenses incurred by our california utility was million to million during from million during the increase in operating expenses for our california utility was due to increased water production driven by hot  dry weather in volume related costs were million greater in than we had to purchase additional water from higher priced sources in order to address the overall increase in demand 
however  the increased water costs were partially offset by the recoveries from cooperating respondents 
in addition  in  our california utility was able to defer recognizing certain costs of approximately million until future rate cases through the use of a balancing account 
as of november   the cpuc eliminated the use of balancing accounts  which had the effect of increasing operating expense for operating expenses incurred by our new mexico utility increased  or  to million during from million during the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of connections served by our new mexico utility 
in addition  the city of albuquerque allowed our new mexico utility to increase sewage treatment rates it charged in operating expenses for our texas utilities increased approximately to million during from million during the increase is primarily due to an increase in volume and is consistent with the increase in connections to  at december  from  at december  selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million during  compared to million for as a percentage of consolidated revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to i the acquisition of optech in august  ii the acquisition of aqua services in november  iii increases in medical and general insurance costs  iv marketing and new business development expenses and v an increase in stock based compensation expense  of million to million in in addition  due to changes in the company s stock price  options issued in were calculated to have a higher per option value than the options issued in other income expense interest expense total interest expense increased to million during  compared to million in the increase reflects interest expense on our year convertible subordinate debentures that were issued in july this increase was partially offset by decreases in the interest expense on our bank lines of credit because we paid down a portion of our line of credit borrowing with the proceeds from the debentures 
the interest expense on the bank lines of credit also decreased due to generally lower interest rates in compared to the effective interest rates on our indebtedness were approximately and in and  respectively 
the reduction in capitalized interest during  compared to the prior year  was due primarily to a reduction in company financed utility projects 
the major components of interest expense for and were as follows for the years ended december  in millions interest expense convertible subordinate debentures interest expense bank lines of credit interest expense mortgage bonds and bank term loan interest expense other total interest expense before capitalized interest capitalized interest total interest expense other we report material events that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently  but not both  in other income expense rather than in operating income  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
reporting the results of operations 
included in other income on the company s consolidated statements of income is the effect of a one time  non taxable gain in of approximately million resulting from the termination of the company s defined benefit pension plan as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in other income for is a million settlement reached between parties responsible for the contamination and our california utility regarding water quality related expenses incurred in  and income taxes our effective tax rate for was approximately compared to approximately for our effective tax rate for was reduced when we recorded a one time gain on termination of a pension plan  which is excluded from ordinary taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided approximately million in cash during consisting of net income of million  adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million  deferred income taxes of million and stock based compensation of million 
operating cash flow was further increased by a net increase in liabilities of million 
operating cash flow was reduced by i an increase in accounts receivable of million  ii an increase in other assets of million  iii a gain of million from the sale of land  and iv an increase in restricted cash of million and v approximately million in other items 
the million increase in trade accounts receivable was due to the following approximately million represents the excess of amounts earned over the amounts collected in connection with the company s million project to design and build a reverse osmosis water treatment plant for the city of san juan capistrano  california 
our california utility made a general rate case filing on april  and was granted an average increase in rates 
approximately million of the accounts receivable increase was due to the increase in monthly revenue as a result of the rate increase 
our investing activities used cash of million during capital expenditures of million were primarily for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment for regulated water system assets used by our utility group  including new wells and transmission lines and the construction of a lift station and water line in texas 
the effect of these expenditures was partially offset by proceeds from sales of land of approximately million 
the following table summarizes our activity for additions to property  plant and equipment during and for the years ended december  in millions company financed additions capital improvement reimbursements contributions paid for by developers total cash additions to property  plant and equipment property contributed by developers total additions to property  plant and equipment financing activities provided cash of approximately million 
net proceeds from our private placement of equity in may were approximately million 
we collected approximately million in net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from asset sale leaseback arrangements were approximately million 
reimbursements to our california utility under an expense reimbursement agreement were approximately million 
contributions in aid of construction ciac represent contributions in the form of cash  services or property received from developers  governmental agencies  municipalities or individuals for the purpose of constructing utility plant 
ciac and advances for construction were approximately million 
cash used to reduce debt and to pay dividends was approximately million and million  respectively 
our liquidity is influenced primarily by cash flows from operations and by capital expenditures at our utility group for the addition  replacement and renovation of water and wastewater utility facilities 
our capital resources are used for debt service on our bonds and debentures and are also influenced by investments in new business opportunities  including the acquisition of companies and acquisition of contract operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial conditions  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations a summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is as follows year ending december  and thereafter total in thousands long term debt bank lines of credit   bank term loan   economic development revenue bonds  mortgage bonds    convertible subordinate debentures  notes payable     advances for construction obligations under non cancellable operating leases   other   the convertible subordinate debentures are due in there are no intermediate put rights attached to the debentures 
we anticipate that mortgage bonds that come due in will be refinanced through the sale of new mortgage bonds or may be funded through the additional issuance of our equity capital 
if we were unable to refinance these bonds  or to raise capital to provide for these funds  the company would expect to utilize cash flows generated from operations and a portion of our line of credit borrowing capacity from our commercial banks 
we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our activities during the next months 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit or if we were unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending and any future acquisitions would be reduced  eliminated or delayed 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission a registration statement  which is effective for the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock  debt securities and warrants 
we may offer any of these securities for sale at any time and from time to time 
on december   we had working capital of approximately million with available cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million excluding restricted cash balances  as well as aggregate lines of credit totaling million consisting of three separate unsecured lines of credit from three commercial banks 
our total borrowing availability under lines of credit was approximately million on december  one line of credit expires in april  the other two expire in september for and  we had weighted average borrowing rates on our bank lines of credit of and  respectively 
in january  we expanded one of our lines of credit from one of our commercial banks by million 
this facility was utilized to issue a standby letter of credit in that amount as collateral for performance under a service contract to design and construct a reverse osmosis water treatment facility and associated wells 
this standby letter of credit is in force for the estimated two year construction period of the project 
upon acceptance of the completed project  expected in  the standby letter of credit and the related credit facility will be terminated 
in addition to our lines of credit  we have excess borrowing capacity under our first mortgage bond indentures of approximately million as of december  however  the additional borrowing available under our current commercial lines of credit is limited by financial covenants that restrict additional borrowing to an amount no greater than the remaining unused credit line amount 
we expect to maintain our lines of credit in the normal course of business 
each of the line of credit agreements contains certain financial covenants 
during  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under each of the line of credit agreements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  accounting for regulated business in accordance with sfas  stock based compensation  deferred costs  and unusual events 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available gaap alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues for contract operations are billed based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and income as work progresses on a project based on the expected total project costs and the expected total project revenues 
this method is based on an estimate of the revenue and income earned to date  less the revenue and income recognized in earlier periods 
if management determines the company will ultimately suffer a loss on a construction project  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period such a determination is made 
water utility revenues are recognized when water is delivered to customers 
at the end of an accounting period  estimated amounts for unbilled revenues are accrued for water usage since the previous billing period 
the company has adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on a prospective basis as of july  eitf modified the application of existing contract accounting literature followed by the company 
eitf governs how to identify whether goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
in most circumstances  eitf also limits the recognition of revenue in excess of amounts billed eg unbilled revenue to the amount that would be received if the client contract were terminated for any reason 
the company provides design  build  finance and operation services under time and material  unit price and fixed price contracts  which may extend up to or more years 
if a contract involves the provision of a single element  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable 
if services are provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  provided the elements qualify for separation under eitf the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts  except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non construction service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event 
if the amount of revenue allocated to a construction service is less than its relative fair value  costs to deliver such service  limited to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value  are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if total construction service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the construction service contained in a multiple element arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
revenues for submetering billing and collection services are recognized and billed at the end of the month in which services are performed 
revenues for installation of submetering equipment are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we assess intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method in accordance with statement no 
we have made acquisitions in the past that resulted in recording goodwill and intangible assets 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives  sfas no 
requires amortization over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  at december   other assets include approximately million of goodwill  which was no longer subject to amortization beginning in there were no impairment charges to goodwill as of december  and no events have occurred that indicated diminution in the value of recorded goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  we identified approximately million of intangible contract costs in connection with our acquisition of aqua services and approximately million of intangible contract costs in connection with our acquisition of optech 
we are amortizing the intangible contract costs over a period of four years  which is the average estimated life of the contracts 
accounting for regulated businesses our regulated businesses  which include our utilities in california  new mexico and texas  are required to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which specifies certain revenue  expense and balance sheet treatment as required by each state regulatory authority 
each state authority establishes rates which are intended to permit each utility to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return 
each utility may file and process general rate applications on a periodic basis 
since the established rates may be in effect for several years  our utilities attempt to anticipate cost increases and apply for rates sufficient to permit recovery of those cost increases when incurred  where permitted by state law 
one of our services group subsidiaries has contracted with our utilities in texas and new mexico to perform operating services  maintenance  and construction work  and to manage capital projects 
these contracts were established utilizing terms and conditions equivalent to prevailing industry rates for similar work performed by our services group for non affiliated customers 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our services group recognizes profit from work performed and does not eliminate the intercompany profit when the contract sales price is reasonable and it is probable that the costs and capital will be recoverable by the utility through the rate making process 
accordingly  the intercompany profit  for construction as well as o m services  and the related receivables and payables  on such work have not been eliminated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements 
however  all revenue in excess of profits has been eliminated in consolidation  consisting of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our california water utility has recorded a balancing account receivable in the amount of approximately million  representing the difference between actual water production costs incurred and cpuc adopted water production costs 
historically  the cpuc allowed such balancing accounts in the income statements of water utilities  with a corresponding liability or asset on the balance sheet 
however  the cpuc changed this policy by eliminating the use of balancing accounts as of november  in december  the cpuc issued a decision that we believe will allow our water utility in california to recover the million that was held in the balancing account as of november  beginning in december  our water utility has recognized all water costs as incurred 
currently the differences between actual and cpuc adopted water production costs are expensed as incurred 
these differences are tracked in a memorandum account and we will attempt to recover these expenses in future rate hearings 
stock based compensation in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 which requires valuation of stock options issued based upon an option pricing model and recognition of this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we elected to recognize stock based compensation using the retroactive restatement method 
under this change in accounting method  we restated our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for periods prior to to reflect stock based compensation expense under a fair value based accounting method for all options granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
deferred costs the company defers and subsequently amortizes certain direct contract acquisition costs related to activities to enable the provision of contracted services to the client 
deferred contract acquisition costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless revenue patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate 
deferred contract costs of million are shown net of accumulated amortization at december  amortization expense related to deferred contract costs was   and  for  and  respectively 
the recoverability of all long lived assets associated with a particular contract  including deferred contract costs  is analyzed on a periodic basis 
if long lived assets are determined to be impaired  an impairment is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
unusual events southwest water reports material events that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently  but not both  in other income expense rather than in operating income  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
reporting the results of operations 
apb no 
provides that unusual or infrequent events are separately disclosed and excluded from operating income  and that the nature and financial effects of each event or transaction should be disclosed on the face of the income statement 
included in other income on our consolidated statements of income is the effect of a one time  non taxable gain in of approximately million resulting from the termination of our defined benefit plan as more fully disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also included in other income for is a million agreement reached among parties responsible for the contamination and our california utility regarding water quality related expenses incurred in  and recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we adopted this statement in the third quarter of and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes accounting standards with respect for how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted this statement in the third quarter of  and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interest in variable interest entities created or obtained after january  for public companies  such as ours  the interpretation is applied to the enterprise no later than the end of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the application of this interpretation has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that an entity will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
fasb staff position no 
fin r  effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  a public entity need not apply the provisions of fin to an interest held in a variable interest entity or potential variable interest entity until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if both of the following apply the variable interest entity was created before february   and the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting interests in variable interest entities in accordance with fin  other than certain required disclosures 
we will adopt the provisions of fin for our financial statements for the periods ending after january  for any variable interest entities created before february  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have certain indebtedness that is subject to variable rate interest 
as a result  southwest water s interest expense is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates 
the interest expense paid on our line of credit borrowings and certain term loans is determined based upon a rate formula that fluctuates with short term libor rates and cannot exceed the banks prime rate minus one quarter percent 
we completed a million  year convertible subordinate debenture offering in july  which bears a fixed interest rate of per annum 
the proceeds were used to pay down certain variable rate indebtedness 
our long term debentures were sold with a fixed interest rate  and are not subject to market fluctuation of interest rates 
our debentures are convertible into southwest water common stock and at such time as our diluted earnings exceed per share  the debentures will be considered to be common stock equivalents and will be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share after adjusting net income for the after tax effect of the debenture interest expense
