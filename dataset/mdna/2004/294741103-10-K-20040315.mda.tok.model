table of contents office lease expiration schedule a december  the following schedule is based upon the contractual termination date of the leases  without regard to any lease termination and or renewal options 
some of our leases are subject to various forms of lease termination options exercisable by tenants 
depending on the form of the option  some of these options may or may not require the payment of a fee and a notice period as a condition to exercise 
although it is not possible to predict which tenants are likely to exercise these options  it has been our experience that markets in which the contractual rents are significantly higher than current market rents incur the greatest incidence of lease termination option exercises 
as a result of these lease termination options and other factors  such as tenant insolvencies  the actual termination dates of some portion of the leases may vary from the contractual expiration date set forth in the schedule
