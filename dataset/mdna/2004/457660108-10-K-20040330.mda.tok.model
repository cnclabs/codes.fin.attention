the cautionary statements made in this document should be read as applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this document 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below in risk factors  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
absent additional funding from final closing of the private placement we entered into in march or other private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  or other sources  as of march  we expect that our cash on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and current cash commitments to us will only be sufficient to fund our operations until approximately the middle of june if we are unable to complete the final closing related to the march private placement  there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for us to finance our operations on acceptable terms  if at all 
if such funds are not available  management will be required to cease all operations and liquidate our remaining assets  most of which is secured by a note to an officer who is also a board member 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to obtain funding and resultant ceasing of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or be able to maintain either significant revenues from product sales or profitable operations 
we are an ophthalmic product development company focused on ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology  as well as developing genetically based technology  for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma 
in addition  we have a retinal program that includes both a therapeutic agent and a retinal drug delivery technology 

table of contents in we faced significant challenges related to our lack of financial resources 
to continue our operations we took actions to reduce our cash usage including laying off approximately of our personnel  our senior management voluntarily reduced their salaries  we placed several development programs on hold including expansion of our isv technology  isv our retinal delivery device  and treatments for retinal diseases  slowed our clinical activities related to isv  and we instituted other cash saving actions including extending the payment of our liabilities 
with our limited resources we focused our research and development and commercial efforts on the following isv  a durasite formulation of a fourth generation fluoroquinolone  isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  an antibiotic not currently used in ophthalmology  and targeted activities to support the market introduction of our ocugene glaucoma genetic test based on our isv technology 
isv in february we filed an ind for our ophthalmic antibiotic product candidate isv  which was the first milestone under the august license agreement with bausch lomb and resulted in the receipt million from the sale of series a preferred stock 
in april we began a phase clinical trial of isv and in june the dosing for the study was completed 
in december we sold the isv product candidate to bausch lomb  which resulted in the receipt of million in cash  the return of the million of series a preferred stock  and the related dividends  to us for cancellation  and provides for royalties on future product sales  if any 
while we will be providing contract research services into the second quarter of  due to the sale bausch lomb is responsible for the further clinical development of the product and we will be able to focus our development efforts on our isv product candidate 
isv we have developed a topical formulation of the antibiotic  azithromycin  a broad spectrum of antibiotic activity and is widely used to treat respiratory and other infection in its oral and parenteral forms  to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and other infections of the outer eye 
the key advantages of isv include a significantly reduced dosing regimen doses vs 
doses for comparable products  the high and persistent levels of azithromycin achieved in the tissues of the eye and its wide spectrum of activity 
product safety and efficacy have been demonstrated  respectively  in phase and phase clinical trials 
as a result of our end of phase meeting with the fda early in  we intended to initiate two pivotal phase clinical trials 
due to our financial constraints the initiation of the trials was delayed and currently is planned for the second quarter of we anticipate conducting the trials in both the united states and internationally to permit aggressive enrollment of the subjects  including both children and adults  necessary to complete the studies 
we further anticipate that the primary endpoints of both trials will be microbial eradication and clinical cure 
our ability to execute on these clinical plans will be dependent upon the receipt of funds from the final closing related to our march private placement 
in we secured a new source for the active ingredient in isv and have a contract manufacturing site for production of clinical trial supplies and registration batches 
the supplies are being manufactured under the supervision of our personnel 
we are planning to begin manufacture the registration batches needed to support the filing of the nda at this contract facility in the second quarter of we anticipate that our contract manufacturing facility will be ready for inspection by the fda at the time of our nda submission 
ocugene 
our ocugene glaucoma genetic test is based on our glaucoma genetics program  which has been pursued in collaboration with academic researchers  is focused on discovering genes that are associated with glaucoma  and the mutations on these genes that cause and regulate the severity of the disease 
in june  a peer reviewed study was published in clinical genetics titled association of the myocilin mt 
promoter variant with the worsening of glaucomatous disease over time  
the results of this study indicate substantial evidence that the tigr myoc mt 
variant provides a strong marker for accelerated worsening of both optic disc and visual field measures of glaucoma progression above and beyond other baseline risk factors  stated one of the authors of the study  jon polansky  md  university of california  san francisco  who also serves on our scientific advisory board 

table of contents in  the information from this article and previous publications was used to target specific thought leaders and ophthalmic centers in an effort to support the focused introduction of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
expanded marketing efforts were curtailed as we contained our cash use 
since our inception through the end of  we had not received any revenues from the sale of our products  although we have received a small amount of royalties from the sale of our aquasite product by ciba vision and global damon 
in the fourth quarter of  we commercially launched our ocugene glaucoma genetic test and early in we began to receive a small amount of revenues from the sale of this test 
with the exception of  we have been unprofitable on an annual basis since our inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of our product candidates 
we have financed our research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placement of our equity securities  issuance of convertible debentures and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements and bridge loans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition 
we recognize up front fees from licensing and similar arrangements over the expected term of the related research and development services using the straight line method 
when changes in the expected term of ongoing services are identified  the amortization period for the remaining fees is appropriately modified 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the terms set forth in the related agreements 
revenue related to contract research services is recognized when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonable assured 
we directly reduce expenses for amounts reimbursed due to cost sharing agreements during the year ended december  and we recognize the received cost sharing payments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during the year ended  we recognized cost reimbursements as contract and other revenue in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursement for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to the sales of our product  the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  is recognized when all related services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenue for the sales of ocugene may be recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
the revenue in connection with the asset purchase agreement with baush lomb will be recognized over the contract period 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  administrative costs and materials for our research and development activities 
we also fund research at a variety of academic institutions based on agreements that are generally cancelable 
we recognize such costs as they are incurred 
cost of goods 
we recognize the cost of inventory shipped and other costs related to our ocugene glaucoma genetic test when they are incurred 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value a 
table of contents provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
at december   our inventories solely consisted of ocugene kits 
results of operations revenues 
we had total net revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from contract research activities  sales of ocugene and sales of aquasite by ciba vision and kukje pharma ind 
co  ltd  our aquasite manufacturing partner in korea 
the increase in revenue is due to contract research activities conducted for bausch lomb in under the isv asset purchase agreement 
we recognize revenue when all services have been performed and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenue for the sales of ocugene may be recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
cost of goods 
cost of goods of  and  for and respectively  reflect the cost of ocugene tests performed as well as the cost of sample collection kits distributed for use 
in a large number of ocugene test kits were distributed  as the product was made initially available to interested parties 
a significantly lower number of units were shipped in research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million from million in compared to this decrease reflects the personnel cost containment actions taken in the second quarter of and the reduction in support for external research which was begun in the first quarter of additionally  costs incurred in for the license of the optineuron gene from uchc and the related cost of new patent filings  were not incurred in as the majority of the initial filings were completed in r d expenses in decreased to million from million in this decrease mainly reflected a reduction in support for external research for our isv and isv programs as we focused our resources on the targeted launch of ocugene and on our antibiotic programs 
in  we received no r d cost reimbursements 
in  our r d cost reimbursements decreased to million from million in the decrease reflected the termination of the isv license by pharmacia in cost reimbursement in related to joint development programs to evaluate compounds for ophthalmic use 
our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product and the related pre clinical testing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands research clinical development total research and development due to our limited personnel and the number of projects that we are developing  our personnel are involved in a number of projects at the same time 
accordingly  the majority of our r d expenses are not linked to a specific project but are allocated across projects  based on personnel time expended on each project 
accordingly  the allocated costs may not reflect the actual costs of each project 
the decrease in research activities in compared to reflects the cost containment efforts initiated in the second quarter of in may  we instituted a one month furlough  which included of our research personnel 
in june  approximately of the furloughed research personnel were laid off 
in we also continued to reduce our financial support of the research related to our genetics programs by not renewing certain research contracts pending the receipt of additional funding 
in a further effort to reduce expenses  we have reviewed  and will continue to review  our patent filings and will 
table of contents discontinue maintenance of patents and patent applications related to programs that we have determined not to pursue 
the decrease in research activities in compared to mainly represents the conversion of a portion of the isv research into the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  which is in the initial marketing launch phase 
research is being conducted on other genes and genetic markers but at a lower rate as our limited resources are used to support the commercialized technology 
as much of this research is conducted at external academic centers  we were able to scale back this research without incurring termination costs 
the decrease in clinical development expenses from million in to million in reflects the cost containment efforts initiated across the company in the second quarter of in may  we instituted a one month furlough  which included of our clinical development personnel 
in june  approximately of the furloughed clinical development personnel were laid off 
additionally  clinical development costs related to the ocugene glaucoma genetic test were reduced as the studies were completed in and no new studies were begun in clinical development expenses remained consistent between and  as the clinical trial activity was comparable between the two years 
we shifted the resources used to file the ind for isv in to similar activities on the isv program in most of our projects are in the early stages of the product development cycle and may not result in commercial products 
projects in development may not proceed into clinical trials due to a number of reasons even though the project looks promising early in the process 
once a project reaches clinical trials it may be found to be ineffective or there may be harmful side effects 
additionally  during the development cycle  other companies may develop new treatments that decrease the market potential for our project and we may decide not to proceed 
other factors including the cost of manufacturing at a commercial scale and the availability of quality manufacturing capabilities could negatively impact our ability to bring the project to the market 
also  our business strategy is to license projects to third parties to complete the development cycle and to market and sell the product 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements for any product candidate  our ability to commercialize the product may be slowed or we may decide not to proceed with that candidate 
these collaborative arrangements may either speed the development or they may extend the anticipated time to market 
because of these factors  as well as others  we cannot be certain if  or when  our projects in development will complete the development cycle and be commercialized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in this reflects the approximately decrease in selling expenses related to the initial market introduction of ocugene  such as advertising and our limited initial contract sales force 
the remaining decrease includes a decrease in personnel related costs due to the impact of the employee furloughs  lay offs and voluntary salary reductions 
while our legal costs related to our fund raising efforts and the cost of our insurance coverage  including directors and officers insurance increased approximately in compared to  these costs were more than offset by the other expense containment measures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in to million from million in the increase in reflects the additional costs incurred to support the ongoing launch of the ocugene glaucoma genetic test 
these costs included the addition of a vp of commercial development  expanded promotional advertising and outreach activities into ophthalmic and optometric practices 
gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets reflects the sale of the isv product candidate to bausch lomb in december we received million in cash and bausch lomb surrendered the million of series a preferred stock  plus accumulated dividends  we had issued to them under the august license and preferred stock purchase agreements 
the total gain will be recognized over the five month period that we have an obligation to provide contract research support for isv  which began in december interest  other income and expenses 
net interest  other income and expense was an expense of  in compared to income of  in this change principally reflects the  of interest expense related to the debt 
table of contents discount of the convertible debentures  interest expense related to the short term notes payable and to lower average cash balances 
as of december   of the debt discount remained and will be amortized over the life of the notes 
net interest  other income and expense was income of  in compared to income of  in this decrease is due principally to lower average cash balances and decreased interest rates 
any interest earned or paid in the future will be dependent on our ability to raise additional funding and prevailing interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
it is our policy to invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
in march  we received approximately million  net of placement fees  from the initial closing of a total private placement that will yield aggregate gross proceeds of million 
our ability to receive the remainder of the funds at the final closing will be subject to receipt of stockholder approval of the final closing of the placement and of the increase in our authorized shares necessary to issue both the common stock to be issued in the final closing of the placement and the common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued as part of the final closing of the placement  and satisfaction of other standard conditions contained in the subscription agreements 
we will be seeking the necessary stockholder approval at our annual meeting of stockholders  which is scheduled to take place on june  our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
absent additional funding from the final closing related to the march private placement  other private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  asset sales  or other sources  we expect that our cash on hand  anticipated cash flow from operations and current cash commitments to us will only be adequate to fund our operations until approximately the middle of june also  pursuant to the terms of the private placement we are generally prohibited from raising additional financing through the issuance of securities during the period from the initial closing through the earlier to occur of the final closing and june  subject to extension at our sole discretion  which could significantly harm our ability to continue operations of the final closing does not occur 
if we are unable to complete the final closing of the march private placement or secure sufficient additional funding prior to the middle of june  we will need to cease operations and liquidate our assets  most of which is secured by a note to an officer who is also a board member 
our financial statements were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
even if we are able to complete the final closing of the march private placement  in order to continue long term operations beyond approximately the third quarter of  we will require and are seeking additional funding through collaborative or other partnering arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  asset sales and from other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain interim or longer term financing or that such funding  if obtained  will be sufficient to continue our operations as currently conducted or in a manner necessary for the long term success of our company 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  such debt will be secured by a security interest or pledge of all of our assets  will require us to make principal and interest payments  would likely include the issuance of warrants and may subject us to restrictive covenants 
in addition  our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities 
for the years ended december   and  cash used for operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from used in investing activities were   and  primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of assets and cash outlays for additions to laboratory and other equipment made during  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we received million in the first quarter of from the issuance of  shares of our series a preferred stock to bausch lomb under the isv 
table of contents license agreement 
we issued million of short term notes payable in to directors  members of senior management and other stockholders 
these notes bear interest at rates from to and are due from january  through march  we received  net of debt issuance costs of approximately  from the issuance of convertible debentures in these debentures bear interest at a rate of and are due on september  in we received  from the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options by employees compared to  in and  in during  we also received  in connection with private placements of our common stock 
we received payments on a note to a stockholder of  and  in and  respectively 
we also made  of payments on capital leases for certain laboratory equipment in compared to  in and  in assuming we are able to obtain additional financing and continue our operations  our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our clinical testing  research and development programs and preclinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to successfully commercialize ocugene and any other products that we may launch in the future  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
we anticipate no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our environmental compliance record to date  and our belief that we are current in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years more than years operating lease obligations licensing agreement obligations total commitments we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents which may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under such agreements are as noted for through and are approximately  per year until the first commercial sale  increase to  per year in the first three years of sales  and then increase to  per year until the expiration of the related patents 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after december  we will adopt fin effective january  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 

table of contents in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in certain circumstances 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
although some of the provisions of this statement are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements  the remainder is consistent with fasb s intention to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own shares 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements related to sfas for the year ended december  item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   we had million invested in money market mutual funds 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material
