item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december    and the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the company and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and selected statistical information included in this report 
application of critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company considers the following accounting policies and related estimates to be the most critical in their potential effect on its financial position or results of operations allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge against current earnings to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
there are three components of the allowance for loan losses specific reserves for loans considered to be impaired or for other loans for which management considers a specific reserve to be necessary  allocated reserves based upon management s formula based process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and a non specific environmentally driven allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of other qualitative factors 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly reviewed by the company for adequacy using a consistent  systematic methodology which assesses such factors as changes in the mix and volume of the loan portfolio  trends in portfolio credit quality  including delinquency and charge off rates  and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower s ability to repay 
adverse changes in management s assessment of these factors could lead to additional provisions for loan losses 
the company s methodology with respect to the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is more fully discussed on pages of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
goodwill impairment 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  effective january  the statement addresses the method of identifying and measuring goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eliminates further amortization of goodwill  and requires periodic impairment evaluations of goodwill 
impairment evaluations are required to be performed annually and may be required more frequently if certain conditions indicating potential impairment exist 
in the event that the company determined that its goodwill was impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on its results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on its financial position 
mortgage servicing rights msrs 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through the sale of financial assets on a servicing retained basis 
capitalized servicing rights are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost 
impairment is determined by stratifying servicing rights by predominant characteristics  such as interest rates and original loan terms 
fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics  when available  or based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
when the book value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value  an impairment reserve is recognized so that each individual stratum is carried at the lower of its amortized book value or fair value 
in periods of falling market interest rates  accelerated loan prepayment speeds can adversely impact the fair value of these mortgage servicing rights relative to their book value 
in the event that the fair value of these assets were to increase in the future  the company can recognize the increased fair value to the extent of the impairment allowance but cannot recognize an asset in excess of its amortized book value 
future changes in management s assessment of the impairment of these servicing assets  as a result of changes in observable market data relating to market interest rates  loan prepayment speeds  and other factors  could impact the company s financial condition and results of operations either positively or adversely 
interest income recognition 
interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon interest rates applied to unpaid principal 
interest is not accrued on loans days or more past due unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection or on other loans when management believes collection is doubtful 
all loans considered impaired are nonaccruing 
interest on nonaccruing loans is recognized as payments are received when the ultimate collectibility of interest is no longer considered doubtful 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued is reversed against current period interest income  therefore an increase in loans on nonaccrual status could have an adverse impact on interest income recognized in future periods 
income taxes 
the company estimates its income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which it operates to determine an appropriate expense against current earnings 
this involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as timing of the deduction of expenses  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgment is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there were no valuation allowances set aside against any deferred tax assets 
restructuring charges 
the company recognizes restructuring charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges  which contain specific guidance regarding the types of  and circumstances under which  certain expenses can be accrued 
in general  the statements require that the company have a detailed plan in place  which has been communicated to substantially all the employees affected in the staff reduction  branch closures sales  or computer conversions 
significant management judgment is required in estimating the amount of expense that is appropriate to recognize in relation to these plans 
executive overview net income for was million  an increase of million from and million from diluted earnings per share for were compared to for and for return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe are two industry measures on which the financial performance of a banking institution is generally measured 
during  the company s roa was compared to in and in during  the company s roe was compared to and in and  respectively 
the decreases in roe and roa in and were primarily attributable to the granite bank and ocean national bank acquisitions  and the intangibles recognized and equity issued in conjunction with those transactions 
chittenden s net interest income increased million from s level of million to million in the increase was due to higher average earning assets  which offset a declining net interest margin 
the growth in earning assets was primarily attributable to the acquisition of gb and continued strong deposit growth 
the provision for loan losses was approximately million lower in due to continued improvement in the company s asset quality and stronger economic conditions throughout the company s primary market areas 
noninterest income increased million in due to higher gains on sales of mortgage loans  improved results on mortgage servicing and stronger fee income 
gains on sales of mortgage loans were million higher in due to significantly higher volumes of loans sold as a result of a precipitous decline in long term interest rates in the first six months of mortgage servicing income was approximately million higher in due to lower required impairment reserves on the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
the reduction in the required reserves resulted from declines in market based forward prepayment rates used to estimate the fair value of these assets 
gains on sale of securities increased in by million due primarily to the early redemption of long term borrowings  which was funded by the sale of securities and portfolio reconfigurations to reduce extension risk 
penalties paid on the early prepayment of borrowings were million and the weighted average cost of funds was 
noninterest income  excluding securities gains  prepayment penalties  mortgage servicing and gains on sales of loans increased million from the company continued to realize solid increases in its fee income businesses due to its broader footprint and an expanded customer base 
the gb acquisition accounted for million of the increase in service charges and million of the increase in net insurance commissions 
noninterest expenses were up million from primarily due to the acquisition of gb  one time expenses related to the conversion of the company s information technology it platform as well as other restructuring activities and higher incentive expenses driven by a significant increase in the origination of mortgage loans 
in early  the company preformed an extensive review of its it systems and software  including its core banking system 
the review was driven by the company s significant growth over the past seven years and the continued expansion of its product lines 
the company performed an extensive analysis of it vendors to determine which could provide the best service and support to the company and its customers 
after completing this thorough analysis  jack henry associates  inc  was selected to be the company s future it provider for a period of five years 
during  the company recognized expenses of million relating to the it conversion  including million in payments to terminate the company s existing it contract  and million in impairment of computer equipment which will not be portable to the new operating platform 
the remaining costs related to travel  training  overtime and external project management 
in the latter half of  the company formulated and began executing certain restructuring plans related to consolidation or closure of certain branch locations  the majority of which related to the anticipated merger of granite bank into ocean national bank in the second quarter of  the closure of certain offsite atm locations  primarily in new hampshire and southern maine  and severance related to the branch consolidations and closures  and the centralization of back office functions planned as part of the it platform conversion in may chittenden recognized a restructuring charge relating to these three categories of million in the fourth quarter of overall  net income was million in compared to million in net interest income increased million primarily as a result of the acquisitions of onb and mbt and strong growth in deposits 
the provision for loan losses was  higher in due to declining economic conditions and increased net charge offs 
noninterest income increased million in primarily due to increases in service charges on deposits  insurance commissions  and gains on sales of securities  which was substantially offset by lower mortgage servicing income 
the reduction in mortgage servicing income was due to a significant decline in longterm interest rates in the fourth quarter of  which led to the recognition of an million impairment charge against the carrying value of the company s msr portfolio 
the increase of million in service charges on deposits was attributed to the onb acquisition as well as strong deposit flows throughout and higher cash management fees 
noninterest expenses were up million from primarily due to the acquisitions of onb and mbt and higher incentive expenses  which was partially offset by a reduction in amortization of intangibles 
financial condition loans chittenden s loan portfolio at december  totaled billion compared to billion at year end the classification of the company s loan portfolio is based on underlying collateral utilizing bank regulatory definitions 
acquired in the gb transaction were loans totaling million  consisting primarily of commercial and residential loans 
commercial real estate loans  representing of chittenden s year end portfolio  increased million or to billion at year end the granite acquisition accounted for approximately million in commercial real estate loans while continued strong originations throughout the company s existing banking franchises accounted for the remainder of the growth 
at december   commercial loans secured by non real estate business assets totaled million an increase of from the increase of million was primarily attributable to continued strong organic growth throughout the company s banking operations and the acquisition of gb  which contributed million at the time of acquisition 
included in the commercial portfolio are business credit cards  which amounted to million in compared to million in construction loans totaled million at december   up million from the year before 
the gb acquisition contributed approximately million of the increase 
the primary emphasis in the construction portfolio relates to the financing of projects for the company s commercial customers  as well as individual consumer loans 
the construction loan portfolio is comprised of approximately in loans to commercial customers for owner occupied properties  in individual consumer construction loans  to residential developers  and for commercial customers for investor properties 
residential real estate loans totaled billion in  an increase of million from the total included million from the gb acquisition 
total paydowns of the residential real estate portfolio were million in compared with million in new originations added to the portfolio did not keep pace with paydowns because the majority of loans originated in were fixed rate loans sold on the secondary market 
included in the real estate portfolio are outstanding balances under home equity credit lines  totaling million at december  compared to million the previous year 
the unused portion of these lines totaled million at december  compared to million at year end consumer loans increased million in  or from the prior year end 
indirect installment lending through auto dealers increased million from year end to million at the end of direct installment balances at december  stood at million of which approximately million related to the gb acquisition compared with million at the end of lease financing receivables outstanding at december  were million  down from million a year earlier 
the residual value of leased vehicles represented million and million  respectively of the balances at those dates 
the large decline in lease financing receivables was a result of the company s late decision to exit this market and the continuing maturity of the remaining portfolio 
the contractual maturities of the remaining lease portfolio at december  are million in  million in  and  in the company s lending activities are conducted in market areas focused in vermont  western and central massachusetts  southern maine  and new hampshire  with additional activity related to nearby trading areas in new york and connecticut 
in addition to the geographic portfolio diversification described above  the loans are widely diversified by borrowers and industry groups 
the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio for the five years ended december  december  in thousands commercial municipal real estate residential family multi family home equity commercial construction consumer lease financing total gross loans allowance for loan losses net loans loans held for sale mortgage banking operations residential mortgages originated during totaled billion  compared to million during this increase was due to continued high volumes of fixed rate residential loans caused by increasingly lower market rates  through mid after hitting their recent all time lows in june  rates stabilized in the second half of the year but volumes remained heavy into the fourth quarter as the pipeline of loan applications was processed and closed 
an uptick in market rates late in october slowed the flow of applications so that loans held for sale at year end was considerably lower than a year ago as well as from the interim quarter ends 
the company underwrites its residential mortgages to secondary market standards and continues to follow its policy of selling substantially all of its fixed rate residential mortgage production on a servicing retained non recourse basis 
secondary market sales of mortgage loans totaled billion in  compared to million in the portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for investors totaled billion at december  compared to billion at year end serviced loans obtained in the gb acquisition were million 
these assets are owned by investors other than chittenden and therefore are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company has recorded an originated mortgage servicing rights asset for all mortgages sold on a servicing retained basis 
as noted under application of critical accounting policies  the company evaluates the msr asset for impairment on a quarterly basis 
at december  the msrs amortized cost of million was reduced by an impairment reserve of million  so that the carrying value of each stratum of the msr asset did not exceed its fair value at that date 
nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
management classifies loans as nonaccrual when they become days past due as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
in addition  loans that have not met this delinquency test may be placed on nonaccrual at management s discretion 
to the extent that certain loans classified as nonaccrual have an associated governmental agency guarantee  a separate assessment of the classification of the guaranteed portion is made 
generally  as long as interest and principal are less than days past due  the guaranteed amounts are collectible from the guarantor and therefore are not classified as nonaccrual 
in these situations  only the non guaranteed portion of the loan would be classified as nonaccrual 
in the event that a guaranteed loan was to exceed days past due  no further interest would be accrued on the guaranteed portion  as it would not be reimbursed by the guarantor 
consumer and residential loans are included when management considers it to be appropriate  based upon evidence of collectibility  the value of any underlying collateral and other general criteria 
generally  a loan remains on nonaccrual status until the factors  which indicated doubtful collectibility no longer  exist or the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is classified as a restructured loan when its interest rate is reduced and or other terms are modified because of the inability of the borrower to service debt at current market rates and terms 
other real estate owned oreo is real estate that has been formally acquired through foreclosure and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value

of the loans  only two loans had balances over million the two loans totaled million 
nonaccrual loans with payments less than days past due represent of total loans on nonaccrual at december  allowance for loan losses adequacy of the allowance is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  which analyzes the risk of the loan portfolio 
in addition to evaluating the collectibility of specific loans when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management also takes into consideration other factors such as changes in the mix and size of the loan portfolio  historic loss experience  the amount of delinquencies and loans adversely classified  and economic trends 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is assessed by an allocation process whereby specific loss allocations are made against certain adversely classified loans  and general loss allocations are made against segments of the loan portfolio which have similar attributes 
the company s historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers  were considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against current earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
while management uses available information to assess possible losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in non performing loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons 
any future additions to the allowance would be recognized in the period in which they were determined to be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require the company to record additions to the allowance based on judgements different from those of management 
credit quality of the commercial portfolios is quantified by a corporate credit rating system designed to parallel regulatory criteria and categories of loan risk 
individual loan officers monitor their loans to ensure appropriate rating assignments are made on a timely basis 
risk ratings and quality of both commercial and consumer credit portfolios are also assessed on a regular basis by an independent credit review department 
credit review personnel conduct ongoing portfolio trend analyses and individual credit reviews to evaluate loan risk and compliance with corporate lending policies 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
consumer and residential real estate loan quality is evaluated on the basis of delinquency data and other credit data available due to the large number of such loans and the relatively small size of individual credits 
allocations for these loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of inherent losses 
in each category  inherent losses are estimated based upon management s assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions and past experience 
in addition  certain loans in these categories may be individually risk rated if considered necessary by management 
the other method used to allocate the allowance for loan losses entails the assignment of reserve amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the company will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method  loans are selected for evaluation based on internal risk ratings or non accrual status 
a specific reserve amount is allocated to an individual loan when that loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is estimable on the basis of its collateral value  the present value of anticipated future cash flows  or its net realizable value 
at december   impaired loans with specific reserves totaled  all of these loans were on nonaccrual status and the amount of such reserves were  results and recommendations from these processes provide senior management and the board of directors with independent information on loan portfolio condition 
the board of directors monitors asset quality throughout the year

the provision was flat on a year over year basis from to in  the provision was  lower than in the previous year  primarily due to lower levels of charge offs that year compared to the allowance as a percentage of loans climbed to  as a result of the mbt acquisition and lower commercial charge offs 
in  the provision was increased by approximately  primarily due to higher levels of commercial charge offs and the onb acquisition  which brought a concentration of commercial real estate loans that was higher than the company had carried previously 
finally in  the provision was reduced by million  primarily due to improved credit quality evidenced by much lower net charge offs  which declined million 
the allowance as a percentage of loans declined from to as a result of the reduced provision and because of the low levels of nonperforming assets npas

the allowance for loan losses is allocated to various loan categories as part of the company s process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
allocated reserves increased by approximately million to million at december  changes in the distribution of the allocated allowance principally occurred due to the acquisition of gb

unfunded commitments and contingencies other during  the allowance for loan loss allocated to commercial loans increased by million  the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans increased by million  and the amount allocated to construction loans increased million 
these increases were primarily attributed to the gb acquisition and to loan growth in these categories 
during  the amount allocated to the consumer and leasing portfolios declined by approximately  while the overall percentage of portfolio loans in these categories declined from to 
amounts allocated to unfunded include reserves for certain contingencies such as letters of credit and merchant processing 
the other category is the allowance considered necessary by management based on its assessment of historical loss experience  industry trends  and the impact of the local and regional economy on the company s borrowers that have not been captured in the specific risk classifications 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and the effects of changing environmental conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in the data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the company s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the investment portfolio is used to meet liquidity demands  mitigate interest rate sensitivity  invest excess liquidity  and generate interest income 
at december   the company held investments available for sale totaling billion  an increase of from the increase from to is primarily attributable to the gb acquisition as well as continued deposit growth throughout the company 
at december   net unrealized gains were million compared with net unrealized gains of million at december  the decline is primarily due to higher interest rates at year end and sales of securities during in  the financial markets experienced significant interest rate volatility with the two  five and ten year treasuries hitting lows of  and and highs of  and respectively 
this volatility primarily impacted mortgage backed securities and callable agencies both in terms of accelerated paydowns as well as duration

these debentures are the sole asset of the trust subsidiary 
the tps pay interest quarterly  are mandatorily redeemable on july  and may be redeemed by the trust at par any time on or after july  the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the securities issued by the chittenden capital trust i 
concurrent with the issuance of these securities  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with two counterparties  in which the company will receive fixed on the notional amount of million  while paying the counterparties a variable rate based on the three month libor london interbank offered rate  plus approximately basis points 
as part of the company s first quarter adoption of fin revised december  consolidations of variable interest entities  the company will no longer consolidate the trust subsidiary in its financial statements 
however  the million of junior subordinate debentures issued by the company to the trust will continue to be classified as borrowings on the company s balance sheet  and the related interest expense will continue to be so classified in the future 
certain immaterial balances between the company and the trust  which are currently eliminated in consolidation  may be recognized in the company s financial statements 
however  management does not expect that the deconsolidation of the trust subsidiary will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in capital resources the company s capital is the foundation for developing programs for growth and new activities 
total capital at december  was million an increase of million from december  the current level reflects the issuance of million in common stock on february  as consideration in the granite bank transaction 
net income of million increased the company s capital position in  while dividend payments of million reduced it 
the increase in capital was also affected by decreases in accumulated other comprehensive income which were primarily driven by lower net unrealized gains on securities available for sale of million 
this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the net accrued minimum pension liability 
the company periodically repurchased its own stock under a share repurchase program originally authorized by the board of directors on january   which expired on december  the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of million under this program 
net income of million increased the capital position in  while dividend payments of million and share repurchases of million  shares reduced it 
the increase in capital was also affected by increases in accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
the frb  fdic and occ have defined leverage capital requirements  which measure tier i capital as defined below against average total assets without regard to risk weighting 
additionally  the frb and the fdic have a risk based capital standard 
under this measure of capital  banks are required to hold more capital against certain assets perceived as higher risk  such as commercial loans  than against other assets perceived as lower risk  such as residential mortgage loans and us treasury securities 
further  off balance sheet items such as unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit  are included for the purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
commercial banking organizations are required to have total capital equal to of risk weighted assets  and tier capital consisting of common stock and certain types of preferred stock  including the tps equal to at least of risk weighted assets 
tier capital  included in total capital  includes the allowance for possible loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets 
fdic regulations pertaining to capital adequacy  which apply to the banks  require a minimum leverage capital ratio for those institutions with the most favorable composite regulatory examination rating 
in addition  a tier risk based capital ratio  and an total risk based capital ratio are required for a bank to be considered adequately capitalized 
leverage  tier risk based  and total risk based capital ratios exceeding   and  respectively  qualify a bank for the well capitalized designation 
the following table presents the regulatory capital ratios for each subsidiary bank and the company at december  ctc bwm fbt mbt onb gb company leverage tier risk based total risk based these ratios placed the banks in the fdic s highest capital category of well capitalized 
capital ratios in excess of minimum requirements indicate capacity to take advantage of profitable and credit worthy opportunities as well as the potential to respond to unforeseen adverse conditions 
as noted previously  the trust subsidiary that issued the company s trust preferred securities will no longer be consolidated into the company s financial statements upon adoption of fin r in the first quarter of however  the company will continue to reflect the amounts payable to the trust s preferred shareholders as debt in its financial statements 
at some future point  this accounting change may result in the exclusion of the trust preferred securities from tier capital  however  the frb has indicated that it will continue to qualify as such until further notice and that it may be grandfathered for some period of time in the event that it were to conclude that it should no longer qualify as tier capital 
the company has evaluated the potential impact of such a change on its tier capital ratio and has concluded that it would remain well capitalized in the event the frb were to change the regulatory capital treatment of these securities to tier ii 
the regulatory treatment of the tps will not impact in the company s total capital ratio

the components of capital under gaap that are not considered capital for regulatory purposes include goodwill  unrealized gains losses on investments and directors deferred compensation to be settled in stock 
liquidity the company s liquidity and rate sensitivity are monitored by the asset and liability committee  based upon policies approved by the board of directors 
the measure of an institution s liquidity is its ability to meet its cash commitments at all times with available cash or by conversion of other assets to cash at a reasonable price 
the company s affiliate banks generate significant amounts of low cost funds through their deposit gathering operations 
for the year ended december   the company s ratio of average loans to average deposits was approximately 
at december   the company maintained cash balances and short term investments of approximately million  compared with million at december  borrowings at december  were million compared to million on december  in addition  the company has available borrowing capacity under certain programs including the fhlb  us treasury  repurchase agreements lines  and advised fed funds lines totaling more than million

no pension contributions are reflected beyond months because these depend on a variety of factors that cannot be easily predicted 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business  to meet the financing needs of their customers and to reduce their own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  the banks are parties to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  held for purposes other than trading 
the financial instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument  for loan commitments and standby letters of credit  is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments  assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that collateral or other security is of no value 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they do for on balance sheet loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the banks upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
commitments to originate loans  unused lines of credit  and unadvanced portions of construction loans are agreements to lend to a customer provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the amounts presented below do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance by a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are issued primarily to support public and private borrowing arrangements  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent off balance sheet risk at december  and are as follows in thousands loans and other commitments commitments to originate loans unused home equity lines of credit unused portions of credit card lines unadvanced portions of construction loans equity investment commitments to limited partnerships standby letters of credit notional amount of standby letters of credit fully collateralized by cash notional amount of other standby letters of credit liability associated with letters of credit recorded on balance sheet results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net interest income net interest income is the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  foreign exchanges  commodity prices  equity prices  and other market driven rates or prices 
since the company has no trading operations  risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices are not significant 
interest rate risk  including mortgage prepayment risk  is the single most significant non credit risk to which the company is exposed 
to measure the sensitivity of its income to changes in interest rates  the company uses a variety of methods  including simulation  and gap analyses 
interest rate risk is the sensitivity of income to variations in interest rates over both short term and long term horizons 
the primary goal of interest rate management is to control this risk within limits approved by the board of directors  which reflect the company s tolerance for interest rate risk 
the company attempts to control interest rate risk by identifying exposures  quantifying them and taking appropriate actions 
the company uses simulation analyses to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a relatively short ie  within one year time horizon 
simulation analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer and competitor behavior in the specified interest rate scenario 
these assumptions are the basis for projecting future interest income and expense from the company s assets and liabilities under various scenarios 
simulation analysis may have certain limitations caused by market conditions varying from those assumed in a model 
actual results can often differ due to the effects of prepayments and refinancings of loans and investments  as well as the repricing or runoff of deposits  which may be different from that which has been assumed 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift immediately  up or down basis points  estimated net interest income for the next twelve months should neither improve or be impacted by greater than 
an additional analysis is performed to review results if interest rates were to shift quarterly  ramped up or down and basis points over a twelve month period 
the results of these simulations are shown below interest rate sensitivity analysis calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income december  changes in interest rates bps bps bps bps policy limit the basis point shock down scenario has a very remote probability of occurring  therefore the results are only for informational purposes 
as noted above  one of the tools used to measure rate sensitivity is the funds gap 
the funds gap is defined as the amount by which a bank s rate sensitive assets exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
a positive gap exists when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities 
this indicates that a greater volume of assets than liabilities will reprice during a given period 
this mismatch will improve earnings in a rising rate environment and inhibit earnings when rates decline 
conversely  when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the gap is referred to as negative and indicates that a greater volume of liabilities than assets will reprice during the period 
in this case  a rising rate environment will inhibit earnings and declining rates will improve earnings 
notwithstanding this general description of the effect on income of the gap position  it may not be an accurate predictor of changes in net interest income 
the company s limits on interest rate risk specify that the cumulative one year gap should be less than of total assets 
as of december   the estimated exposure was and the company was asset sensitive 
the following table shows the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  that reprice during the periods indicated repricing date one day to six months over six months to one year over one year to five years over five years total in thousands interest earning assets loans investment securities interest bearing cash equivalents total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap at december  cumulative gap at december  total includes loans held for sale and total loans
