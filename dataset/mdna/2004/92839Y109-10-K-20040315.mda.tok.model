item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since completing an initial public offering of our common stock in december our business has continued to grow 
as of december   we were operating hospice programs serving a total of  patients in states 
net patient revenue increased from million in to in while net income before accrued preferred stock dividends increased from million in to million in substantially all of our growth in recent years has been organic 
our business has benefited from regular increases in medicare hospice reimbursement rates  including the two most recent increases effective october  and october   each being over the base rates then in effect 
we recorded a tax provision of million in as compared to a tax provision of million in  reflecting the full utilization of the balance of our tax loss carryforwards in and the growth in net income 
we expect that our effective tax rate  which was in  will increase significantly in net patient revenue net patient revenue is the amount we believe we are entitled to collect for our services  adjusted as described below 
the amount we believe we are entitled to collect for our services varies depending on the level of care provided  the payor and the geographic area where the services are rendered 
net patient revenue includes adjustments for estimated payment denials excluding payment denials related to medicare reimbursements for nursing home room and board charges and contractual adjustments  patients who do not have insurance coverage and who are deemed financially in need of charity care  amounts we estimate we could be required to repay to medicare  such as amounts that we would be required to repay if any of our programs exceed the annual per beneficiary cap  as described below under critical accounting policies and significant estimates potential adjustments to net patient revenue for exceeding the medicare per beneficiary cap  and subsequent changes to initial level of care determinations 
we adjust our estimates from time to time based on our billing and collection experience 
only after a patient s hospice eligibility has been determined  a payment source has been identified and services have been provided do we recognize net patient revenue for services that we provide to that patient 
we derive net patient revenue from billings to medicare  medicaid  private insurers  managed care providers  patients and others 
we operate under arrangements with those payors pursuant to which they reimburse us for services we provide to hospice eligible patients they cover  subject only to our submission of adequate and timely claim documentation 
our patient intake process screens patients for hospice eligibility and identifies whether their care will be covered by medicare  medicaid  private insurance  managed care or self pay 
medicare reimbursements account for the majority of our net patient revenue 
our net patient revenue is determined primarily by the number of billable patient days  the level of care provided and reimbursement rates 
the number of billable patient days is a function of the number of patients admitted to our programs and the number of days that those patients remain in our care length of stay 
our average length of stay was approximately days in  which we believe exceeds the industry average 
we attribute our ability to exceed the industry average in terms of length of stay to several factors 
first  we have a relatively high percentage of non cancer patients  who have a higher average length of stay than cancer patients 
second  we believe that our open access philosophy and our efforts to educate referral sources about hospice care encourages earlier transfers of patients to hospice care 
finally  a significant amount of our growth in recent periods has been in rural markets where access to intensive care hospitals or other alternative sites for hospice eligible patients is more difficult 
the table below sets forth the percentage of our net patient revenue in and derived from medicare  medicaid  private insurers and managed care payors 
year ended december  medicare medicaid private insurers and managed care medicare  medicaid and most private insurers and managed care providers pay for hospice care at a daily or hourly rate that varies depending on the level of care provided 
for a discussion of those levels of care established by medicare and the current applicable medicare reimbursement rates  see business overview of the hospice care industry funding hospice care medicare  medicaid and other sources and business government regulation overview of government payments medicare 
the table below sets forth the percentage of our net patient revenue generated under each of the four medicare levels of care for the periods indicated year ended december  level of care routine home care general inpatient care continuous home care respite inpatient care typically  each october  medicare adjusts its base hospice care reimbursement rates for the following year based on inflation and other economic factors 
effective april   the medicare base rates were increased over the base rates then in effect 
such rates were further increased by effective october   effective october   and effective october  these increases have favorably impacted our net patient revenue 
medicare s base rates are subject to regional adjustments based on local wage levels 
these regional adjustments are not necessarily proportional to adjustments in the base rates 
medicaid reimbursement rates and hospice care coverage rates for private insurers and managed care plans tend to approximate medicare rates 
because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice care services based on the level of care provided to our hospice patients  we are at risk for the cost of services provided to our hospice patients 
we cannot assure that medicare and medicaid will continue to pay for hospice care in the same manner or in the same amount that they currently do 
reductions in amounts paid by government programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments  which would likely result in similar changes by private third party payors  could adversely affect our net patient revenue and profitability 
expenses we recognize expenses as incurred 
our primary expenses include those we classify as either patient care expenses or general and administrative expenses 
patient care expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  payroll taxes and travel costs associated with our hospice care providers 
patient care expenses also include the cost of pharmaceuticals  durable medical equipment  medical supplies  inpatient arrangements  nursing home costs  net  and purchased services such as ambulance  infusion and radiology 
we incur inpatient facility costs primarily through per diem lease arrangements with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities where we provide our services 
we also operate a bed  stand alone inpatient hospice facility and an bed skilled nursing facility 
patient length of stay impacts our patient care expenses as a percentage of net patient revenue 
patient care expenses are generally higher during the initial and latter days of care 
in the initial days of care  expenses tend to be higher because of the initial purchases of pharmaceuticals  medical equipment and supplies and the administrative costs of determining the patient s hospice eligibility  registering the patient and organizing the plan of care 
in the latter days of care  expenses tend to be higher because patients generally require more services  such as pharmaceuticals and nursing care  due to their deteriorating medical condition 
accordingly  if lengths of stay decline  those higher costs are spread over fewer days of care  which increases patient care expenses as a percentage of net patient revenue and negatively impacts profitability 
patient care expenses are also impacted by the geographic concentration of patients 
labor expenses  which represent the single largest category of patient care expenses  tend to be less if patients are geographically concentrated and hospice care providers are required to spend less time traveling and can care for more patients 
for our patients who receive nursing home care under state medicaid programs in states other than arizona  oklahoma  pennsylvania and south carolina  the applicable medicaid program pays us an amount equal to no more than of the medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board services furnished to the patient by the nursing home in addition to the medicare or medicaid routine home care per diem payment 
we pay the nursing home for these room and board services at a rate between and of the full medicaid per diem nursing home rate  depending on the terms of the contract between us and the nursing home 
we include the difference between the amount we pay the nursing home and the amount we receive from medicaid net of estimated room and board reimbursement claim denials in patient care expenses 
we refer to this difference as nursing home costs  net 
our nursing home costs  net  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries  payroll taxes  benefits and travel costs associated with our staff that is not directly involved with patient care  bonuses for all employees  marketing  office leases  and professional services 
stock based compensation certain employee stock options which we granted in and have resulted in and will continue to result in stock based compensation charges 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations  if an employee stock option is granted with an exercise price which is less than the deemed fair value of the underlying stock  the difference is treated as a compensation charge that must be recognized ratably over the vesting period for the option 
as a result of employee option grants made in and with exercise prices determined to be less than the deemed fair value of our common stock on the respective grant dates  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  in   in and  in in addition  a stock option granted to our chief executive officer in november was subject to variable accounting due to the vesting provisions contained in the option and resulted in  of stock based compensation expense in in february  the vesting on the option granted to our chief executive officer was accelerated in full  resulting in million of compensation expense which was recognized in the first quarter of as of december   we had accrued a total of  of deferred stock based compensation relating to the foregoing options 
capitalized software development costs we have capitalized certain internal costs related to the development of software used in our business 
we capitalize all qualifying internal costs incurred during the application development stage 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation operation stage are expensed as incurred 
as of december   we had total capitalized software development costs  net of amortization  of approxi mately million 
we amortize the capitalized software development costs related to particular software over a three year period commencing when that software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
approximately million of our capitalized software development costs as of december  related to our new billing software  which we started to amortize in the fourth quarter of goodwill goodwill from our and acquisitions  net of accumulated amortization  was million as of december  prior to  we were amortizing the goodwill from our acquisitions over years 
rules issued by the financial accounting standards board  effective beginning in  require that we no longer amortize goodwill 
these rules require that we analyze our goodwill for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances arise that indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds its fair market value 
we have concluded that no basis for impairment of our goodwill existed as of december  adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda consists of net loss income before accrued preferred stock dividends  excluding net interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation charges 
we present adjusted ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
adjusted ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
in addition  we provide our adjusted ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find adjusted ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our cash flows from operations  for comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net loss income  cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities  or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity 
because adjusted ebitda is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of performance of other companies
