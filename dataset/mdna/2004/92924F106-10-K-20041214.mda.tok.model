table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued executive overview introduction wgl holdings  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  sells and delivers natural gas and provides a variety of energy related products and services to customers primarily in washington  dc and the surrounding metropolitan areas in maryland and virginia 
the company s core subsidiary  washington gas  is involved in the delivery and sale of natural gas that primarily is regulated by state regulatory commissions 
through the wholly owned  unregulated subsidiaries of washington gas resources corporation washington gas resources  the company also offers energy related products and services that are closely related to its core business 
in response to changes in federal and state regulation  the company has taken the initiative to offer competitively priced natural gas and electricity to customers through its unregulated retail energy marketing subsidiary 
wgl holdings has three operating segments that are described below regulated utility  retail energy marketing  and commercial heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac products and services 
transactions not specifically identifiable in one of the above three segments are accumulated and reported in the category other activities 
regulated utility 
with approximately percent of the company s consolidated total assets  the regulated utility segment represented by washington gas and hampshire gas company hampshire delivers natural gas to retail customers in accordance with tariffs approved by the district of columbia  maryland and virginia regulatory commissions that have jurisdiction over washington gas rates 
these rates are intended to provide the regulated utility with an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the investment devoted to the delivery of natural gas to customers 
washington gas also sells natural gas to customers who have not elected to purchase natural gas from unregulated third party marketers 
the regulated utility does not earn a profit or incur a loss when it sells the natural gas commodity because utility customers are charged for the natural gas commodity at the same cost the regulated utility incurs 
at september   the regulated utility was selling and delivering the natural gas commodity to percent of its customers 
the remaining percent of washington gas customers utilized the delivery services of washington gas for delivery of the natural gas commodity purchased from third party marketers  one of which is a subsidiary of washington gas resources 
factors critical to the success of the regulated utility include operating a safe  reliable natural gas distribution system  and recovering the costs and expenses of this business in the rates it charges to customers 
these costs and expenses include a just and reasonable rate of return on invested capital as authorized by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s rates 
hampshire  a wholly owned subsidiary of wgl holdings  operates an underground natural gas storage facility that is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
washington gas purchases all of the storage services of hampshire and includes the cost of these services in the bills sent to its customers 
hampshire operates under a pass through cost of service based tariff approved by the ferc  and adjusts its billing rates to washington gas on a periodic basis to account for changes in its investment in utility plant and associated expenses 
retail energy marketing 
washington gas energy services  inc wgeservices  a wholly owned subsidiary of washington gas resources  competes with other unregulated third party marketers by selling natural gas and electricity directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers  both inside and outside of the regulated utility s traditional service territory 
wgeservices does not own or operate any natural gas or electric generation  transmission or distribution assets 
rather  it sells natural gas and electricity with the objective of earning a profit  and these commodities are delivered to retail customers through the assets owned by regulated utilities such as washington gas or other unaffiliated natural gas or electric utilities 
factors critical to the success of the retail energy marketing business are managing the market risk of the difference between the sales price committed to customers under sales contracts and the cost of natural gas and electricity needed to satisfy these sales commitments  managing credit risks associated with customers of and suppliers to this segment  and controlling the level of selling  general and administrative costs  most notably customer acquisition costs

two wholly owned subsidiaries  american combustion industries  inc aci and washington gas energy systems  inc 
wgesystems  provide turnkey  design build and renovation projects to the commercial and government markets 
as a result of a restructuring agreement on september  and a final closing on october  between the company and a percent investor  the company no longer has any investment in or any financial commitment to its former residential hvac investment 
the commercial hvac operations focus on retrofitting a large number of aging commercial and government structures  primarily in the district of columbia and portions of maryland and virginia 
factors critical to the success of the commercial hvac business include generating adequate revenue from the government and private sectors in the new construction and retrofit markets  estimating and managing fixed price contracts and controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
refer to the business section under item of this report for a further discussion of the company s regulated utility and unregulated businesses 
for a further discussion of the company s financial performance by operating segment  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance management believes that the following are key indicators for monitoring the company s financial condition and operating performance return on average common equity 
this measure is calculated by dividing net income applicable to common stock by average common shareholders equity 
for the regulated utility  management compares the actual return on common equity with the return on common equity that is allowed to be earned by regulators and the return on equity that is necessary for the company to compensate investors sufficiently and be able to continue to attract capital 
common equity ratio 
this ratio is calculated by dividing total common shareholders equity by the sum of common shareholders equity  preferred stock and long term debt including current maturities 
maintaining this ratio in the mid percent range affords the company financial flexibility and access to long term capital at relatively low costs 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources general factors affecting liquidity section of management s discussion for a discussion of the company s capital structure 
primary factors affecting wgl holdings and washington gas the following is a summary discussion of the primary factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of the regulated and unregulated businesses of wgl holdings and washington gas 
refer to the business section under item of this report for a more detailed discussion of these and other related factors that affect the operations and or financial performance of wgl holdings and washington gas 
weather conditions the company s regulated utility operations are weather sensitive  with a significant portion of its revenues derived from the delivery of natural gas to residential and commercial heating customers during the winter season 
weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered by the regulated utility 
the regulated utility s rates are determined on the basis of expected normal weather conditions 
as such  deviations in weather from normal levels can affect the company s financial performance 
washington gas does not have a ratemaking provision that allows for revenues to be adjusted for the difference between actual weather conditions in a particular year and the expected normal weather conditions that are used to establish rates 
however  the regulated utility does have a weather insurance policy designed to protect against a portion of warmer than normal weather refer to market risk included herein for a further discussion of this weather insurance policy 
the financial results of the company s energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  also are affected by deviations in weather from normal levels 
since wgeservices sells both natural gas and electricity  wgeservices financial results may fluctuate due to deviations in weather from fiscal year to fiscal year during the winter heating and summer cooling seasons 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued regulatory environment washington gas is regulated by the public service commission of the district of columbia psc of dc  the public service commission of maryland psc of md and the state corporation commission of virginia scc of va 
hampshire is regulated by the ferc 
these regulatory commissions set the rates in their respective jurisdictions that washington gas can charge customers for its rate regulated services 
changes in these rates as ordered by regulatory commissions affect the company s financial performance 
washington gas expects that regulatory commissions will continue to set the prices and terms for delivery service that give it an opportunity to earn a just and reasonable rate of return on the capital invested in its distribution system and to recover reasonable operating expenses 
gas supply and storage capacity natural gas supply and capacity requirements 
washington gas is responsible for acquiring both sufficient natural gas supplies and interstate pipeline capacity to meet customer requirements 
as such  washington gas must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity to its distribution system  while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline capacity market  its own on system peaking facilities  as well as the characteristics of its customer base 
local distribution companies  such as washington gas  along with other participants in the energy industry have raised concerns regarding the gradual depletion in the availability of additional interstate pipeline capacity 
depleting pipeline capacity is a business issue that must be managed by washington gas  whose customer base has grown at an annual rate of two to three percent 
this rate of growth is expected to continue 
to help maintain the adequacy of pipeline capacity for its growing customer base  washington gas contracted with an interstate pipeline company to construct additional capacity for firm transportation and storage services to washington gas 
this pipeline construction project was completed and placed in service for the winter heating season 
washington gas will continue to monitor other opportunities to acquire or participate in obtaining additional pipeline capacity that will improve or maintain the high level of service expected by its customer base 
washington gas believes the combination of the natural gas supply it can purchase under short term contracts  its existing and planned peaking supplies and the capacity held under contract on the interstate pipelines is sufficient to satisfy the needs of existing customers and allow for growth in future years 
washington gas anticipates enhancing its peaking capacity through the construction of a liquefied natural gas peaking facility refer to liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures for a further discussion of this matter 
rising natural gas prices 
recently there have been significant increases in the price of natural gas  the price of natural gas remains volatile 
price increases have been driven by an increased demand for natural gas that is exceeding the growth in available supply each year 
washington gas believes that there will be sufficient supplies of natural gas to fully meet current customers demand for natural gas and to grow its customer base in the future 
price increases  however  have resulted in significant increases in the cost of natural gas billed to customers that  if continued  could shift customers preference away from natural gas and towards other energy sources such as electricity 
price increases could also make it more difficult for customers to pay their bills and thereby could increase the regulated utility s level of bad debt expense 
changes in natural gas consumption 
natural gas supply requirements may be affected by changes in natural gas consumption by customers 
natural gas usage per customer may decline as customers change their consumption patterns in response to i more volatile and higher natural gas prices  as discussed above  and ii customers replacement of older  less efficient gas appliances with more efficient appliances 
in each jurisdiction in which washington gas operates  changes in customer usage profiles have been reflected in recent rate case proceedings where rates have been adjusted to reflect current customer usage 
changes in customer usage by existing customers that occur subsequent to these recent rate case proceedings will have the effect of reducing revenues  which is offset by the favorable effect of adding new customers 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued competitive environment competition with other energy products 
the regulated utility faces competition based on customers preference for natural gas compared to other energy products and the comparative prices of those products 
the most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential market 
the residential market generates a significant portion of the regulated utility s net income 
in its service territory  washington gas continues to attract the majority of the new residential construction market 
the company believes that consumers continuing preference for natural gas allows washington gas to maintain a strong market presence 
in the interruptible market  the regulated utility s customers must be capable of using a fuel other than natural gas when demand peaks for the regulated utility s firm customers 
in the interruptible market  fuel oil is the prevalent energy alternative to natural gas 
the regulated utility s success in this market depends largely on the relationship between natural gas and oil prices 
since the supply of natural gas primarily is derived from domestic sources  the relationship between supply and demand generally has the greatest impact on natural gas prices 
since a large portion of oil comes from foreign sources  political events can have significant influences on oil supplies and  accordingly  oil prices 
the anticipated introduction of non domestic supplies of liquefied natural gas into the united states natural gas market may affect supply levels and have an impact on natural gas prices 
to date  the effect of liquefied natural gas on supply levels has been minimal 
deregulation and unbundling 
in each of the jurisdictions served by the company s regulated utility  regulators and utilities have implemented customer choice programs 
these programs provide customers with an opportunity to choose to purchase their natural gas and or electric commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchasing these commodities as part of a bundled service from the local utility 
when customers choose to purchase their natural gas commodity from third party marketers on an unbundled basis  there is no effect on the regulated utility s net revenues or net income since washington gas charges its customers the cost of gas without any mark up 
however  these customer choice programs provide unregulated third party marketers  such as wgeservices  with opportunities to profit from the sale of the natural gas commodity or electricity in competitive markets 
it also enables customers to have competitive choices for natural gas and electricity 
successfully participating in this evolving marketplace also poses risks and challenges that must continue to be addressed in the company s current and future strategies 
currently  the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and interstate pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas  including both the commodity cost of gas and the interstate pipeline services  applicable to firm customers 
if washington gas were to determine that competition or changing regulation stemming from future unbundling or other initiatives would preclude it from recovering these costs in rates  these costs would be charged to expense without any corresponding revenue recovery 
depending upon the timing  the effect of such a charge on washington gas financial position and results of operations would likely be significant 
in the event that a regulatory body disallows the recovery of such costs  these costs would be borne by shareholders 
to manage this risk  washington gas has mechanisms in its customer choice programs that enable it to assign to participating third party marketers percent of the storage and peak winter capacity resources that were dedicated to serving bundled service customers when those customers elected a third party marketer 
additionally  washington gas currently has mechanisms approved by each of its local commissions to assign certain percentages of transportation capacity resources 
washington gas generally is renewing pipeline transportation and storage capacity contracts to meet its forecasts of increased customer gas requirements and to comply with regulatory mechanisms to provide for or make available such resources to marketers serving customers in the customer choice programs 
unregulated retail energy marketing 
the company s unregulated subsidiary  wgeservices  competes with other third party marketers to sell the unregulated natural gas commodity to customers 
marketers of the natural gas commodity compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices also competes with other third party marketers to sell electric supply services to customers 
as with natural gas  marketers of electric supply service compete largely on price  and gross margins are relatively small 
wgeservices is exposed to market risks associated with its gas supply  as well as credit risks associated with both its gas and electric suppliers 
see market risk and credit risk included herein for a further discussion of this risk exposure and wgeservices management of them 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued environmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations related to environmental matters 
these evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long timeframe to control environmental effects 
washington gas believes  at this time  that appropriate remediation has been or is being undertaken at all the relevant sites 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of these matters 
industry consolidation in recent years  the energy industry has seen a number of consolidations  combinations  disaggregations and strategic alliances 
consolidation will present combining entities with the challenges of remaining focused on the customer and integrating different organizations 
others in the energy industry are discontinuing operations in certain portions of the energy industry or divesting portions of their business and facilities 
from time to time  the company performs studies and  in some cases  holds discussions regarding utility and energy related investments and strategic transactions with other companies 
the ultimate effect on the company of any such investments and transactions that may occur cannot be determined at this time 
economic conditions and interest rates the company and its subsidiaries operate in one of the fastest growing regions in the nation 
the continued prosperity of this region  supported by a relatively low interest rate environment for new housing  has allowed the company s regulated utility to expand its regulated delivery service customer base at a rate of growth well over twice the national industry average during the past five years 
in addition  this economy has provided a robust market for the company s subsidiaries to market natural gas  electricity and other energy related products and services 
a downturn in the economy of the region in which the company operates  or a significant increase in interest rates which cannot be predicted with accuracy  might adversely affect the company s ability to grow its regulated utility customer base and other businesses at the same rate they have grown in the past 
the company has been operating in a relatively low interest rate environment in the recent past as it relates to short and long term debt financings 
a rise in interest rates without the recognition of the higher cost of debt in the rates charged by the regulated utility to its customers would adversely affect future earnings 
a rise in short term interest rates would negatively affect the results of operations of the company s retail energy marketing segment which depends on short term debt to finance its accounts receivable and storage gas inventories 
inflation deflation from time to time  the company s regulated utility seeks approval for rate increases from regulatory commissions to help it manage the effects of inflation on its capital investment and returns 
the most significant impact of inflation is on the regulated utility s replacement cost of plant and equipment 
while the regulatory commissions  having jurisdiction over the regulated utility s retail rates  allow depreciation only on the basis of historical cost to be recovered in rates  the company anticipates that its regulated utility should be allowed to recover the increased costs of its investment and earn a return thereon  after replacement of the facilities occurs 
to the extent the company s regulated utility experiences a sustained deflationary economic environment  actual returns on invested capital could rise and exceed returns allowed by regulators in previous regulatory proceedings 
if this were to occur  it could prompt the initiation of a regulatory review to reduce the revenue of the regulated utility 
labor contracts  including labor and benefit costs the company has five labor contracts with three labor unions 
teamsters local union no 
local  afl cio  is a local union affiliated with the international brotherhood of teamsters 
on june   local signed a new three year labor contract with washington gas  replacing its previous labor contract that expired on may  the contract covers approximately employees 
the provisions of the new labor contract include general wage increases of percent per year on june   june  and june  additionally  the contract contains a

increases in contributions by employees for medical and prescription drug benefit co pays are also included in the labor contract 
on july   local  representing union eligible employees in the shenandoah gas division  signed a three year labor contract with washington gas 
this contract covers employees 
the contract with the office and professional employees international union local is a three year contract that began on april   and it currently covers approximately members 
additionally  the company has two three year labor contracts with the international brotherhood of electrical workers local that together cover approximately employees 
potential changes in accounting principles the company cannot predict the effect of potential future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general on its operating results and financial condition 
new accounting standards could be issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or the securities and exchange commission sec that could change the way the company records and recognizes revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
these changes in accounting standards could affect the company s reported earnings or increase its liabilities 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires the selection and the application of appropriate technical accounting rules to the relevant facts and circumstances of the company s operations  as well as the use of estimates by management to compile the consolidated financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies involves judgment regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events  including the likelihood of success of particular regulatory initiatives  the likelihood of realizing estimates for legal and environmental contingencies  and the probability of recovering costs and investments in both the regulated utility and non utility operations 
the company has identified five critical accounting policies discussed below that require management s judgment and estimation  where such estimates have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for utility revenue and cost of gas recognition for regulated deliveries of natural gas  washington gas reads meters and bills customers on a cycle basis 
it accrues revenues for gas that has been delivered but not yet billed at the end of an accounting period 
such revenues are recognized as unbilled revenues that are adjusted in subsequent periods when actual meter readings are taken 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain mechanisms that provide for the recovery of the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
under these mechanisms  the regulated utility periodically adjusts its firm customers rates to reflect increases and decreases in the invoice cost of gas 
annually  the regulated utility reconciles the difference between the total gas costs collected from firm customers and the invoice cost of gas 
the regulated utility defers any excess or deficiency and either recovers it from  or refunds it to  customers over a subsequent twelve month period 
accounting for regulatory operations regulatory assets and liabilities a significant portion of the company s business is subject to regulation 
as the regulated utility industry continues to address competitive market issues  the cost of service regulation used to compensate the company s regulated utility for the cost of its regulated operations will continue to evolve 
non traditional ratemaking initiatives and market based pricing of products and services could have additional long term financial implications for the company 
management has relied on its projection of continued regulatory oversight of its operations in order to validate the carrying cost of the regulated utility s investment in fixed assets 
washington gas accounts for its regulated activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which results in differences in the application of gaap between regulated and non regulated businesses 
sfas no 
requires the recording of regulatory 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued assets and liabilities for certain transactions that would have been treated as revenue and expense in unregulated businesses 
in certain circumstances  sfas no 
allows entities whose rates are determined by third party regulators to defer costs as regulatory assets on the balance sheet to the extent that the entity expects to recover these costs in future rates 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could result in the company and washington gas discontinuing the application of sfas no 
for some of its businesses and require the write off of the portion of any regulatory asset or liability that would be no longer probable of recovery or refund 
in effect  the company s regulated utility could be required to write off certain regulatory assets that had been deferred on the consolidated balance sheets in prior periods  and charge these costs to expense at the time it determines that the provisions of sfas no 
no longer apply 
if wgl holdings or washington gas were required to discontinue the application of sfas no 
for any of its operations  it would record an extraordinary non cash charge to income for the net book value of its regulatory assets and liabilities 
other adjustments might also be required 
management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas no 
for the company s regulatory activities  and that all of its regulatory assets and liabilities as of september  and are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the company recognizes deferred income taxes for all temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently enacted income tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires recognition of the additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators prohibit deferred income tax treatment for ratemaking purposes of the regulated utility 
regulatory assets or liabilities corresponding to such additional deferred tax assets or liabilities may be recorded to the extent the company believes they will be recoverable from or payable to customers through the ratemaking process 
amounts applicable to income taxes due from and due to customers primarily represent differences between the book and tax basis of net utility plant in service 
any significant differences between management s estimates and actual tax amounts could have a material impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
accounting for contingencies the company recognizes contingent liabilities utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
by their nature  the amount of the contingency and the timing of a contingent event are subject to management s judgment of such events and management s estimates of the amounts 
actual results related to contingencies may be difficult to predict and could differ significantly from the estimates included in reported earnings 
in fiscal years and  the company was involved with regulatory contingencies with respect to pending rate cases in virginia 
under the regulations of the scc of va  washington gas placed a proposed revenue increase into effect november   subject to refund pending the scc of va s final decision on a rate case proceeding 
washington gas financial results for fiscal year reflected the proposed revenue increase  along with a provision for rate refunds to customers based on the difference between the amount washington gas had collected in rates subject to refund during fiscal year and the estimated amount management expected to recover based on the final outcome of the rate case proceeding 
on december   a final order was issued by the scc of va which approved an increase in rates that approximated the amount that management had estimated would be derived from this case 
refunds to customers  with interest  were made pursuant to the final order during the quarter ended march  the difference between the amount refunded to customers and the amount of the provision for rate refunds previously recorded by washington gas was not material 
accordingly  this refund had no material effect on earnings for the fiscal year ended september  on february   washington gas placed a proposed revenue increase into effect  subject to refund  pending the scc of va s final decision on an expedited rate case proceeding 
on september   the scc of va issued a final order requiring the company to adjust its billing rates to virginia customers to reflect the level of annual revenues approved pursuant to the december  final order of the scc of va 
refunds to customers  with interest  are being made in the december billing cycle for the amount of the proposed annual revenue increase 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued that had been collected since february  the company s financial results for the nine months ended june  reflected the proposed revenue increase  along with a provision for rate refunds to customers based on management s judgment at that time 
in response to the september  final order  washington gas increased its provision for rate refunds in the quarter ended september  to the full amount of revenues that had been collected subject to refund through september  the increased provision eliminated the revenue increase of million pre tax that was previously included in net income for the nine months ended june  after the additional provision for rate refunds was recorded in the quarter ended september   there was no effect on fiscal year  nor will there be any effect on fiscal year earnings for the rates put into effect subject to refund in february in the december  final order  the scc of va further ordered that an annual earnings test be performed to determine if washington gas has earned in excess of its allowed rate of return on common equity for its virginia operations 
during fiscal year ended september   washington gas recorded additional depreciation expense of million in connection with earnings tests performed 
the amount recorded could change if the va staff differs with management s calculations or methodology 
for further discussion of these regulatory activities and related contingencies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivative instruments the company enters into forward contracts and other related transactions for the purchase of natural gas 
a majority of these contracts qualify as normal purchases and sales  and are exempt from the accounting requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
contracts that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments subject to sfas no 
are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities  as discussed below  while changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not affected by rate regulation are reflected in income 
washington gas also utilizes derivative instruments that are designed to minimize interest rate risk associated with planned issuances of medium term notes mtns 
management s judgment is required in determining the appropriate accounting treatment for washington gas derivative instruments 
this judgment involves various factors  including management s ability to i designate contracts and other activities as derivative instruments subject to the accounting guidelines of sfas no 
 ii derive the estimated fair value of its derivative instruments from period to period based on prices available from external sources and internal modeling techniques and iii determine whether or not its derivative instruments are recoverable from or refundable to customers in future periods 
certain of the company s natural gas forward contracts subject to sfas no 
are valued using models developed by the company 
these models reflect  when appropriate  derivative pricing theory  formulated market inputs and forward price projections beyond the period that prices are available from market data sources 
the fair value derived for these contracts reflects management s best estimate 
as previously discussed  changes in the fair value of forward contracts and other related transactions that qualify as derivative instruments under sfas no 
and subject to sfas no 
are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities since they relate to activities of the regulated utility whose costs are likely to be recovered from or refunded to customers in future periods 
accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities 
should management determine that certain of its derivative instruments are not recoverable or refundable to customers  washington gas financial results may be subject to increased volatility from period to period due to potentially significant changes in the estimated fair value of derivative instruments that may occur and be recorded to either other comprehensive income loss or net income

results of operations summary results wgl holdings reported net income of million  or per share  for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to net income of million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the company earned returns of percent  percent and percent  respectively  on average common equity during each of these three fiscal years 
the operating results of the company s core regulated utility operations are the primary influence on overall consolidated operating results 
weather for fiscal year  when measured by an industry standard called heating degree days  was percent colder than normal  and was estimated to have improved net income in fiscal year in relation to normal weather by million  or per share 
during fiscal year  weather was percent colder than normal  contributing an estimated million  or per share  to net income for that year 
earnings comparisons between the current and prior fiscal year also reflect continued customer growth and the impact of favorable rate decisions  which together increased net income by an estimated per share 
earnings from the company s major non utility operations improved slightly  with the company s retail energy marketing segment increasing its net income over the prior fiscal year by million to million 
this improvement was mostly offset by a million increased net loss incurred by the company s commercial hvac segment  in which its net loss increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year operating results for fiscal year also reflect increased utility operation and maintenance expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expense 
earnings comparisons between fiscal years and also reflect the following transactions related to the company s utility and non utility segments 
fiscal year included i an after tax gain of million  or per share  from the sale of two buildings by a third party in a commercial development project in which the company held a carried interest accounted for under the equity method maritime sale  ii the recognition of additional depreciation expense of million pre tax  or per share  which related to a prior period and was recorded in connection with a virginia rate order  and iii a charge of million  or per share  for an impairment of goodwill related to the company s investment in its hvac business 
fiscal year included i an after tax gain of million  or per share  from the sale of the company s former headquarters property  ii an after tax gain of  or per share  from the sale of a real estate partnership interest  iii a favorable income tax adjustment of million  or per share  and iv a reduction in income taxes of million  or per share  resulting from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards associated with the company s non utility activities 
net income for fiscal year of million  or per share  more than doubled the company s net income reported for fiscal year the significant earnings improvement for fiscal year was attributable primarily to percent colder weather as compared to fiscal year  as well as customer growth  the favorable impact of new retail rates in maryland and virginia and a new rate design in the district of columbia 
the company s non utility operations also contributed to the favorable earnings comparison for fiscal year  primarily due to after tax charges included in fiscal year totaling million  or per share  associated with the company s former co investment in a residential hvac business and a consumer finance business that is no longer making new loans 
additionally  fiscal year benefited from after tax gains from asset sales and favorable tax adjustments  as mentioned above

weather was percent warmer in the current fiscal year than in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year earnings of the regulated utility segment benefited from the addition of  active customer meters  an increase of percent 
further contributing to earnings for the current fiscal year was the impact of rate changes that were implemented in maryland on november   in the district of columbia on november   and the effect of approximately one and one half months of the rate decision that became effective in virginia in november as discussed earlier in critical accounting policies accounting for contingencies  a virginia rate increase also went into effect on february   subject to refund  pending a final decision by the scc of va on an expedited rate case application that washington gas filed on january  the scc of va issued a final order on september  approving a proposed stipulation filed by washington gas and other participants to resolve all issues related to the expedited rate case 
the stipulation resulted in no change to the level of revenues that the company had previously been allowed to collect 
a provision for rate refunds was recorded at september  equivalent to the revenues that the company had collected in fiscal year  subject to refund 
accordingly  there was no effect of this rate case on earnings in fiscal year fiscal year earnings for the regulated utility segment also reflect million of increased operation and maintenance expenses 
the increase in these expenses reflects  among other things  an accrual of million for operational expenses recorded in the current fiscal year for which the company ultimately may be partially or fully reimbursed  the potential reimbursement was not accrued as a receivable as of september  additionally  this increase reflects increased costs associated with employee benefits  employee severance  information technology improvements and other miscellaneous items 
partially offsetting these increases were lower uncollectible accounts expense  and million of lower costs associated with post retirement benefits other than pensions as a result of a law enacted in december that entitles the company to a federal subsidy for sponsoring a retiree health care benefit plan with a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit to be provided under

the effect of this subsidy was applied retroactively to january  in accordance with new accounting guidelines issued in may by the fasb refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the accounting for the medicare subsidy 
further discussion of operation and maintenance expenses of the regulated utility is included herein under management s discussion for washington gas 
the regulated utility segment also incurred million of higher depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year when compared to this higher expense was attributable to increased plant investment  as well as the effect of the december  final order issued by the scc of va 
in connection with the final order  the company recorded additional depreciation expense of million pre tax  or per share  to implement higher depreciation rates applicable to the period from january  through november  additionally  the company recorded million of additional depreciation expense in fiscal year related to the performance of earnings tests as required by the final order in virginia refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s regulatory activities and related contingencies 
in fiscal year  the regulated utility segment reported net income of million  or per share  an increase of million  or per share  over fiscal year this significant increase primarily reflects a percent increase in total gas deliveries to firm customers that grew to billion therms during fiscal year due to colder weather  as well as the addition of  active customer meters during the fiscal year 
weather for fiscal year was percent colder than fiscal year weather was percent colder than normal in fiscal year this compared to percent warmer than normal weather for fiscal year which reduced net income in that year by an estimated million  or per share after considering an million  or per share  benefit derived from a weather insurance policy 
increased earnings for the utility segment in fiscal year also was attributable to new retail rates put into effect in maryland on september  and in virginia on november   as well as the impact of a new rate design in the district of columbia that enabled a greater recovery of fixed charges in the summer months beginning in fiscal year  despite an annual revenue reduction enacted by the psc of dc that became effective in april tempering these earnings improvements were million of increased operation and maintenance expenses and million of increased depreciation and amortization expense 
earnings comparisons for the utility segment for fiscal years  and also were affected by an after tax gain realized in fiscal year of million  or per share  as reflected in other income expense net  from the sale of the company s former headquarters property  and an adjustment to income taxes that improved net income in fiscal year by million  or per share 
fiscal year also included a loss of million  or per share  associated with a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
further discussion of the operating results of the regulated utility is included herein in the management s discussion for washington gas 
non utility operating results the company s non utility operations are comprised of two business segments retail energy marketing and commercial hvac 
certain of the company s transactions are not significant enough to report as stand alone business segments  and therefore are aggregated as other activities which are included as part of non utility operations for purposes of segment reporting refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total net income for the company s non utility operations for fiscal year was million  or per share  an improvement of million  or per share  over fiscal year earnings for the current fiscal year were favorably affected by the realization in fiscal year of an after tax gain of million  or per share  from the maritime sale 
in fiscal year  the company realized an after tax gain of  or per share  from the sale of a real estate partnership interest  and benefited from a favorable adjustment to income taxes of million  or per share  resulting from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards 
with respect to the company s two non utility business segments  the retail energy marketing segment contributed million  or per share  to the year over year improvement in earnings from non utility operations  offset by a million  or per share  increased net loss incurred by the commercial hvac segment 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued non utility operations reported net income of million  or per share  for fiscal year ended september   as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal year this significant improvement of million  or per share  was primarily attributable to after tax charges totaling million  or per share  that were recorded in fiscal year for which there were not similar charges recorded in fiscal year these charges included a million  or per share  after tax operating loss and a million  or per share  after tax impairment provision associated with the company s former percent equity investment in primary investors  a residential hvac business 
additionally included in fiscal year was a million  or per share  after tax loan loss provision associated with a consumer finance business  which has stopped accepting new loans 
the following table depicts the composition of the changes in revenues for the non utility business segments 
composition of non utility revenue changes increase decrease compared to prior year in millions retail energy marketing commercial hvac retail energy marketing 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  was established in  and sells natural gas and electricity on an unregulated  competitive basis directly to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
revenues for this segment have grown over the past three years 
retail energy marketing revenues were million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
wgeservices gas sales volumes totaled billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal year  compared to bcf and bcf in fiscal years and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment had approximately   and  natural gas customers at september   and  respectively 
wgeservices sold billion kilowatt hours kwh of electricity in fiscal year  compared to billion kwh and billion kwh in fiscal years and  respectively 
electricity was provided to approximately  customers at september   compared to  and  customers at september  and  respectively 
the retail energy marketing segment reported record net income of million  or per share  for fiscal year  more than double its net income for fiscal year this segment s year over year improvement of million  or per share  reflects higher gross margins from the sale of natural gas  partially offset by lower gross margins from the sale of electricity 
natural gas sales volumes increased by less than one percent over fiscal year  however gross margins per therm sold increased percent 
gross margins from natural gas sales were reduced in fiscal year in comparison to fiscal year due to the colder than normal weather experienced during the winter heating season that resulted in the need to make additional purchases of natural gas at higher prices in the spot market in order to meet commitments to customers 
during fiscal year  wgeservices earned higher than historical gross margins on its natural gas sales  reflecting additional business that was secured in the form of large government and commercial customers 
additionally  the current fiscal year reflects the full scale operation of a regional liquefied natural gas importation facility that introduced large volumes of gas into the local market  putting downward pressure on wgeservices gas supply costs 
lower gross margins from electric sales for the current fiscal year resulted from an percent decline in kilowatt hours sold due to a reduction in the number of lower margin residential customers served based on company decisions not to renew certain contracts 
lower gross margins also reflect a reduction in commercial customers as competition for large commercial customers intensified and as rising energy prices encouraged some electric customers to return to below market standard offer service provided by the incumbent electric utility 
looking ahead  in the near term  future opportunities to add new electric customers may be limited 
new standard offer service sos rates that went into effect in july for maryland electric utilities are below current market prices 
these electric utilities entered into contracts to supply their sos customers with electricity in february  prior to a large surge in fuel prices 
in the long term  however  sos rates in maryland  and soon in the district of columbia  will be 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued reset to market rates through annual procurements  and thereby are expected to offer continuing opportunities to build the electric customer base 
given the higher than historical gross margins on natural gas sales earned in fiscal year that may not be repeated in fiscal year  coupled with the uncertainties regarding the short term outlook for electric sales  the company does not foresee a continuation of the same level of profitability from the retail energy marketing segment in fiscal year as was experienced in fiscal year net income for the retail energy marketing segment was million for fiscal year  or per share  as compared to net income of million  or per share  for fiscal year the decline in fiscal year was largely caused by a rapid rise in natural gas prices that occurred in late february and early march of fiscal year that was more extreme than the planning parameters prescribed in the company s risk management policy 
consequently  the colder than normal weather experienced in fiscal year resulted in the need to make additional purchases of natural gas in the spot market at a cost above its retail selling price to meet its commitments to customers  thereby reducing gross margins 
gross margins from electricity sales increased due to a percent increase in volumes sold  and a percent higher gross margin per kilowatt hour 
commercial hvac 
two subsidiaries  aci and wgesystems  offer large scale hvac installations and related services to commercial and government customers 
these subsidiaries comprise the company s commercial hvac segment 
revenues for the commercial hvac segment were million for fiscal year  as compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
this comparison reflects the reduction in work performed on behalf of one major customer  the federal government  as well as an overall decrease in business activity 
in fiscal year  and  the company generated revenues of approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  from the federal government 
for fiscal year  this segment incurred a net loss of million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal year and net income of million  or per share  in fiscal year these comparisons primarily reflect reduced revenues  lower gross margins and  in fiscal year  the recognition of a charge of million  or per share  for the impairment of goodwill related to the company s investment in this business 
other non utility activities 
as previously discussed  some of the company s transactions are not significant enough on a stand alone basis to warrant treatment as a business segment 
for purposes of segment reporting  these transactions are aggregated as other activities and included as part of non utility operations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results for other non utility activities of the company for fiscal year reflect a million improvement in net income over fiscal year  primarily due to the inclusion in the current fiscal year of the after tax earnings of million  or per share  realized from the maritime sale 
in fiscal year  the company realized an after tax gain of  or per share  from the sale of a real estate partnership interest  and benefited from a favorable adjustment to income taxes of million  or per share  resulting from the utilization of capital loss carryforwards 
operating results from other non utility activities for fiscal year improved million  or per share  over fiscal year due primarily to a million  or per share  loan loss provision recorded in fiscal year associated with a consumer finance business that has stopped accepting new loans 
favorably affecting fiscal year results were the after tax gain of  or per share from the sale of the real estate partnership  and the favorable tax adjustment of million  or per share 
other income expenses net other income expenses net improved by million in fiscal year over fiscal year the improvement in income was attributable primarily to the after tax earnings of million realized in the current fiscal year from the maritime sale  and increased interest income earned on higher short term investment balances  partially offset by other charges 
in fiscal year  the company realized after tax gains of million from the sale of its headquarters property and  from the sale of a real estate partnership interest 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income expense net improved by  in fiscal year over fiscal year this improvement was primarily the result of after tax gains of million and  realized from the real estate sales  as discussed above 
the favorable comparison over fiscal year was also attributable to the inclusion in of million of after tax expenses related to uncollectible accounts  as well as an after tax loss of million associated with a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
substantially all of these improvements were offset by million of after tax benefits recorded in fiscal year for the proceeds from a weather insurance policy 
there were no weather insurance proceeds recorded in fiscal years and interest expense interest expense incurred by wgl holdings and its subsidiaries of million for the year ended september  decreased million from fiscal year  and increased  in fiscal year over mtns  that comprise substantially all of the company s long term debt  had a weighted average cost of percent  percent and percent at september   and  respectively 
the following table shows the components of the changes in interest expense between years 
composition of interest expense changes increase decrease compared to prior year in millions long term debt short term debt other includes afudc total represents allowance for funds used during construction 
the million decrease in wgl holdings interest expense for fiscal year is due primarily to reduced interest costs on long term debt  reflecting a decrease in the average balance of long term debt outstanding  coupled with a decrease in the weighted average cost of these borrowings 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal year compared to primarily stems from increased interest costs on long term debt due to an increase in the average balance of long term debt outstanding  partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average cost of these borrowings 
reduced interest costs related to short term borrowings for fiscal year when compared to reflects a decrease in the average balance outstanding  combined with a decrease in the weighted average cost of short term debt 
liquidity and capital resources general factors affecting liquidity it is important for the company to have access to short term debt markets to maintain satisfactory liquidity to operate its businesses on a near term basis 
acquisition of natural gas  electricity  pipeline capacity  and the need to finance accounts receivable are the most significant short term financing requirements of the company 
the need for long term capital is driven primarily by capital expenditures and maturities of long term debt 
significant swings can take place in the level of short term debt required by the company due primarily to changes in the price and volume of natural gas and electricity purchased to satisfy customer demand  and also due to seasonal cash collections on accounts receivable 
backup financing to the company s commercial paper program in the form of revolving credit agreements enables the company to maintain access to short term debt markets 
the ability of the company to obtain such financing depends on its credit ratings  which are greatly affected by the company s financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets 
also potentially affecting access to short term debt capital is the nature of any restrictions that might be placed upon the company such as ratings triggers or a requirement to provide creditors with additional credit support in the event of a determination of insufficient creditworthiness 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the ability to procure sufficient levels of long term capital at reasonable costs is determined by the level of the company s capital expenditure requirements  its financial performance  and the effect of these factors on its credit ratings and investment alternatives available to investors 
the company has a goal to maintain its common equity ratio in the mid percent range of total consolidated capital 
in addition  the company typically reduces short term debt balances in the spring because a significant portion of the company s current assets is converted into cash at the end of the winter heating season 
accomplishing these capital structure objectives and maintaining sufficient cash flow are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings for the company and washington gas  and to allow access to capital at reasonable costs 
as of september   total consolidated capitalization  including current maturities of long term debt and excluding notes payable  comprised percent common equity  percent preferred stock and percent long term debt 
the cash flow requirements of the company and the ability to provide satisfactory resources to satisfy those requirements are primarily influenced by the activities of washington gas and to a lesser extent the non utility operations 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy its financial obligations 
at september   the company did not have any restrictions on its cash balances that would affect the payment of common or preferred stock dividends by wgl holdings or washington gas 
short term cash requirements and related financing the regulated utility s business is weather sensitive and seasonal  causing short term cash requirements to vary significantly during the year 
over percent of the total therms delivered in the regulated utility s service area excluding deliveries to two electric generation facilities occur during the first and second fiscal quarters 
cash requirements peak in the fall and winter months when accounts receivable  accrued utility revenues and storage gas inventories are at their highest levels 
after the winter heating season  many of these assets are converted into cash  which the company generally uses to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  has seasonal short term cash requirements resulting from its need to purchase storage gas inventory in advance of the period in which the storage gas is sold 
in addition  wgeservices must continually pay its suppliers of natural gas and electricity before it collects its accounts receivable balances resulting from these sales 
both the regulated utility and the retail energy marketing segment maintain storage gas inventory 
wgeservices maintains storage gas inventory that is assigned to it by natural gas utilities such as washington gas 
storage gas inventories represent gas purchased from producers and stored in facilities primarily owned by interstate pipelines 
the regulated utility and retail energy marketing subsidiary generally pay for storage gas between heating seasons and withdraw it during the heating season 
significant variations in storage gas balances between years are possible  and are usually caused by the price paid to producers and marketers  which is a function of short term market fluctuations in gas costs 
for the regulated utility  such costs become a component of the cost of gas recovered from customers when volumes are withdrawn from storage 
in addition  the regulated utility is able to specifically earn and recover its pre tax cost of capital related to the varying level of the storage gas inventory balance it carries in each of the three jurisdictions in which it operates 
variations in the timing of collections of gas costs under the regulated utility s gas cost recovery mechanisms and the level of refunds from pipeline companies that will be returned to customers can significantly affect short term cash requirements 
at september   the regulated utility had a million net over collection of gas costs compared to a million under collection at september  the change from the prior year was primarily due to the collection of the balance at september  during fiscal year  coupled with an excess of gas costs recovered from customers over gas costs paid to suppliers 
washington gas reflects the amounts under collected and over collected in the captions gas costs due from customers and gas costs due to customers  respectively  in its balance sheets 
most of the current balance will be collected from  or returned to customers  in fiscal year at september  and  refunds received from pipelines and to be returned to the regulated utility s customers were not material 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company and washington gas utilize short term debt in the form of commercial paper or unsecured short term bank loans to fund seasonal requirements 
the company s policy is to maintain back up bank credit facilities in an amount equal to or greater than its expected maximum commercial paper position 
effective april   washington gas and wgl holdings entered into new credit agreements with a group of banks in the amount of million each for washington gas and wgl holdings 
the credit facility for washington gas expires on april   and permits the regulated utility to request until april   and the banks to approve  an additional line of credit of million above the original credit limit  for a maximum potential total of million 
the wgl holdings credit facility expires on april   and permits the company to request until april   and the banks to approve  an additional line of credit of million above the original credit limit  for a maximum potential total of million 
as of september   there was no amount outstanding under either the washington gas or wgl holdings credit facility 
at september   the company had outstanding notes payable through the issuance of commercial paper of million as compared to million outstanding at september  the decrease in notes payable was primarily attributable to improved operating cash flows generated by the company s regulated utility during the fiscal year ended september   which reduced the company s need for short term borrowings to fund its working capital requirements 
long term cash requirements and related financing the company s long term cash requirements primarily depend upon the level of capital expenditures  long term debt maturity requirements and decisions to refinance long term debt 
the company devotes the majority of its capital expenditures to adding new regulated utility customers in its existing service area 
at september   washington gas was authorized to issue up to million of long term debt under a shelf registration that was declared effective by the sec on april  on may   washington gas executed a distribution agreement with certain financial institutions for the issuance and sale of debt securities included in the shelf registration statement 
in november  washington gas paid million plus accrued interest to redeem million of percent mtns that were due in fiscal year  and replaced this debt with million of newly issued  percent mtns due in fiscal year the effective cost of the new debt  after considering a gain associated with a derivative instrument entered into in connection with this debt  was percent refer to market risk interest rate risk included herein

ratings triggers and certain debt covenants in the event the long term debt of washington gas is downgraded below certain levels  wgl holdings and washington gas would be required to pay higher facility fees on their revolving credit agreements 
wgl holdings and washington gas pay facility fees on their revolving credit agreements based on the long term debt ratings of washington gas 
there are five different levels of fees 
wgl holdings fees are always at the next highest fee level than the level at which washington gas pays its fees 
if washington gas is at level one  the lowest fee level and a level that implies a credit rating for washington gas of at least aa from moody s and aa from standard poor s  washington gas pays eight basis points and wgl holdings pays nine basis points 
if washington gas is at level four  washington gas pays basis points and wgl holdings pays basis points 
under the revolving credit agreements  the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization can not exceed to percent  and  for wgl holdings  the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense can not fall below to times 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreements  wgl holdings and washington gas are required to inform lenders of changes in corporate existence  financial conditions  litigation and environmental warranties that might have a material adverse effect 
the failure to inform the lenders agent of changes in these areas deemed material in nature might constitute default under the agreement 
a default  if not remedied  may lead to a suspension of further loans and or acceleration in which obligations become immediately due and payable

these estimates reflect likely purchases under various contracts  and may differ from minimum future contractual commitments disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when a customer selects a third party marketer to provide natural gas supply  washington gas generally assigns pipeline and storage capacity to third party marketers to deliver natural gas to washington gas city gate 
in order to provide the gas commodity to customers who do not select a third party marketer  washington gas has a commodity acquisition plan to acquire the natural gas supply to serve the customer 
in connection with this plan  washington gas utilizes an asset manager to acquire the necessary supply to serve these customers 
washington gas commitment to the asset manager is to purchase gas supply through april  at a market price that is tied to various public indices for natural gas 
the contract commitment is related to customer demand  there are no minimum bill commitments  and no amount is included in the table above for these contracts

this operation was limited to servicing existing loans 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accordingly  the cash generated from the consumer financing operation was limited to collection of principal and interest for existing loans that reduced the balances in loan pools that previously were created for sale to commercial banks 
pursuant to the terms under which these loan pools were sold  the company repurchased certain of these loans from the commercial banks totaling million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
financial guarantees 
wgl holdings has guaranteed payments for certain purchases of natural gas and electricity on behalf of the retail energy marketing segment 
at september   these guarantees totaled million 
termination of these guarantees is coincident with the satisfaction of all obligations of wgeservices covered by the guarantees 
wgl holdings also had guarantees totaling million at september  that were made on behalf of certain of its non utility subsidiaries associated with their banking transactions 
for all of its financial guarantees  wgl holdings may cancel any or all future obligations imposed by the guarantees upon written notice to the counterparty  but wgl holdings would continue to be responsible for the obligations that had been created under the guarantees prior to the effective date of the cancellation 
construction project financing 
in october  washington gas contracted with the us general services administration gsa to construct certain facilities at the gsa central plant in washington  dc payments to washington gas for this construction were to be made by the gsa over a year period 
in november  washington gas and general electric capital assurance company gefa entered into a long term financing arrangement  whereby gefa funded this construction project 
as part of this financing arrangement  washington gas assigned to gefa the year stream of payments due from the gsa 
the amount of this long term financing arrangement  including change orders  origination fees and capitalized finance charges was million 
as the long term financing from gefa was funded  washington gas established a note receivable representing the gsa s obligation to remit principal and interest 
upon completion and acceptance of phases of the construction project  washington gas accounts for the transfer of the financed asset as an extinguishment of long term debt and removes both the note receivable and long term financing from its financial statements 
as of september   construction of these facilities was substantially complete 
work on the construction project that has not been completed or accepted by the gsa was valued at million  which represents an obligation on washington gas balance sheet at september  at any time before the contract with the gsa is fully accepted  should there be a contract default  such as  among other things  non payment by the gsa  gefa may call on washington gas to fund the entire unpaid principal in exchange for which washington gas would receive the right to the stream of repayments from the gsa 
once final acceptance by the gsa is made  gefa will have no recourse against the company related to this long term debt 
as of september   the gsa had made all required payments under this long term financing arrangement  and the remaining unpaid principal balance was million 
cash flows provided by operating activities the primary drivers for the company s operating cash flows are cash payments received from gas customers  offset by payments made by the company for gas costs  operation and maintenance expenses  taxes  and interest costs 
current interest expense reflects the favorable effect of relatively low short term interest rates  a condition that could change rapidly 
during the first six months of the company s fiscal year  the company generates a large portion of its annual net income due to the significant volumes of natural gas that are delivered by the regulated utility during the winter heating season 
variations in the level of net income reported for the six month period ended march may be significant because of the variability of weather from one period in a year to the same period in a subsequent year 
generating large sales volumes during the six month period ended march increases accounts receivable from the level at september  likewise  accounts payable increases to pay providers of the natural gas commodity and pipeline capacity 
accounts payable for the natural gas commodity can also vary significantly from one period to the next because of the volatility in the price of natural gas 
since payments for natural gas and pipeline capacity need to be made to suppliers before accounts receivable are collected from customers  the company increases its short term debt financing between september and march storage gas inventories  which usually peak by november  are largely drawn down in the six months ended march  and provide a source of cash as this asset is used to satisfy winter sales demand 
gas costs due from or to customers  as well as deferred purchased gas costs  which represent the 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued difference between gas costs that have been paid to suppliers in the past and what has been collected from customers for these gas costs  can also cause significant variations in cash flows from period to period 
during the last six months of the company s fiscal year  after the winter heating season  the company will generally report a seasonal net loss due to reduced demand for natural gas during this period 
additionally  many of the company s assets  which were increased during the heating season  are converted into cash 
the company generally uses this cash to reduce and sometimes eliminate short term debt  and acquire storage gas for the next heating season 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
a description of certain material changes in cash flow from operating activities from september  to september  is listed below storage gas inventory increased million from september  due to higher natural gas costs and increased storage capacity to accommodate the requirements for the winter heating season 
accounts payable increased million from september  largely to fund higher natural gas and electricity purchases 
higher natural gas purchases are due mostly to higher prices associated with storage injections 
during fiscal year  storage gas inventory rose million from september   primarily due to a dramatic rise in the price of natural gas

to manage this supplier credit risk  washington gas screens suppliers creditworthiness and asks suppliers as necessary for financial assurances  including letters of credit  parental guarantees  and surety bonds to mitigate adverse price exposures that could occur if a supplier defaults 
retail energy marketing operations natural gas 
similar to the regulated utility  certain suppliers that sell gas to wgeservices have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
depending on the future ability of these suppliers to deliver natural gas under existing contracts  wgeservices could be financially exposed for the difference between the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy natural gas  and the cost of any replacement natural gas that may need to be purchased 
wgeservices has a wholesale supplier credit policy that is designed to mitigate wholesale credit risks through a requirement for credit enhancements 
per the terms of this policy  wgeservices has obtained credit enhancements from certain of its gas suppliers 
electricity 
for a discussion of the credit risk associated with wgeservices electricity suppliers  refer to market risk price risk related to retail energy marketing operations included herein 
market risk the company is exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity price risk  weather risk and interest rate risk 
the following discussion describes these risks and the company s management of them 
price risk related to regulated utility operations washington gas actively manages its gas supply portfolio to balance its sales and delivery obligations 
the regulated utility includes the cost of the natural gas commodity and pipeline services in the purchased gas costs that it includes in firm customers rates  subject to regulatory review 
the regulated utility s jurisdictional tariffs contain gas cost mechanisms that allow it to recover the invoice cost of gas applicable to firm customers 
in order to mitigate commodity price risk for its firm customers  washington gas has specific regulatory approval in the district of columbia  maryland and virginia to hedge transactions with option contracts for a limited portion of its natural gas purchases 
three types of hedge instruments were approved for the company s use i forward gas purchases at a fixed price  ii purchases of call options that effectively cap the cost of gas and iii a combination of call options purchased and put options sold that limits gas price exposure within a narrow band 
additionally  the company purchases gas under contracts that provide for volumetric variability 
certain of these contracts are required to be recorded at fair value refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for these derivative instruments 
at september  and  the company recorded a payable on its balance sheet reflecting a fair value loss of million and million  respectively  related to its variable gas purchase contracts  with a corresponding amount recorded as a regulatory asset in accordance with regulatory accounting requirements for a recoverable cost in each jurisdiction 
the regulated utility also mitigates price risk by injecting natural gas into storage during the summer months when prices are generally lower and less volatile  and withdraws that gas during the winter heating season when prices are generally higher and more volatile 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued price risk related to retail energy marketing operations the company s retail energy marketing subsidiary  wgeservices  sells natural gas and electricity to retail customers at both fixed prices and indexed prices 
the company must manage daily and seasonal demand fluctuations for these products 
the volume and price risks are evaluated and measured separately for natural gas and electricity 
natural gas 
wgeservices is exposed to market risk to the extent it does not closely match the timing and volume of natural gas it purchases with the related fixed price or indexed purchase commitments 
wgeservices risk management policies and procedures are designed to minimize these risks 
wgeservices also faces risk in that approximately percent of its annual natural gas sales volumes are subject to variations in customer demand caused by fluctuations in weather 
purchases of natural gas to fulfill retail sales commitments are made generally under fixed volume contracts that are based on normal weather assumptions 
if there is a significant deviation from normal weather that causes purchase commitments to differ significantly from sales levels  wgeservices may be required to buy incremental natural gas or sell excess natural gas at prices that negatively impact gross margins 
wgeservices also manages this volumetric risk by using storage gas inventory and peaking services offered to marketers by the regulated utilities that provide delivery service for wgeservices customers 
wgeservices also manages price risk through the use of derivative instruments 
at september  and  all of wgeservices derivatives were valued at  and  respectively 
for these derivatives  wgeservices recorded net gains of  and  for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  and recorded a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended september  electricity 
for its electric business  wgeservices has significantly limited its volumetric and price risks by purchasing full requirements supply from wholesale electricity suppliers under master purchase and sale agreements 
wgeservices principal supplier of electricity is mirant americas energy marketing lp maem  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of mirant corporation mirant 
wgeservices purchases full requirements services from maem  including electric energy  capacity and certain ancillary services  for resale to retail electric customers 
maem assumes the risk for any volume and price risks associated with sales made by wgeservices 
on july   mirant and substantially all of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
maem was included in these bankruptcy filings 
future performance by maem may be subject to further developments in the bankruptcy proceedings 
the performance risk associated with the pre bankruptcy petition maem contracts is mitigated through a security and escrow agreement entered into between wgeservices and maem prior to the bankruptcy filing 
under the security and escrow agreement  wgeservices has access to collateral that is intended to cover the difference between the current market price of electricity and the price at which wgeservices has contracted to buy electricity 
in the opinion of counsel to the company  wgeservices has the contractual right to draw on the escrow funds in the account which totaled million and million as of september  and  respectively if the pre bankruptcy petition contracts between wgeservices and maem are terminated 
the amount of wgeservices exposure in the event of termination of these contracts between wgeservices and maem is estimated to be less than the amount of collateral included in the escrow account 
this estimate of wgeservices exposure to contract termination is based upon acquiring supply  priced at forward electricity prices through the expiration of the existing sales contracts or until wgeservices exercises certain damage limitation provisions of its customers sales contracts 
the actual exposure for wgeservices may differ from the estimate due to changes in timing of any contract termination  deviations from normal weather  changes in future market conditions  or other factors 
since the bankruptcy filing  maem has continued to honor its supply obligations to wgeservices 
all obligations to wgeservices under the pre bankruptcy petition maem contracts expire by the end of october  with the majority of these obligations expiring by december in october  wgeservices and maem signed a post bankruptcy petition contract that enables wgeservices to renew expiring contracts with its current electric customers and to make purchases for new customers 
these post bankruptcy petition contracts include provisions that allow wgeservices to net payables to maem against any damages that might result from default on the part of maem  and allow wgeservices to request collateral under certain situations 

table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued wgeservices has made efforts to reduce its reliance on a single supplier 
during fiscal year  wgeservices entered into separate master purchase and sale agreements under which it purchases full requirements services from three new wholesale electricity suppliers 
these new electric supplier contracts either have investment grade credit ratings or provide guarantees from companies with investment grade credit ratings 
electric suppliers other than maem accounted for less than ten percent of wgeservices electric purchases for fiscal year value at risk 
wgeservices also measures the market risk of its energy commodity portfolio and employs risk control mechanisms to measure and determine mitigating steps related to market risk including the determination and review of value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of the maximum loss that can be expected at some level of probability if a portfolio is held for a given time period 
for the natural gas portfolio  based on a percent confidence interval  wgeservices value at risk at september  was approximately  for a one day holding period 
wgeservices also calculates the value of its open position related to natural gas  which measures the amount of additional transactions that would be required to close the volumetric differential between its purchase and sales commitments 
as of september   wgeservices would have had to increase its forward purchase commitments by approximately million to close its open position 
weather risk the company is exposed to various forms of weather risk in both of its regulated utility and unregulated businesses 
for the regulated utility  a large portion of the company s revenues is volume driven and its current rates are based upon an assumption of normal weather 
variations from normal weather will cause the company s earnings to increase or decrease  depending on the weather pattern 
the financial results of the company s non regulated energy marketing business  wgeservices  are also affected by variations from normal weather in the winter relating to its gas sales  and in the summer relating to its electricity sales 
the company manages weather risk with a weather insurance policy for the regulated utility and a weather hedge for wgeservices  as discussed below 
weather insurance 
in october  washington gas purchased a weather insurance policy in order to minimize the impact of warmer than normal weather on the company s financial results 
the policy has a five year term that ends september  during fiscal year  the company will evaluate the possibility of obtaining weather insurance when the current policy expires 
the policy covers a portion of washington gas estimated net revenue exposure to variations in heating degree days hdds 
the insurance policy defines a heating degree day as the greater of i degrees fahrenheit less the average of the daily high and daily low temperatures in degrees fahrenheit as measured at washington reagan national airport  or ii zero 
for insurance policy purposes  neither average temperatures nor hdds are rounded 
income is provided in the amount of  for each such hdd below  per fiscal year up to a maximum of hdds  subject to certain limitations 
over the five year term of the policy  washington gas cannot be paid for more than  hdds 
for fiscal year  the fifth and last year of the policy  the full coverage of hdds is available 
additionally  the policy provides for a one time payment to washington gas at the end of the policy term if  over its five year term  hdds average less than  per year 
the maximum remaining one time payment washington gas may receive is an additional  pre tax 
other than the cost of the insurance  washington gas pays nothing if weather is colder than normal 
no payments were received in connection with fiscal years or due to the colder than normal weather 
during fiscal year  weather was percent warmer than normal  resulting in hdds that were covered by the policy 
as a result  washington gas recorded pre tax income in fiscal year due to its receipt of a pre tax payment of million million after income taxes in october  which offset about percent of the estimated financial effect of the year s warmer than normal weather 
the policy s pre tax annual cost was million for fiscal years  and  and will continue at this level for fiscal year no portion of the cost or benefit of this policy is considered in the regulatory process 
a further description of the accounting for weather insurance may be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
when washington gas reports hdds  it computes hdds using a method different from that used for insurance policy purposes 
washington gas method rounds the average of the high and low temperatures to the nearest whole degree prior to subtracting that average from degrees 
as a result  for each fiscal year in the five year policy period  the number of hdds computed for insurance purposes will almost certainly be greater than the number of hdds reported by washington gas 
therefore  the insurance policy computation will indicate colder weather than 
table of contents wgl holdings  inc part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued washington gas computation  and the annual benefit received will be lower than might be expected if washington gas measure of hdds were used 
for example  the fiscal year hdd total for insurance purposes was  but was  under washington gas method 
hdd hedge 
wgeservices utilizes hdd hedges to manage its risk for natural gas customers who participate in a program that allows them to pay a fixed amount for their gas requirements regardless of the amount of gas consumed 
these hedges cover a portion of wgeservices estimated net revenue exposure to variations in hdds 
for fiscal year  the company recorded  net of premium costs  a net loss of  related to these hedges  and a net gain of  for fiscal year no such gain or loss was recorded in fiscal year interest rate risk the company and washington gas are exposed to interest rate risk associated with its debt financing costs 
management of this risk is discussed below 
long term debt 
at september   the regulated utility had fixed rate mtns and other long term debt aggregating million in principal amount  excluding current maturities and unamortized discounts  and having a fair value of million 
fair value is defined as the present value of the debt securities future cash flows discounted at interest rates that reflect market conditions as of september  while these are fixed rate instruments and  therefore  do not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates  they are subject to changes in fair value as market interest rates change 
a total of million  or approximately percent  of the regulated utility s outstanding mtns  excluding current maturities  have put or call options  or a combination of both  allowing either washington gas or the holder of the debt to mitigate this market risk through the early redemption of those debt instruments 
using sensitivity analyses to measure this market risk exposure  the regulated utility estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by ten percent 
the company also estimates that the fair value of its long term debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates were to increase by ten percent 
in general  such an increase or decrease in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
derivative instruments 
washington gas utilizes derivative financial instruments from time to time in order to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
in june  washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of million to mitigate a substantial portion of interest rate risk associated with anticipated future debt transactions 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were carried at fair value 
in november  washington gas terminated million of the total million aggregate notional principal amount of the forward starting swaps concurrent with the november issuance of million of mtns as discussed previously in liquidity and capital resources included herein 
washington gas received million associated with the settlement of this hedge agreement 
in december  washington gas terminated the remaining million aggregate notional principal of the forward starting swaps  and received million associated with the settlement of this hedge agreement 
in september  washington gas entered into two forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of million 
these swaps are intended to mitigate a substantial portion of interest rate risk associated with anticipated future debt transactions  and are scheduled to terminate in fiscal year concurrent with the execution of debt transactions planned for that year 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended  and are carried at fair value 
at september   these swaps had a fair value loss totaling refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the accounting for these transactions 

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued washington gas light company this section of management s discussion focuses on the financial position and results of operations of washington gas for the reported periods 
in many cases  explanations for the changes in financial position and results of operations for both wgl holdings and washington gas are substantially the same 
results of operations summary results washington gas net income applicable to its common stock was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the following table provides the key factors contributing to the changes in utility net revenues between years 
composition of utility net revenue changes increase decrease in millions from prior year gas delivered to firm customers volumetric effect weather customer growth impact of rate cases a gas delivered to interruptible customers other a total a for fiscal year  impact of rate cases includes a million benefit of an accounting tracker granted by the psc of dc related to pension and other post employment benefit expenses  and other excludes this benefit 
utility net revenues net revenues for washington gas were million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year net revenues were affected primarily by weather  which was percent warmer in fiscal year than in fiscal year favorably contributing to net revenues for fiscal year was the addition of  active customer meters  or percent  which increased net revenues by million in the current fiscal year 
net revenues for fiscal year also benefited by million from the impact of rate changes that were implemented in maryland on november   the district of columbia on november   and the effect of approximately one and one half months of the rate decision that became effective in virginia in november included as part of the november  rate increase in the district of columbia was a reduction in rates for the effect of post employment benefit costs that had been previously deferred on the balance sheet as a regulatory liability 
during fiscal year  washington gas refunded over collections of these costs to its district of columbia customers  thereby resulting in a lowering of base rates by the psc of dc for the effect of these over collections 
the effect of this reduction in annual revenues results in an accounting adjustment that reduces both the regulatory liability on the balance sheet and operation and maintenance expenses on the statement of income 
accordingly  the regulatory deferral mechanism or tracker results in no affect on net income as the lower rates reflected in revenues are offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses 
for fiscal year  washington gas net income reflects a million reduction in both its net revenues and operation and maintenance expenses related to this tracker in accordance with the final order by the psc of dc 
for purposes of the table presented above  the million has been included in impact of rate cases and deducted from other for fiscal year 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued utility net revenues of million for fiscal year represented an increase of million  or percent  over fiscal year this increase was attributable primarily to percent colder weather in fiscal year than in fiscal year  along with customer growth 
higher retail rates in maryland and virginia  as well as new rates and a new rate design in the district of columbia  contributed an additional million to the increase in net revenues for fiscal year revenue taxes comprised principally of gross receipts taxes  increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
changes in revenue taxes primarily are impacted by changes in the volume of gas sold and delivered 
although volumes decreased in fiscal year  tax rates charged in maryland and the district of columbia increased significantly in fiscal year the increase in these taxes for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by increased volumes 
the regulated utility is allowed recovery of these amounts from its customers and therefore these fees do not affect total net revenues 
gas deliveries  weather and meter statistics years ended september  gas sales and deliveries thousands of therms firm gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total firm interruptible gas sold and delivered gas delivered for others total interruptible electric generation delivered for others total deliveries degree days actual normal percent colder warmer than normal active customer meters end of period new customer meters added gas service to firm customers 
the level of gas delivered to firm customers is highly sensitive to weather variability as a large portion of the natural gas delivered by washington gas is used for space heating 
the regulated utility s rates are based on normal weather  and none of the tariffs for the jurisdictions in which it operates has a weather normalization provision 
nonetheless  declining block rates in the regulated utility s maryland and virginia jurisdictions  and the existence of a fixed demand charge in all jurisdictions to collect a portion of revenues  reduce the effect that variations from normal weather have on net revenues 
during the fiscal year ended september   firm therm deliveries decreased percent from fiscal year to billion therms 
this decrease primarily reflects percent warmer weather during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  partially offset by a percent increase in active customer meters being served 
weather for fiscal year was percent colder than normal  as compared to percent colder than normal for the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal year  firm therm deliveries increased percent over fiscal year due to percent colder weather in fiscal year than in fiscal year  coupled with an increase in active customer meters 
many customers choose to buy the natural gas commodity from third party marketers  rather than purchase the natural gas commodity and delivery service from washington gas on a bundled basis 
gas delivered to firm 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customers but purchased from third party marketers represented percent of total firm therms delivered during fiscal year  compared to percent and percent delivered during fiscal years and  respectively 
on a per unit basis  washington gas earns the same net revenues from delivering gas for others as it earns from bundled gas sales in which customers purchase both the natural gas commodity and the associated delivery service from washington gas 
therefore  the regulated utility does not experience any loss in net revenues when customers choose to purchase the natural gas commodity from a third party marketer 
gas service to interruptible customers 
washington gas must curtail or interrupt service to this class of customer when the demand by firm customers exceeds specified levels 
therm deliveries to interruptible customers increased percent in fiscal year over fiscal year this is attributable to an increase of million therms in interruptible deliveries for others  reflecting a reduction in the curtailment of interruptible service due to warmer weather in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a reduction in interruptible gas sold and delivered of million therms 
deliveries to interruptible customers during fiscal year decreased by million therms  or percent  from fiscal year primarily due to customers use of alternative fuels or conversion to firm deliveries as a result of higher natural gas prices 
the effect on net income of changes in delivered volumes and prices to the interruptible class is limited by margin sharing arrangements that are included in washington gas rate designs 
under these arrangements  except as noted below as it relates to virginia operations  washington gas shares a majority of the margins earned on interruptible gas sales and deliveries to firm customers after a gross margin threshold is reached 
a portion of the fixed costs for servicing interruptible customers is collected through the firm customer s class in rate design 
in the virginia jurisdiction  washington gas shares only margins on interruptible gas sales to firm customers  interruptible delivery service rates are based on the cost of service  and washington gas retains all revenues from interruptible delivery service 
gas service for electric generation 
washington gas sells and or delivers natural gas for use at two electric generation facilities in maryland that are each owned by companies independent of wgl holdings 
during fiscal year  deliveries to these customers decreased percent to million therms  reflecting the use by these customers of alternative fuels primarily due to higher natural gas prices 
during fiscal year  these deliveries decreased percent to million therms compared to fiscal year washington gas shares a significant majority of the margins earned from gas deliveries to these customers with firm customers 
therefore  changes in the volume of interruptible gas deliveries to these customers do not materially affect either net revenues or net income 
cost of gas the regulated utility s cost of natural gas includes both fixed and variable components 
the regulated utility pays fixed costs or demand charges to pipeline companies for system capacity needed to transport and store natural gas 
the regulated utility pays variable costs  or the cost of the natural gas commodity itself  to natural gas producers 
variations in the utility s cost of gas expense result from changes in gas sales volumes  the price of the gas purchased and the level of gas costs collected through the operation of firm gas cost recovery mechanisms 
under these regulated recovery mechanisms  the regulated utility records cost of gas expense equal to the cost of gas recovered from customers and included in revenues 
the difference between the firm gas costs paid and the gas costs recovered from customers is deferred on the balance sheet as an amount to be collected from or refunded to customers in future periods 
therefore  increases or decreases in the cost of gas associated with sales made to firm customers have no direct effect on net revenues and net income 
revenues can vary widely on an annual basis because of changes in the cost of gas  but such variations will not have any impact on net revenues or net income 
changes in the cost of gas can cause significant variations in the utility s cash provided by or used in operating activities 
the regulated utility receives from or pays to its customers in the district of columbia and virginia  at short term interest rates  carrying costs associated with under or over collected gas costs recovered from its customers 
the commodity costs of gas invoiced to the utility excluding the cost and related volumes applicable to sales made outside of the utility s service territory  referred to as off system sales were  and per therm for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the higher gas costs in fiscal year and reflect higher commodity gas prices associated with greater demand due to colder than normal weather during these years and the increased price volatility in the wholesale market  as discussed above 

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued utility operating expenses operation and maintenance expenses 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million  or percent  from fiscal year to fiscal year  and increased million  or percent  from fiscal year to fiscal year the following table summarizes the major factors that contributed to the changes in operation and maintenance expenses 
composition of operation and maintenance expense changes increase decrease compared to prior year in millions labor and incentive plans employee severance costs employee benefits  excluding the medicare subsidy medicare subsidy uncollectible accounts other non labor operating expenses total expenses related to labor and incentive plans decreased by  in fiscal year primarily due to eight percent fewer employees 
the million increase in employee severance costs during the current fiscal year reflects operational efficiencies at the utility 
labor related expenses increased million in fiscal year primarily due to base pay increases and increased incentive pay accruals related to performance based incentive awards  partially offset by fewer employees 
the million increase in employee benefits expenses for fiscal year was largely due to an increase in the cost of group insurance 
the increase in these costs for fiscal year primarily was due to weaker financial performance related to the company s pension plan  and decreasing interest rates which caused an increase in the discounted liabilities associated with plan benefits 
during fiscal year  the company recorded lower costs associated with post retirement benefits other than pensions of million associated with the medicare subsidy 
this subsidy resulted from a law enacted in december that entitles the company to a federal subsidy for sponsoring a retiree health care benefit plan with a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit to be provided under medicare 
the million decrease in the provision for uncollectible accounts for fiscal year was primarily driven by improved collection efforts by the regulated utility  as well as warmer weather compared to fiscal year the million increase in fiscal year was driven by higher natural gas costs and significantly colder weather in fiscal year than the prior fiscal year 
other non labor operating expenses for fiscal year increased million over fiscal year this increase included an accrual of million for operational expenses recorded in the current fiscal year for which the company ultimately may be partially or fully reimbursed  the potential reimbursement was not accrued as a receivable as of september  additionally  this increase reflects million associated with information technology improvements   for implementing the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act and increases for other miscellaneous items 
the million decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional services and billing related costs that resulted from the implementation of various operational enhancements during fiscal year these cost reductions were slightly offset by higher costs of public liability insurance 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal year rose to million  an increase of million  or percent  over fiscal year this increase reflects increased plant investment to meet continuing customer growth  as well as the effect of a december  final order issued by 
table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the scc of va 
in connection with the final order  the company recorded million pre tax of additional depreciation expense in the current fiscal year to implement higher depreciation rates applicable to the period from january  through november  additionally  the company recorded million of additional depreciation expense in fiscal year related to the performance of earnings tests required by the final order of the scc of va dated december  this earnings test  as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  effectively limits the return on equity of the regulated utility s virginia operations at the allowed return on equity until a regulatory asset established for regulatory accounting purposes is eliminated 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in fiscal year over primarily due to increased plant investment  and higher depreciation rates in effect for the virginia jurisdiction 
the utility s composite depreciation and amortization rate was percent  percent and percent for fiscal years  and  respectively 
general taxes 
general taxes decreased by million from fiscal year and increased by million over fiscal year right of way fees assessed and collected  principally in the district of columbia  primarily are impacted by changes in volumes of gas sold and delivered that decreased in fiscal year and increased in fiscal year income taxes 
the statements of income taxes detail the composition of the change in income tax expense for washington gas 
income taxes for the regulated utility decreased million in fiscal year when compared to primarily due to lower pre tax income 
the million increase in fiscal year over primarily reflects higher pre tax income  partially offset by an adjustment of million that reduced income tax expense in fiscal year other income expenses net other income expenses net reflects net income of million for the fiscal year ended september   as compared to a net expense of  for the year ended september  the million increase in income was primarily attributable to a current year allocation from wgl holdings to washington gas of non operating tax benefits 
this allocation was made in accordance with the tax sharing agreement under which washington gas and all other subsidiaries of wgl holdings participate 
wgl holdings consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effect of this allocation that was eliminated in consolidation 
additionally  fiscal year included a million after tax gain from the sale of the company s headquarters property that resulted in a decrease in income for the current fiscal year 
this was mostly offset by increased interest income earned on higher short term investment balances during fiscal year  as well as by increased other miscellaneous income 
other income expenses net reflected a net expense of  for fiscal year compared to income of  for fiscal year this reduction in income was due primarily to million of after tax benefits realized in fiscal from the proceeds of a weather insurance policy  which was substantially offset by the following factors i a million after tax gain realized in fiscal year related to the sale of the headquarters property  ii a million reduction in fiscal year of after tax expenses related to uncollectible accounts and iii a million after tax charge included in fiscal year related to a transaction with a bankrupt energy trader 
interest expense the explanations for changes in washington gas interest expense are substantially the same as the explanations included in the management s discussion of wgl holdings 
those explanations are incorporated herein by reference into this discussion

table of contents washington gas light company part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations concluded regulatory matters during fiscal year  the effect of regulatory decisions issued in fiscal years and has contributed favorably to the company s overall operating results 
a relatively higher contribution during the later half of the company s fiscal year reflects changes in rate design that are contributing proportionately more from higher fixed system charges that include certain of the fixed costs the company incurs to serve customers 
the earnings effect of regulatory decisions also reflects certain accounting adjustments necessitated by the decisions 
the regulated utility bases its requests for modifying existing rates on increased net investment in plant and equipment  higher operating expenses and the need to earn a just and reasonable return on invested capital 
from through september   the regulated utility had not modified base rates in its major jurisdictions 
commencing in fiscal year  washington gas has increased the frequency for seeking rate relief to ensure its rates reflect the underlying cost of providing utility service
