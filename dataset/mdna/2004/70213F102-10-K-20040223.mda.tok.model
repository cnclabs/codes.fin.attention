item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the financial review that follows focuses on the factors affecting the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of partners trust financial group  inc  and its subsidiary  sbu bank the bank combined  the company  during the year ended december  and the preceding two years 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with this review 
income 
our results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on loans and securities and the cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses  securities and loan sale activities  loan servicing activities  service charges and fees collected on deposit accounts  income collected from trust and investment advisory services and the income earned on bank owned life insurance 
expenses 
our expenses primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  marketing expense  technology expense  other expense and income tax expense 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities 
highlights total assets were billion at december   which was million lower than at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily caused by a million outflow of deposits  due largely to our relatively low deposit account rates 
the average balances of loans and deposits were up significantly during  however  primarily due to the acquisition of herkimer trust corporation  inc herkimer on december  net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or  higher than the same period in the increase is primarily due to the herkimer acquisition and emphasis on net interest margin and expense control 
return on assets and return on equity were and  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to and  respectively  for the same period in adoption of plan of conversion and reorganization and acquisition on december   the board of directors of the mhc  the company and the bank adopted the plan of conversion and reorganization of partners trust  mhc the plan for the conversion and restructuring of the company and the mhc into a full capital stock corporation 
the plan is subject to regulatory  depositor and stockholder approvals 
in addition  the company signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire bsb bancorp  inc bsb  the holding company for bsb bank trust company 
the acquisition will only occur if the conversion is completed 
the consideration to be paid in the merger will be cash and stock 
shareholders of bsb will be able to elect either in cash or shares of common stock of the reorganized partners trust  subject to customary proration and allocation procedures 
the aggregate value of the transaction is approximately million 
the conversion  offering and acquisition are expected to be completed in mid  subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals 
as of december   bsb had total assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and total shareholders equity of million

rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii net change 
the changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets were billion at december   which was million lower than at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily caused by a million outflow of deposits 
securities available for sale were relatively flat from december  to december   although there was a change in the mix of securities 
us treasury and obligations of us government corporations and agencies and other mortgage backed securities increased million and million  respectively  while collateralized mortgage obligations decreased million 
prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage backed securities were at a high level in as interest rates decreased and borrowers refinanced at lower rates 
these securities were primarily replaced with obligations of us government agencies and additional mortgage backed securities 
loans receivable were flat year to year 
however  due primarily to the herkimer transaction  our average outstanding loan balance increased significantly from million in to million in  and our loan mix changed 
residential mortgages increased million or and were of total loans receivable  compared to at the end of as interest rates remained at historic lows in  refinancing activity of residential mortgages was substantial 
this  in conjunction with borrowers desire for shorter term loans such as year biweekly mortgages  allowed us to retain more loans for portfolio 
commercial real estate and consumer loans decreased million  or and million  or respectively 
the decline in commercial real estate loans is primarily attributed to customers refinancing their loans with competitors who offered rates and conditions that the bank was not willing to match  and due to the planned exiting of riskier lending relationships 
the decline in consumer loans is primarily attributed to a high level of payoffs on automobile loans as consumers took advantage of extremely low rates of financing offered by automotive manufacturers 
during  our security and loan portfolios repriced downward as market rates decreased 
accordingly  we decreased the rates we paid on deposits in an effort to maintain net interest income 
deposits were often priced below the competition which caused the decrease in deposits year to year 
total deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  the decrease occurred in all deposit types  but the majority of the decrease was in time deposits which are not considered core deposits 
time deposits decreased million or from december  to december total shareholders equity increased million primarily due to net income of million  partially offset by million of dividends paid to minority shareholders and a million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or  higher than the same period in the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of herkimer trust corporation  inc herkimer on december  and emphasis on net interest margin and expense control 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the same period in the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the improvement in spread occurred as a result of acquiring generally higher yielding net earning assets from herkimer  which had more of a commercial banking nature  and because we aggressively managed our funding costs in a downward rate environment 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in  a reduction of basis points 
this reduction more than offset the basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets period to period 
our ability to further reduce rates on deposits has diminis hed 
we have priced our deposit account rates near the lowest in our marketplace  and at levels below most other local community banks 
this deposit pricing strategy may make it more difficult for us to attract and or retain deposits and has resulted in the outflow of certificates of deposit as previously discussed 
due to competitive pressure  we may be forced to increase rates on deposits which will most likely decrease our net interest margin 
although we have the ability to meet our liquidity needs through borrowings  we will seek to retain core deposits and customer relationships 
furthermore  if market rates continue to decline  or remain at their current low level  our assets will continue to reprice downward  which could also decrease our net interest margin 
we had an investment of million in federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny common stock at december  the fhlbny reported that it suspended the october dividend payment on this stock 
this announcement reduced interest income by approximately  or one quarter s dividend amount 
future earnings will be impacted to the extent the fhlbny continues the dividend suspension or reduces the dividend amount from that previously paid 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management considers necessary to absorb probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events occur 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses in order to increase the allowance 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in we used the same general methodology in determining the required loan loss provision and in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for both periods 
our primary asset quality ratios have improved from december  to december  in addition  our classified loans have decreased year to year 
based upon our analysis of the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios  and the improved credit quality  we do not expect commercial charge offs in to continue at levels 
non interest income 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest income dollars in thousands change change service fees trust and investment services income from bank owned life insurance net loss gain on sale of securities available for sale net gain on sale of loans other income total non interest income the increase in non interest income from to is primarily attributed to an increase in fee generating deposit accounts and new products offered as a result of the herkimer acquisition  as well as efforts to expand fee generating product lines such as the sale of title insurance and non deposit investment products 
with the acquisition of herkimer at the end of  we are now able to offer trust and asset management services which resulted in  in income for the year ended december  commissions on sales of non deposit investment products increased  period to period  which is primarily attributable to increased emphasis on this product line 
the increase in net gain on sale of loans is primarily attributable to  in gains on the sale of agricultural loans as we sought to exit this business line 
these loans were classified as held for sale 
other income decreased for the year ended december  primarily because the results for were positively impacted by a  legal settlement 
there was no such amount in this was partially offset by a  increase in income from the sale of title insurance  which income totaled  in non interest expense 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest expense dollars in thousands change change salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense writedown of land and buildings held for sale marketing expense professional services technology expense contribution expense amortization of intangible assets n a merger expenses other expense total non interest expense the increase in non interest expense from to is primarily due to operating as a larger  more geographically diverse company as a result of the herkimer acquisition 
in  we recognized  of expense related to restricted stock granted under our long term stock based incentive plan that was adopted in the fourth quarter of during which time   of expense was recognized 
additionally  expense of our employee stock ownership plan the esop increased  due to an increase in our stock price 
the remaining increase in salary and employee benefits is primarily due to the additional employees retained from herkimer to staff the branches acquired 
we had full time equivalent employees at december   compared to at september   the most recent quarter prior to the herkimer acquisition 
occupancy and equipment expense increased primarily due to an increase in utilities  real estate taxes  rent and maintenance expenses related to the increase in the number of branches 
we had nine branches prior to the herkimer acquisition  compared with at december  the increase in professional services is primarily attributed to an increase in item processing costs due to increased account volume and increased legal fees incurred on a variety of routine matters 
technology expense increased primarily due to an increase in computer and atm expenses  again related to the increased locations and volumes related primarily to the herkimer acquisition 
in  we recorded a one time million contribution expense in connection with establishing the sbu bank charitable foundation 
amortization of the core deposit and trust intangible assets related to herkimer was million for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded  of expense related to covenants not to compete with former herkimer employees 
all merger expenses related to the herkimer acquisition were recorded in  and there were no such expenses in other expense increased million  or 
expenses related to other real estate owned increased  primarily as a result of the  loss on the sale of a million property 
mortgage recording tax expense increased  during  which is attributed to a million increase in residential mortgage originations 
losses on our automatic overdraft program implemented in were  offsetting this increase was an increase in service fee income as previously discussed 
the remainder of the increase in other expenses is primarily due to increases in a variety of expenses primarily attributed to the effect of the herkimer acquisition 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributed to the higher net income before taxes resulting in a higher marginal tax rate 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per share computed on earnings from the date of the reorganization  which was million higher than the results were substantially affected by the bank s reorganization and merger expenses 
in connection with the reorganization  we contributed  shares of newly issued stock and  in cash to the sbu bank charitable foundation  resulting in a one time charitable contribution expense of million  or approximately million after income taxes 
we also incurred million in merger expenses related to herkimer  or approximately million after income taxes 
the increase in net income from the prior year was primarily due to higher net interest income and a reduction in the provision for loan losses  partially offset by a decrease in non interest income  an increase in non interest expense and an increase in income tax expense 
return on average assets for the yea rs ended december  and was and  respectively 
return on average equity for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the improvement in spread occurred as we aggressively managed its funding costs in a downward rate environment beginning in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for  a reduction of basis points 
this reduction more than offset the basis point reduction in the weighted average yield on earning assets year to year 
the improvement in the net interest margin resulted from the increase in spread and an increase in the ratio of average earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities 
this ratio was for the y ear ended december  compared with for the increase occurred primarily as the growth in our equity  primarily from the ipo  was invested in earning assets 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses is due to the improvement in our asset quality ratios 
non performing loans to total loans decreased to from at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and to total loans increased to and  respectively  from and  respectively  at december  and  respectively 
we used the same general methodology in determining the allowance at both dates and the provision for both periods 
non interest income 
non interest income is comprised primarily of fee income derived from bank services and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
non interest income decreased  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to a  gain related to a life insurance policy on a deceased employee recognized in there was no such transaction in the decrease was partially offset by a  increase in net gain on sale of loans  caused by an increase in the volume of loans sold 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is primarily due to the contribution of stock and cash to the sbu bank charitable foundation resulting in an expense of million  merger expenses of million primarily consisting of systems conversion costs  customer communication  personnel charges  and writedowns on company properties that are no longer being used  esop expense of  and  of expense related to our management recognition plan 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in impairment writedowns on land and buildings held for sale 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the gain on the life insurance policy discussed under non interest income was non taxable  resulting in a lower effective tax rate in the year ended december  compared to impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of our operations 
unlike those of most industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
for the year ended december   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise during the ordinary course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  maturities and calls of securities and funds provided by our operations 
in addition  we may enter into repurchase agreements with approved broker dealers and we may borrow from the federal home loan bank of new york 
at december  we had million in outstanding borrowings 
our primary investing activities are the origination of loans  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of securities 
for the years ended december  and  loan originations totaled million and million  respectively 
purchases of securities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had loan commitments to borrowers of approximately million  and letters of credit of approximately million 
total deposits decreased million during the year ended december  as discussed previously 
total deposits increased million during the year ended december   primarily due to the herkimer acquisition 
deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors and other factors 
time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were million at december  based on our deposit retention experience we anticipate that a majority of these time deposits will be retained  though our current deposit pricing strategy has resulted in increased outflows  which may continue 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position and monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis 
if deposit outflow increases beyond reasonable levels  we will rea djust our deposit pricing strategy or take other measures  such as not reinvesting security payments or increasing borrowings  to ensure ample liquidity 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  nor do we have any balloon or other payments due on any long term obligations  although a million of fhlb advance at december  can be called by the fhlb at quarterly intervals 
if called  we have the option to reprice the advance at the then current fhlb rates  or to repay the advance 
the advance has a rate of and matures in august given the current interest rate levels  we do not anticipate that this advance will be called in the near term 
on an unconsolidated basis at the holding company level  our primary sources of funds are net proceeds from capital offerings  dividends from the bank  and investment income 
the main use of liquidity is the payment of dividends to common stockholders 
at december   we had million of cash and securities available for sale at the holding company level on an unconsolidated basis 
because of the substantial level of cash at the company  the bank has not paid dividends to the company 
under ots capital distribution regulations  the bank may pay dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval so long as the bank meets its applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after payment of the dividends and its total dividends do not exceed its net income to date over the calendar year plus retained net income over the preceding two years 
the ots has discretion to prohibit any otherwise permissible capital distributions on general safety and soundness grounds  a nd must be given days advance notice of all capital distributions 
at december   the bank had the ability to pay dividends of million to the company without the prior approval of the ots 
at december   both the bank and sbu municipal bank exceeded all the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
although the office of thrift supervision does not impose minimum capital requirements on thrift holding companies  our consolidated regulatory capital amounts and ratios are discussed below 
the company s consolidated and the bank s leverage tier capital at december  was million and million  respectively  or and of assets  respectively 
in order to be classified as well capitalized under federal banking regulations  the bank was required to have leverage tier capital of at least million  or of assets 
to be classified as a well capitalized bank  the bank must also have a ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
management also considers the accounting policy relating to the test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the results of operations 
our policies on the allowance for loan losses and goodwill and intangible assets are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section in part  item of this report 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reader to revi ew each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative analysi s 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more rapidly than interest earning assets 
the primary objective of our interest rate risk policy is to manage the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
we actively monitor interest rate risk in connection with our lending  investing  deposit and borrowing activities 
quantitative analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model  which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current conditions 
the following table sets forth the result of our net interest income simulation model as of december  change in interest rates in annual net interest income basis points rate shock amount change change dollars in thousands flat the above table indicates that as of december  we had a relatively well matched interest rate risk profile 
in the event of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or  decrease in net interest income 
in the event of an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or  decrease in net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future lo an prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity 
moreover  the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net interest income table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
