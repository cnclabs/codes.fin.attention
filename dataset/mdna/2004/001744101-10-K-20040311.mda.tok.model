certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements below 
overview we are a leading temporary healthcare staffing company and the largest nationwide provider of travel nurse staffing services 
we recruit nurses and allied health professionals  our temporary healthcare professionals  nationally and internationally and place them on temporary assignments of variable lengths at acute care hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the united states 
for the year ended december   we recorded revenue of million  as compared to revenue of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment averaged   and  in  and  respectively 
we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million and a net loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue and net income since is indicative of our expansion of our existing brands  improvements in contract terms with our hospital and healthcare facility clients  and our acquisitions of healthcare resource management corporation  hrmc  in april and o grady peyton international usa  inc  ogp  in may during  however  we experienced changes in hospital staffing patterns  which led to a reduction in temporary healthcare professionals on assignment  revenue and net income 
see additional discussion in results of operations below 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees paid directly by hospitals and healthcare facilities rather than from payments by government or other third parties 
we enter into two types of contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients flat rate contracts and payroll contracts 
under a flat rate contract  the temporary healthcare professional becomes an employee of the hospital or healthcare facility and is placed on their payroll 
we bill the hospital or healthcare facility a flat weekly rate to compensate us for providing recruitment  housing and travel services 
alternatively  under a payroll contract  the temporary healthcare professional is our employee 
we then bill our hospital or healthcare facility client at an hourly rate to compensate us for the temporary healthcare professional s wages and benefits  as well as for recruitment  housing and travel services 
our clients generally prefer payroll contracts because this arrangement eliminates significant employee and payroll administrative burdens for them 
temporary healthcare professional wages and benefits billed under a payroll contract effectively represent a pass through cost component for us and we are compensated by our clients for our value added services 
while payroll contracts generate more gross profit than flat rate contracts  the gross margin generated is lower due to the pass through of the temporary healthcare professional s compensation costs 
over the past five years  we  and the industry as a whole  have migrated towards a greater utilization of payroll contracts 
during  approximately of our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients were payroll contracts 
since we have completed five strategic acquisitions 
we acquired medical express  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the pacific northwest and mountain states 
during  we completed the acquisitions of nursesrx  inc in june and preferred healthcare staffing  inc in november  which strengthened our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
we completed our acquisition of ogp in may  the leading recruiter of registered nurses from english speaking foreign countries for placement in the united states 
we completed our fifth acquisition in april  acquiring hrmc  to add to our presence in the eastern and southern regions of the united states 
each of these acquisitions has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
therefore  the operating results of the acquired 
table of contents entities are included in our results of operations commencing on the date of acquisition of each entity 
as a result  our results of operations following each acquisition may not be comparable with our prior results 
at the completion of our initial public offering in november  options to purchase  shares of our common stock that we previously granted to members of our management immediately vested 
these options had an average exercise price of  which was below the initial public offering price of per share 
as a result  we recorded approximately million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the fourth quarter of  of which million was related to these options 
in addition  we also recorded million of non cash stock based compensation expense in the first three quarters of and million for we also retired all of our indebtedness approximately million with the proceeds from and upon the completion of our initial public offering 
the retirement of debt resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million  which was related to the write off of the unamortized discount on our senior subordinated notes and unamortized deferred financing costs and loan fees 
on october   we completed a tender offer for an aggregate of million  or approximately million shares of our common stock and certain employee stock options 
in connection with the tender offer  we amended our current credit facility 
the amended credit facility provides for  among other things  a million secured revolving facility  letter of credit sub facility and swing line facility and a new million secured term loan facility maturing in october the tender offer was financed with a new million term loan under our amended credit facility  million of borrowings from our amended revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand 
we also incurred approximately million in transaction costs associated with the tender offer and the amendment of the credit facility  which were funded with cash on hand 
recent trends from through  the temporary healthcare staffing industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately  and this growth accelerated to a compound annual growth rate of approximately from to over the last year  the demand for temporary healthcare professionals has declined due to a number of factors 
in particular  we believe hospitals have increased their nurse recruitment efforts  stretched the productivity of permanent staff and maximized the cost effectiveness of outsourced staffing solutions 
in addition  because of the recent economic conditions  we believe permanent staff at our hospital and healthcare facility clients have been more likely to work overtime and less likely to leave their positions  creating fewer vacancies and fewer opportunities for us to place our temporary healthcare professionals 
the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment for the year decreased from an average of  in to an average of  in additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we had an average of  temporary healthcare professionals on assignment 
as a result of this decline  revenue and net income decreased throughout demand for our services stabilized from april through october  and has increased since then  throughout many regions 
we believe that this increase in the number of orders placed by our hospital and healthcare facility clients is a result of increased hospital admissions growth and legislation impacting healthcare staffing throughout the united states  such as the california nurse staffing ratios that went into effect in january in addition  we believe signs of an improving economy and our increased focus on our hospital and healthcare facility clients have driven the recent increase in demand 
we believe we will continue to experience a lag between when changes in demand occur and when our operations processes translate into changes in the number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and our financial results 
therefore  the changes in demand experienced in our industry could also result in continued changes in revenue and net income in subsequent quarters  and it is uncertain whether the recent increase in demand will drive increases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment 
critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial 
table of contents statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for self insurance and compensation and related benefits  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill resulting from our past acquisitions 
through december   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over useful lives of years 
commencing with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and have performed annual impairment analyses to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
upon our annual impairment analysis on december  and december   we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
as of december   we had million of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  recorded on our balance sheet 
we maintain an accrual for our self insured health benefits provided to our temporary healthcare professionals  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of this accrual by evaluating our historical experience and trends related to both health insurance claims and payments  information provided to us by our insurance broker and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
as of december  we had million accrued for incurred but not reported health insurance claims 
historically  our accrual for health insurance has been adequate to provide for incurred claims  and has fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and increases in national healthcare costs 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating our historical annual write offs in relation to revenue  as well as evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the financial condition of customers  delinquency trends  credit histories of customers and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we maintain an accrual for professional liability and workers compensation self insured retention limits 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by evaluating our historical experience and trends  as well as through the use of independent actuarial studies 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
as of december   we had million accrued for workers compensation claims  which is included in accrued compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december  we had million accrued for professional liability retention which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include payroll and employee related matters and investigations by governmental agencies 
table of contents regarding our employment practices 
as we become aware of such claims and legal actions  we provide accruals if the exposures are probable and estimable 
we may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations  and legal actions relating to services provided by our professionals  and we maintain accruals for these matters 
we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us

table of contents liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary liquidity requirements have been for acquisitions  working capital requirements and debt service under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under our existing credit facility
