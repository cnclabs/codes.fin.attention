recent accounting pronouncements 
risks and uncertainties executive overview was a challenging year for the company 
we experienced declines in year over year net sales and net income for the first time in company history 
we attribute these results primarily to increased competition and higher advertising costs  which adversely impacted sales of our bowflex products 
after years of uninterrupted growth  unit sales of bowflex products through the direct sales channel declined in from an all time high in the company responded with a turnaround plan focused on repositioning our products to better meet customer demand and shopping patterns  leveraging our multiple sales channels by cross selling products and offering complete packages of cardiovascular and strength products  and innovation in providing our customers with new differentiated products at a more rapid pace 
in  two notable examples of executing on our strategic initiatives were the introduction of the bowflex line of strength equipment to the retail sales channel and the launch of the revolutionary treadclimber line of cardiovascular equipment through the direct sales channel 
heading into  we are encouraged by some trends that we intend to build upon going forward including increased net sales and earnings for our commercial retail business segment  greater diversification of our net sales and earnings with new product introductions such as the treadclimber  and sequential growth in quarterly bowflex units sold beginning in the third quarter of for the first time since the second quarter of we are also presented with some challenges heading into our bowflex power pro model was the subject of a voluntary product safety reinforcement program in cooperation with the consumer product safety commission the cpsc that was formally announced in january in addition  we expect an increase in competition with our bowflex product line as the patent on the power rod resistance technology expires in april 
table of contents in summary  we had a difficult year in  and will also present a number of challenges  but we are encouraged about our progress to date on our turnaround plan and our long term potential 
the turnaround plan we embarked upon in the middle of is a rigorous undertaking  but we believe that the brand and channel segmentation work we initiated will create the leading health and fitness company and deliver long term value for our shareholders 
in and beyond we plan to capture a significantly greater share of the cardiovascular fitness equipment market  which our market research shows makes up approximately of the consumer dollars spent on fitness equipment through the retail channel  continue to diversify our product line by leveraging our research and development capabilities to launch new innovative products that consumers demand  leverage our sales channels and sell more products through our retail channels to diversify our portfolio and sell products where consumers shop 
in addition  we will continue to pursue new sales channels  such as the strategic relationship we began with amazon 
com  inc in the latter half of  and continue to improve operating efficiencies and cash flow by streamlining operations and maximizing business synergies  such as brand equity  sales channels and marketing resources 
we are excited about the company s prospects as we continue to build on our solid foundation with a blueprint based on financial rigor  innovation and trust 
through careful planning and consistent execution  we expect to deliver both sales and earnings growth over the long term 
we believe we have the infrastructure  balance sheet and management team to support this growth 
over the next nine to twelve months  we intend to continue laying the foundation for clear and sustainable progress  and we expect to show measurable results from these efforts in the latter part of and beyond 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and 
table of contents collectibility is reasonably assured or probable 
revenue is recognized net of applicable promotional discounts  rebates  and return allowances 
for all of our products  except nautilus commercial equipment  revenue from product sales is recognized when title and risk of loss have passed 
revenue is recognized upon installation for the nautilus commercial equipment if we are responsible for installation 
return allowances  which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
in addition  from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our equipment 
in the event that a guarantee of the commercial customer s lease obligation is made  we record a liability and corresponding reduction of revenue for the estimated fair value of the guarantee and then recognize revenue over the life of the lease obligation 
stock based compensation we measure compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the method prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
a change to recognize compensation expense for all options granted using a fair value approach in regularly reported financial results would have a significant impact on our results of operations 
warranty reserves the product warranty reserve includes the cost to manufacture raw materials  labor and overhead or purchase warranty parts from our suppliers as well as the cost to ship those parts to our customers 
the cost of labor to install a warranted part on our manufactured commercial equipment is also included 
the warranty reserve is based on our historical experience with each product 
a warranty reserve is established for new products based on historical experience with similar products  adjusted for any technological advances in manufacturing or materials used 
we track warranty claims by part and reason for claim in order to identify any potential warranty trends 
the warranty trends are evaluated periodically with respect to future volume and nature of likely claims 
adjustments  if any are so indicated  are made to the warranty reserve to reflect our judgment regarding the likely effect of the warranty trends on future claims 
if we were to experience a significant volume of warranty claims for a particular part or for a particular reason  we may need to make design changes to our product 
a change in warranty experience could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
product safety reinforcement recall program reserve the reserve for the product safety reinforcement recall program includes the cost of the reinforcement kits  the third party call center costs to process customer requests for the kit  and costs to mail the kit to our customers 
the reserve is calculated based on historical customer response rates for similar issues faced by other companies  as noted by the consumer product safety commission the cpsc 
although our estimates are based on historical information  there remains a great deal of uncertainty due to the unique circumstances surrounding each company and product 
if actual customer response rates vary from existing estimates  adjustments will be made to the reserve to reflect any changes in our judgment regarding ultimate customer response results 
a change in program response rate from our estimates could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents legal reserves we are involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings from time to time 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we accrue and charge to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  they are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
sales return reserves the sales return reserve is maintained based on our historical experience of direct marketed product return rates during the period in which a customer can return a product for refund of the full purchase price  less shipping and handling in most instances 
the return periods for bowflex  treadclimber  champion nutrition  and nautilus sleep systems product lines are six weeks  days  days  and days  respectively 
sales returns are insignificant for products sold through our commercial retail distribution channels 
we track all direct marketed product returns in order to identify any potential negative customer satisfaction trends 
our return reserve may be sensitive to a change in our customers ability to pay during the trial period due to unforeseen economic circumstances and to different product introductions that might fulfill the customers needs at a perceived better value 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may increase sales returns  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level based on our historical experience adjusted for any known uncollectible amounts 
we periodically review the creditworthiness of our customers to help gauge collectibility 
our allowance is sensitive to changes in our customers ability to pay due to unforeseen changes in the economy  including the bankruptcy of a major customer  our efforts to actively pursue collections  and increases in chargebacks 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is valued at the lower of cost standard or average depending on location or market 
inventory adjustments are applied for any known obsolete or defective products 
we periodically review inventory levels of our product lines in conjunction with market trends to assess salability of our products 
our assessment of necessary adjustments to market value of inventory is sensitive to changes in fitness technology and competitor product offerings driven by customer demand 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in reductions to market value of inventory below cost  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents intangible asset valuation currently  intangible assets consist predominantly of the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks and goodwill associated with the acquisition of schwinn fitness 
management estimates affecting these trademark and goodwill valuations include determination of useful lives and estimates of future cash flows and fair values to perform an impairment analysis on an annual basis 
the useful lives assigned by management to the nautilus  schwinn  and stairmaster trademarks and schwinn fitness goodwill are indefinite  years  indefinite  and indefinite  respectively 
any major change in the useful lives and or the determination of an impairment associated with the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets may result in asset value write downs  which could have a significant impact on our current and future financial position and results of operations 
income tax provision the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
to the extent the audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in income tax expense benefit in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the event 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
no valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets  since we anticipate the full amount of these assets should be realized in the future 
accordingly  if the company s facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that operate in evolving markets 
we may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties and  consequently  we cannot assure you of any future growth or profitability

table of contents the following tables present certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales and statement of operations data comparing results for   and statement of operations data year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative royalties total operating expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income statement of operations data year ended december  in thousands change change change change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative royalties total operating expenses operating income other income net income before income taxes income tax expense net income 
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  net sales net sales decreased by in compared to we experienced a challenging business environment in we believe this was primarily due to increased competition and higher advertising costs due to increased demand for advertising time 
these factors reduced sales conversion rates for our direct marketed products 
sales within our direct segment were million in  a decrease of compared with our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  down from in within our direct segment  bowflex sales accounted for of sales in compared to of sales in the decrease in direct segment sales can be attributed to a combination of factors including increased competition for our bowflex product line and managing our advertising spending in a higher advertising cost environment to optimize profitability 
we believe competing products have adversely affected demand for our bowflex products as unit sales through the direct channel declined to  in from  in  a decline of 
additionally  advertising costs have risen when comparing to  resulting in lower sales of direct marketed products for comparable advertising spending 
as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expense for the direct segment was in compared to in in july of  we introduced the bowflex xtreme to compete more effectively with our lower priced competition 
the average bowflex selling price increased year over year  but declined in comparing the fourth quarter of to the same period in we anticipate the introduction of lower priced competing products to increase going forward  especially upon expiration of the main bowflex patent in april during the second quarter of  we began a process of reassessing the marketing plan for our nautilus sleep systems product line 
this has involved a reduction in the amount of advertising spending for this product line  which has also resulted in a reduction in sales compared with we are repositioning the nautilus sleep system by improving the features of this brand and exploring unique  specialized channels of distribution 
our repositioning effort will not be complete on this product until the latter half of  and at that time we expect to re launch the nautilus sleep systems 
our new treadclimber product line  introduced in march  has exceeded our expectations having achieved million in sales for the year 
these sales were achieved despite our plan of restrained demand 
when we introduced the treadclimber  we wanted to ensure that our manufacturing  marketing and operations were all performing in unison before we expanded our marketing efforts 
we are excited about the potential this newly created brand will offer for years to come 
the treadclimber represents a significant milestone as we attempt to further diversify our revenue and earnings streams 
we expect treadclimber sales to be a significant portion of our non bowflex revenue  which increased to of consolidated net sales in compared to and in and  respectively 
in we believe the treadclimber product line will generate approximately to million in revenue 
sales within our commercial retail segment were million in  an increase of over excluding our acquisition of stairmaster  commercial retail segment sales increased during compared to the increase in sales within the commercial retail segment is primarily attributable to the introduction of the bowflex to the retail side of the business  which equated to sales of million 
bowflex sales accounted for of overall commercial retail segment sales and of the increase in commercial retail sales during due to encouraging results from our initial test marketing plan that began in the first quarter of  we expanded the retail distribution of bowflex products throughout the remainder of we were able to leverage the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on television advertising of the bowflex product line to create consumer demand in the retail sales channel where many consumers prefer buying premium fitness products 
in the future  we anticipate more of our direct segment products being sold through the commercial retail sales channel in order to leverage our significant direct marketing advertising investment 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  bowflex unit sales through our direct and retail channels combined were  units compared to  and  for the third and second quarters of  respectively 
one of the reasons we were able to achieve this sequential growth in bowflex units is because of the synergy between the direct and retail channels 
additionally  we believe the sales momentum for our bowflex brand is due to the fact that it is widely regarded by consumers as one of the most innovative products in the consumer strength fitness industry 
to capitalize on this reputation  we will have bowflex products in multiple sales channels that will be differentiated to fit the needs of consumers shopping those channels 
for example  we will not sell in large retail outlets the same bowflex product we sell in specialty retail or in the direct sales channel 
this strategy will allow us and our retail partners to have differentiated products under the same brand name so we minimize competition amongst ourselves and our partners  while at the same time delivering the products our consumers want in the sales channel in which they want to shop 
besides the bowflex  our commercial retail segment product portfolio consists of a wide array of both strength and cardiovascular fitness products sold through the commercial and retail channels under brand names that include nautilus  schwinn  stairmaster  and trimline 
in  our commercial retail segment accounted for of our net sales  up from in  as we continued to execute our strategy of expanding our presence  product lines  and brands across all our sales channels  especially within the commercial retail segment 
this increase in commercial retail segment sales as a percentage of our total net sales can also be attributed to the decline in direct segment sales during compared to during  our commercial retail business segment sales increased  excluding the introduction of the bowflex product line to the retail sales channel 
in our commercial business we launched a new stairmaster commercial treadmill in the latter half of we also introduced a number of new products at the october club industry commercial fitness equipment show in chicago 
one of the products presented was our new stairmaster commercial elliptical machine 
we also introduced the new nautilus nitro plus commercial strength equipment line 
we began production on this new strength line at the end of the fourth quarter of and we expect to begin selling this product in the first quarter of later in  we plan to launch the first variable stride elliptical commercial cardio machine and a commercial version of the popular treadclimber cardio product 
we continue to become more competitive in our commercial sales channel because of our ability to offer a complete line of cardiovascular equipment  which represents about of the dollars spent in the commercial industry 
in the past this has been an underrepresented area of our product offering 
however  with the addition of our new commercial elliptical and commercial treadmills  we are now beginning to address this underserved market opportunity 
we are now able to sell complete packages of cardiovascular and strength products together 
we have been undergoing a sales channel and brand shift from primarily the direct channel to a more diversified and balanced penetration in retail  commercial and direct channels 
we have also created a better balance between cardiovascular and strength products 
in the past  we have been primarily focused on selling strength products through our direct channel  but a thorough marketing research study undertaken in showed that of our target consumer market buys fitness products through the retail channel and of the dollars are spent on cardiovascular products 
we expect our sales through the commercial retail channel to continue to grow as a percentage of consolidated sales as we continue to focus our marketing efforts and product offerings toward our target consumer 
we believe our business will show increased seasonality going forward as we anticipate sales through the commercial retail channels will continue to grow as a percentage of total sales 
in our direct marketing 
table of contents business we have found that second quarter influences on television viewership  such as the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather factors  cause our spot television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
our retail business is also highly seasonal 
we believe that sales within our commercial retail segment are considerably lower in the second quarter of the year compared to the other quarters 
our strongest quarter for the commercial retail segment is generally the fourth quarter  followed by the first and third quarters 
we believe the principal reason for this trend is the commercial retail fitness industry s preparation for the impact of new year s fitness resolutions and seasonal weather patterns related to colder winter months 
as we continue to move to a more diversified revenue stream  we expect to experience overall seasonality similar to the retail and commercial sales channels 
we believe our revenue and earnings will be lower in the first half of compared to the latter half of the year  with the second quarter experiencing the most softness 
in the first six months of  our commercial and retail sales channels generated approximately of its full year revenue and of its full year net income 
gross profit gross profits decreased in compared to as sales of inherently lower margin products in the commercial retail segment continued to grow as a percentage of total sales  our overall gross profit margin decreased to in  compared to in the gross profit margin within our direct segment was in compared to in direct segment margin was significantly impacted by million of estimated product safety reinforcement costs associated with the bowflex power pro that was announced by our company and the cpsc in january in addition  direct segment gross profit margin was negatively impacted by declining sales resulting in higher fixed costs per sale and a change in sales mix from the higher margin bowflex to the treadclimber 
as we continue to sell more units of the treadclimber we believe our treadclimber margins will increase due to the leveraging of our fixed costs 
the increase in gross profit margin within our commercial retail segment to in  compared with in  was primarily due to sales of bowflex products through the retail channel 
on average  bowflex products have a higher gross profit margin than do our other commercial retail products 
operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased in compared to as a percentage of net sales  overall selling and marketing expenses increased to in from in selling and marketing expenses within our direct segment were of net sales in  compared to in selling and marketing expenses within our commercial retail segment were of net sales in  compared to in the overall increase in selling and marketing is mainly due to reduced effectiveness of our direct advertising campaigns  partially offset by leveraging the direct channel advertising investment in the retail channel 
we experienced an increase in direct marketing advertising spending during in response to declines in our sales conversion rates coupled with a higher advertising cost environment 
we believe the decline in conversion was a result of increased competition 
in addition  depreciation associated with our newly implemented customer relationship management information system also contributed to the increase in selling and marketing costs 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in compared to our direct segment accounted for million of the million increase due primarily to depreciation  consulting costs  and wages associated with our newly implemented computer information systems 
our commercial retail segment general and administrative expenses declined by million due mostly to cost savings associated with the integration of the schwinn fitness and stairmaster businesses that we acquired in september and february  respectively 
our financial statements now reflect a third segment comprised of our corporate holding company which includes primarily general and administrative expenses such as investor relations  director costs  legal and accounting fees  and salaries of corporate personnel  as well as other costs not specifically attributable to our other two segments 
for financial reporting purposes  we have reclassified prior year balances to conform to this three segment presentation with no effect on previously reported consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million due primarily to additional legal related expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in royalties royalty expense decreased in from our direct and commercial retail segments have several agreements under which we are obligated to pay royalty fees on certain products 
the decrease in our royalty expense is primarily attributable to the decreased sales of our bowflex products 
this decrease in bowflex related royalties was partially offset by royalty expense associated with our treadclimber product sales 
the patent for the bowflex power rod resistance technology expires april   at which time we will no longer be obligated to pay royalties related to bowflex sales 
we are obligated to pay royalties of treadclimber sales to the inventor of the main patent on the treadclimber until this patent expires on december  income tax expense income tax expense decreased in due to the decline in our income before taxes 
we expect our income tax expense to fluctuate in line with changes in our income before taxes 
net income for the reasons discussed above  net income declined to million in from million in  a decrease of 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  net sales net sales increased by to million in from million in excluding our acquisitions of schwinn fitness and stairmaster  sales grew by approximately on a consolidated basis in compared to the increase in sales was driven by the growth in our direct segment and continued expansion of our commercial retail business 
sales within our direct segment were million in  an increase of over a significant reason for the increase in direct segment sales can be attributed to the introduction of our high end bowflex ultimate at the end of the fourth quarter of the ultimate was well received by consumers leading to sequential growth in the average selling price of our bowflex product line in each quarter from its introduction in through 
table of contents our direct segment accounted for of our aggregate net sales in  down from in  as we continued our strategies of diversification into the commercial and retail markets and of introducing new direct marketed products 
sales within our commercial retail segment were million in  an increase of over a significant portion of this growth is attributed to the acquisition of schwinn fitness in september and stairmaster in february our commercial retail segment accounted for of our net sales in  up from in as we continued to execute our strategy of expanding our presence  product lines  and brands across all our channels  especially within the commercial retail segment 
gross profit gross profits continued to be strong  growing to million in from million in however  due to our product diversification strategy  which increased sales of inherently lower margin products in the commercial retail segment  our overall gross profit margin decreased to in  compared to in the gross profit margin within our direct segment was in and in gross margins on our bowflex product line continued to be strong due to cost reductions from vendors and shipping cost savings 
for example  the standard cost for the bowflex power pro with a pound rod pack was reduced approximately by the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in in addition  product delivery costs were reduced by approximately by the end of the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in the decrease in gross profit margin within our commercial retail segment to in  compared with in  was largely due to the schwinn fitness and stairmaster acquisitions 
other downward pressure on commercial retail margins included discounts offered on sales of discontinued retail products and manufacturing inefficiencies associated with moves and the consolidation of our treadmill facilities 
discounts were offered to reduce inventory levels of older products in order to accommodate new retail fitness products that were introduced during the third quarter 
operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase in selling and marketing expenses resulted primarily from the expansion of our direct marketing campaign for bowflex products and nautilus sleep systems  higher advertising costs in the second half of due to increased demand for advertising time  and the acquisitions of schwinn fitness and stairmaster 
advertising costs for our direct marketing segment rose for the first time in about two years 
as a percentage of net sales  overall selling and marketing expenses decreased to in from in the decrease was primarily a result of executing our product diversification strategy leading to a higher proportion of commercial retail segment sales 
selling and marketing expenses within our direct segment were of net sales in  compared to in 
table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses grew to million in from million in  an increase of million  or 
our commercial retail segment accounted for million of the increase due primarily to our schwinn fitness and stairmaster acquisitions 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to increased staffing and infrastructure expenses necessary to support our growth 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased marginally to in from in royalties royalty expense grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in our royalty expenses was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our bowflex products  along with sales of other products under royalty agreements that were added as part of our diversification strategy 
other income in  other income was million compared to million for this decline resulted primarily from a decrease in interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents 
because we used a significant portion of our cash for acquisitions and stock buybacks  we had less cash from which to derive interest income 
interest income also decreased due to interest rate cuts by the federal reserve bank in income tax expense income tax expense increased by million in primarily due to our increase in income before taxes 
net income for the reasons discussed above  net income grew to million in from million in  an increase of 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the quarters in the periods ended december  and the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read together with our audited financial statements and the related notes 
certain amounts from previous periods have been reclassified to conform to the full year presentation with no effect on previously reported consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results of any future period 
due to recent acquisitions within our commercial retail segment  we expect heightened seasonality in our business 
we expect sales in the second quarter to be weakest while the first and fourth quarters should be our strongest 
we expect the fourth quarter will generally be stronger than the first quarter 

table of contents quarter ended in thousands except per share march june september december total fiscal net sales gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic diluted fiscal net sales gross profit operating income net income earnings per share basic diluted liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our business primarily from cash generated by our operating activities 
during  our operating activities generated million in net cash  which contributed to an aggregate million balance in cash and cash equivalents  compared with million in net cash generated by our operating activities in net cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with net cash used in investing activities in of million 
the largest component of this change was due to the acquisition cost of stairmaster in february of of million  net of cash acquired 
additionally  we used million during for capital expenditures primarily consisting of manufacturing equipment and information systems and related equipment compared to million in capital expenditures in were historically high due to substantial investments in computer systems million and buildings million that were not required in offsetting the increase were proceeds from maturities of short term investments  which were million in versus million in net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in the primary difference between the years was million of dividends were paid in  while million was used in for stock repurchases compared to million in working capital was million at december  compared to million at december   largely due to increased cash and cash equivalents as a result of net income for the period 
the million increase in trade receivables can primarily be attributed to the million increase in sales through our commercial retail segment in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the million decrease in inventories can primarily be attributed to better alignment of inventory levels with sales volume 
the million decrease in trade payables is primarily due to the timing of inventory purchases and payments for those purchases 
the million increase in accrued liabilities can mostly be attributed to warranty  compensation and legal related expenses 

table of contents we maintain a million line of credit with a lending institution 
the line of credit is secured by certain assets and contains several financial covenants 
as of the date of this filing  we are in compliance with the covenants applicable to the line of credit  and there is no outstanding balance under the line 
we believe our existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as defined in item a of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of as of december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments are excluded from this table because they require imprecise measurement or are of a contingent nature eg off balance sheet arrangements described below 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources with third parties to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our equipment 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guaranty or other recourse provisions 
the purpose of these guaranties is to increase our selling opportunities to commercial customers that would not otherwise be able to obtain financing to purchase our equipment 
at december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting treatment for these arrangements 
we expect an increase in these types of arrangements going forward 
inflation and price changes although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had  or is likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  increases in inflation over historical levels or uncertainty in the general economy could decrease discretionary consumer spending for products like ours 
very little of our revenue variation from prior periods is attributable to price changes 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
the company adopted this statement as of january  the company believes this event is not material enough to warrant further disclosure and  therefore  continues to conclude that the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no

has not had a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december 
fin no 
addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of a variable interest entity

fin no

fin no 
consolidation requirements are effective for all variable interest entities created after january   and to pre existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  certain disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after january  the adoption of fin no 
has no effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
risks and uncertainties while management is optimistic about the company s long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our long term outlook 
competition could increase significantly upon the expiration of the principal us patent on our bowflex power rod resistance technology on april  our bowflex trademark is protected as long as we continuously use the trademark 
however  the main us patent on our bowflex power rod resistance technology  a key component of our bowflex products  expires on april  this impending patent expiration is expected to trigger the introduction of similar products by competitors and could result in a significant decline in our net sales 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position 
protecting our intellectual property is an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have several patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 

table of contents a significant decline in availability of media time or a marked increase in advertising rates may hinder our ability to effectively market our products and may reduce profitability 
we depend primarily on second spot television commercials and minute television infomercials to market and sell our direct marketed products 
consequently  a marked increase in the price we must pay for our preferred media time or a reduction in its availability may adversely impact our financial performance 
government regulatory actions could disrupt our marketing efforts and product sales 
various federal  state and local government authorities  including the federal trade commission and the cpsc  regulate our marketing efforts and products 
our sales and profitability could be significantly harmed if any of these authorities commence a regulatory enforcement action that interrupts our marketing efforts  results in a product recall or negative publicity  or requires changes in product design 
as further discussed in item  legal proceedings  the company  in cooperation with the cpsc  has implemented a safety reinforcement program for bowflex power pro exercise machines equipped with a lat tower attachment 
although we have reserved for estimated costs associated with the reinforcement program  actual consumer response could exceed our expectations  which could significantly impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
also  the cpsc is investigating whether the company violated the reporting obligations of the consumer product safety act 
as detailed in item  legal proceedings  penalties are possible in connection with this investigation 
new product development is an essential component of our strategy  an inability to successfully develop new products could negatively impact our future profitability 
our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire the rights to  and then effectively market and sell  new products that create and respond to new and evolving consumer demands 
accordingly  our net sales and profitability may be harmed if we are unable to develop  or acquire the rights to  new and different products that satisfy our marketing criteria 
in addition  any new products that we market may not generate sufficient net sales or profits to recoup their development or acquisition costs 
we also may not be able to successfully acquire intellectual property rights or potentially prevent others from claiming that we have violated their proprietary rights when we launch new products 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against such claims  even if they are without basis  and we could become subject to judgments requiring us to pay substantial damages 
if we are unable to effectively integrate future acquired businesses into our operations  we may not achieve anticipated revenue  earnings and business synergies 
as we have done in the past  we may seek to acquire other businesses in the future 
integrating acquired businesses into our operations poses significant challenges  particularly with respect to corporate cultures and management teams 
failure to successfully effect the integration could adversely impact the revenue  earnings and business synergies we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  the process of integrating acquired businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  our core business 

table of contents our future integration efforts may be jeopardized  and our actual return on investment from such acquisitions may be lower than anticipated  as a result of various factors  including the following challenges in the successful integration of the products  services or personnel of the acquired business into our operations  loss of employees or customers that are key to the acquired business  time and money spent by our management team focusing on the integration  which could distract it from our core operations  our potential lack of experience in markets of the acquired businesses  possible inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the combined companies and the need to implement our financial  accounting  information and other systems  and the need to coordinate geographically diverse operations 
a significant decline in consumer interest in bowflex products would sharply diminish our sales and profitability 
our financial performance depends significantly on sales of our bowflex line of home fitness equipment 
during  approximately of our net sales were attributable to our bowflex products 
accordingly  any significant decline in consumer interest in our bowflex products could significantly reduce our sales and profitability 
sales of our bowflex line could significantly decline if  for example  existing competing products experienced increased consumer demand  new competing products were effectively marketed and resulted in significant consumer purchases  or if the market for our bowflex line becomes saturated 
although we have significantly diversified our revenue base over the past several years  we anticipate that sales of our bowflex product line will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
a deterioration in product quality or increase in product liability could adversely affect our business 
we rely on third party manufacturers for a significant portion of our product components  and we may not be able to consistently control the quality of such components 
any material increase in the quantity of products returned by our customers for purchase price refunds could adversely affect revenues 
in addition  we are subject to potential product liability claims if our products injure  or allegedly injure  our customers or other users 
our financial performance could be affected if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover warranty claims on our products 
we could become liable for significant monetary damages if our product liability insurance coverage and reserves fail to cover future product liability claims 
unfavorable economic conditions or geopolitical upheaval could cause a decline in consumer spending and hinder our product sales 
the success of each of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to consumers and their purchasing preferences 
economic and political uncertainties could adversely impact the us and international economic environment 
a decline in economic conditions could further depress consumer spending  especially discretionary spending for premium priced products like ours 
these poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial decreases in our net sales 
we depend on one tier one and one tier two consumer finance company to provide financing packages to our customers  a deterioration of the consumer finance market or failure by the finance company to provide financing to our customers could negatively impact sales of our direct marketed products 
in purchasing our products  approximately of our direct marketed customers utilize financing packages provided by one of two independent finance companies 
tier two financing is distinguished from tier one in that the tier two finance company is willing to approve customers who are a higher risk of default 
the financing agreements with both companies involve non recourse customer financing  but tier two financing requires a higher discount in order for the finance company to accept the increased risk 
we believe that 
table of contents convenient consumer financing is an important tool in our direct marketing efforts and induces many of our customers to make purchases when they otherwise would not 
consumers may be less likely to purchase our products if the consumer finance market were to deteriorate so that financing is less available or less convenient to our customers 
although we believe we could enter into similar arrangements with other providers if needed  a failure by our current providers to adequately service our customers could temporarily disrupt sales 
changes in foreign conditions could impair our international sales 
a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the united states 
for the year ended december   international sales represented approximately of consolidated net sales 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import and export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have primarily invested cash with banks and in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
our bank deposits may exceed federally insured limits  and there is risk of loss of the entire principal with any debt instrument 
to reduce risk of loss  we limit our exposure to any individual debt issuer and require certain minimum ratings for debt instruments that we purchase 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to foreign exchange risk from currency fluctuations  mainly in europe 
given the relative size of the company s current foreign operations  the company does not believe the exposure to changes in applicable foreign currencies to be material  such that it could have a significant impact on our current or near term financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
management estimates the maximum impact on stockholders equity of a change in any applicable foreign currency to be million 
interest rate risk the company has financed its growth through cash generated from operations 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings and was not subject to any related interest rate risk 
the company invests in liquid debt instruments purchased with maturity dates of less than one year 
due to the short term nature of those investments  management believes that any reasonably possible near term changes in related interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
