item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  engaged in the ownership  acquisition  management and redevelopment of apartment properties 
our property operations are characterized by diversification of product  location and price point 
as of december   we owned or managed a real estate portfolio of  apartment properties containing  units located in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases 
the key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are funds from operations  or ffo  less spending for capital replacements and capital enhancements  same store property operating results  net operating income less spending for capital replacements and capital enhancements  or free cash flow  financial coverage ratios  and leverage as shown on our balance sheet 
these terms are defined and described in the sections captioned funds from operations and capital expenditures below 
the key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are rates of job growth  unemployment rates  single family and multifamily starts  and interest rates 
because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties  the supply and demand for apartments substantially influences our results 
additionally  the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties and the pace and price at which we redevelop  acquire and dispose of our apartment properties can affect our operating results 
our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms which we negotiate for our equity and debt financings 
we have grown rapidly over the past decade  and during the past three years our growth has moderated 
in  the apartment industry continued to face a challenging operating environment unemployment  job growth at a pace slower than anticipated  low interest rates and an abundant supply of housing alternatives 
in addition  we experienced greater difficulty as compared to our peers because our property operating systems and structure were not as effective as our peers in meeting the challenges presented by the apartment markets 
we are adjusting our business strategies to compete successfully in challenging times and to be ready to maximize our opportunities as the economy improves 
we are focused on improving our conventional property operations  which are conducted through regional operating centers  or rocs 
this structure provides us with the opportunity to keep decision making close to the customers we serve and the properties we maintain 
we are focused on providing our rocs with more resources and better systems and reducing employee turnover 
we are standardizing numerous processes  including such items as price setting and resident selection 
our focus on resident selection is designed to make our communities more desirable places to live and work  which will result in better financial performance due to higher and more stable occupancy levels  increased pricing power and reduced costs 
we were highly focused throughout in addressing property operations and those efforts will continue throughout in addition  we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through redevelopment and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in item of this annual report 
results of operations overview compared to we recognized net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was principally due to a decline in consolidated same store net operating results of in compared to  higher depreciation and interest expenses due to the acquisition of apartment properties  lower interest income as a result of a decline in accretion income recognized on general partner notes receivable  and a decrease in the operations of our investment management business 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain relating to unconsolidated entities due to property sales  an increase in net operating income due to the acquisition of apartment properties  and lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results 
compared to we recognized net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was principally due to an increase in net operating income due to the acquisition of apartment properties  lower depreciation expense due to a change in estimate related to the useful lives of real estate assets  higher equity in earnings in our unconsolidated real estate partnerships due to a change in estimate related to the useful lives of real estate assets  lower minority interest allocations as a result of lower property operating results  a decrease in deficit distributions to minority partners  and a reduction in amortization of intangibles 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in loss on disposition of real estate including the loss recognized in discontinued operations and the loss relating to unconsolidated entities due primarily to a change in estimate associated with historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of properties and the sale of certain senior living facilities in  a decline in consolidated same store net operating results of in compared to  higher depreciation and interest expenses due to the acquisition of apartment properties  and a decrease in the operations of our investment management business 
the following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting our results of operations in more detail 
rental property operations our net income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties 
the principal components within our total consolidated property operations are as follows consolidated same store properties consist of all conventional properties that were owned  stabilized and consolidated for all periods presented 
acquisition properties consist of all consolidated properties that were owned less than three years as of the end of the most recent year 
for purposes of this discussion  acquisition properties are principally comprised of three properties directly purchased in  those properties acquired in the march acquisition of casden properties  inc and certain related transactions  which we refer to collectively  as the casden merger  those properties acquired in the august acquisition of new england area properties  which we refer to as the new england properties acquisition  two properties directly purchased in and three properties directly purchased in newly consolidated properties consist of all properties consolidated for less than three years as of the end of the most recent year 
these properties had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method 
for purposes of this discussion  newly consolidated properties include properties that were first consolidated in  properties that were first consolidated in and five properties that were first consolidated in affordable properties consist of all affordable properties which are properties that benefit from governmental programs designed to provide housing for people with low or moderate incomes that were owned  stabilized and consolidated for all periods presented 
redevelopment properties consist of all consolidated properties where i a substantial number of available units have been vacated for major renovations and have not been stabilized for at least one year as of the earliest period presented  or ii other significant renovation such as exteriors  common areas or unit improvements on lease expirations is underway or has been complete for less than one year as of the earliest period presented 
in both cases  the properties have been removed from same store properties 
other properties consist of all consolidated properties that are not included in the above categories and in some cases are not multifamily properties such as commercial properties and retail space 
partnership expenses consist of expenses incurred at the partnership level either directly or indirectly such as partnership audit  tax and legal expenses 
property management expenses consist of off site expenses associated with the self management of consolidated properties 
the following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  rental and other property revenues    property operating expenses    net operating income    the following table shows the components of consolidated property net operating income for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  consolidated same store properties    acquisition properties    newly consolidated properties    affordable properties    redevelopment properties    other properties    partnership expenses    property management expenses    other  total    during as compared to  net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million related to operations of newly consolidated properties and operations of acquisition properties  respectively 
this was offset by a million  or  decrease in consolidated same store net operating income 
see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
during as compared to  net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million related to operations of acquisition properties and operations of newly consolidated properties  respectively 
this was offset by a million  or  decrease in consolidated same store net operating income 
see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
conventional same store property operating results same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties 
we define same store properties as conventional properties in which our ownership interest exceeds and the operations of which are stabilized for all periods presented 
to ensure comparability  the information for all periods shown is based on current period ownership 
the following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations on a same store basis which is not in accordance with gaap and reconciles them to consolidated same store operations  a component of consolidated rental property operations which is in accordance with gaap described in the above comparative discussions dollars in thousands year ended december  our share of same store revenues    our share of same store expense    our share of same store net operating income   minority partners share of same store net operating income  our share of unconsolidated same store net operating income  newly consolidated properties    consolidated same store component of net operating income  same store statistics properties apartment units    average physical occupancy average rent collected unit month for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income decreased million  or 
revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower average rent down per unit  lower occupancy down  and increased bad debt 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in turnover  marketing and administrative costs in related to focused efforts to improve property appearance and the condition of units ready to be occupied  million in contract services and repairs and maintenance primarily driven by seasonal factors such as landscaping and snow removal due to more severe winter conditions in than in  million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas  electric  water and sewer  and million in property hazard insurance due to increased casualty losses 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income decreased million  or 
revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower occupancy down  and increased bad debt 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in property taxes  million in insurance expense  as the cost of property hazard insurance coverage rose in march  and million in contract services and repairs and maintenance 
these increases were somewhat offset by reductions in utilities 
investment management business we earn income from our consolidated investment management business primarily from unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner 
the income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property and asset management 
asset management involves the financial management of properties  as opposed to the day to day property operations  and results in fees from a variety of transactions including refinancing fees  developer fees and syndication fees 
these transactions occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period 
our revenue from the investment management business decreases as we increase our ownership of properties and the income generated is therefore eliminated in consolidation 
we expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by gaap 
offsetting the revenue earned in the investment management business are the expenses associated with property and asset management  as well as expenses related to our risk management and other insurance programs 
the following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated investment management business for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  management fees and other income primarily from affiliates  management and other expenses    net income from investment management business   during as compared to  income from investment management business decreased by million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of the following million due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships  which required additional elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships  million due to increased consulting fees associated with the implementation of site level software and legal fees  and million related to insurance  of which million was related to an increase in general liability  worker s compensation and director and officer insurance premium expenses offset by million of a reduction in casualty losses in the property hazard program 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased activity based fees related to syndication  acquisition and deferred asset management fees from transactions closed in  and million due to income tax benefits including million of an income tax valuation reserve reversal in first quarter see note of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report  and million of an income tax benefit resulting from losses recorded at our taxable reit subsidiaries 
during as compared to  income from the investment management business decreased by million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of the following million of reduced fees billed for construction management services in we calculated and billed these fees to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities 
in addition  lower costs were incurred and therefore lower billings occurred as a result of the ongoing management initiative to contain costs  million due to an increase in insurance costs in the property hazard program 
these increased costs were the result of increased reserves due to historical casualty losses from prior years  million due to an increase in consolidated real estate partnerships  which required additional elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such real estate partnerships  million due to a net reduction in fees including million decrease in refinancing and disposition fees  due to decreased refinancing transactions in compared to in resulting in lower fees earned  and a million decrease in fees earned for services provided to third parties due to a planned reduction in third party asset management 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in asset management and developer fees related to the acquisition of national partnership investments corp 
as part of the casden merger 
these decreases were partially offset by million of lower compensation and health insurance expense resulting from a change in plan administrator and a reduction in work force  in part due to a planned reduction in third party property management and management cost reduction initiatives 
depreciation of rental property for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   depreciation of rental property increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties  respectively  as well as million of additional depreciation related to new capital spending on same store properties 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   depreciation of rental property decreased million  or 
this decrease was principally due to a million decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets made in during  we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation 
as a result of this review  we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings 
we believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice 
this change in useful lives increased net income by approximately million  net of minority interest  in over  of which a portion was recognized as an increase to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
the recognition of this change in useful lives resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties of million and million  respectively 
amortization of intangibles for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   amortization of intangibles increased million  or 
this increase was principally a result of additional amortization recognized due to the termination of certain management contracts acquired in the casden merger 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   amortization of intangibles decreased million  or 
of the total decrease  million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully amortized in  and million was attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
provision for losses on accounts  fees and notes receivable for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   provision for losses on accounts  fees and notes receivable decreased million  or 
for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   provision for losses on accounts  fees and notes receivable increased million  or 
in  the entire provision of million related to additional allowance for possible losses on accounts  fees and other contingencies 
in  the entire provision of million related to provision for losses on notes receivable  which provision was determined based on our review in of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio 
in  we recorded a million provision for losses on notes receivable 
we continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis and may record a provision due to changes in the market environment that affect operating cash flows 
interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional interest on the debt related to the newly consolidated properties and the acquisition properties  respectively 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional interest on the debt related to the acquisition properties and the newly consolidated properties  respectively 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction related to an overall decrease in variable interest rates of approximately from the prior year 
interest and other income a component of interest and other income is our accretion income on general partner notes receivable 
transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest and other income decreased million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of million in reduced accretion income  million in lower interest due from general partner notes receivable  resulting from the consolidation of real estate partnerships  and therefore the elimination of interest income  as well as the collection of outstanding notes receivable  and million related to gain recognized in second quarter on the sale of certain tax exempt bonds 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest and other income increased million  or 
this increase was principally a result of million in increased accretion income 
this increase was offset by million of a decrease related to a lower gain recognized on certain tax exempt bonds that were sold in as compared to certain tax exempt bonds sold in in addition there was a million decrease related to lower interest on money market and interest bearing accounts  as interest rates on deposit accounts had decreased approximately from the prior year  while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   equity in losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased million 
this increase was principally the result of the purchase of equity interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships that resulted in these properties becoming consolidated 
such real estate partnerships owned better performing properties that are now contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses 
in addition  the remaining properties within unconsolidated real estate partnerships had decreased earnings driven by lower property operating results in than in for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships increased million 
this increase was principally due to the change in estimate of useful lives of the underlying real estate assets completed by us in  which resulted in lower depreciation expense of approximately million 
see the previous discussion on the change in estimate of useful lives of assets under the heading depreciation of rental property 
deficit distributions to minority partners when real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of their minority interest balances  we record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over their minority interest balances  even though there is no economic effect or cost 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million  or 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million 
each of these decreases were due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity  and decreased operating results  as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships 
gain loss on dispositions of real estate for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate increased million 
in  gain loss on dispositions of real estate included a loss of approximately million that resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold 
the recognition of this amount in was considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties 
the recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate decreased million 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas pursuant to sfas we now report as discontinued operations assets held for sale as defined by sfas and assets sold in the current period see below discussion 
as a result of sfas  for the year ended december   gain loss on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during for  however  gain loss on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with the disposal of all properties sold 
the properties sold in all periods  as well as the properties held for sale  were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
gain loss on properties sold was determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences 
minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased million 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased million 
both of these decreases were principally a result of decreased earnings caused by lower property operating results than in the prior year and our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships  thereby reducing the minority interest allocation 
discontinued operations for properties accounted for under sfas  the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses  depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale  property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest 
in addition  any impairments on assets held for sale  and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale is reported as discontinued operations 
for the years ended december    and  income from discontinued operations totaled million  million and million  respectively  which includes income from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
in  the income from operations included properties that were sold or classified as held for sale during in  and  the income from operations included properties that were sold or classified as held for sale in and due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales  the income from operations is not comparable year to year 
during  we sold properties  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment loss on assets sold or held for sale in during  we sold properties  resulting in a net loss on sale of approximately million including million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairments on assets sold or held for sale in there were no gains or losses on assets sold in included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  gains losses on properties sold are determined on a property by property basis and are not comparable year over year due to individual property differences 
we considered the properties sold  as well as the properties classified as held for sale  to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for more details on discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  unless considered impaired 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired  we make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include the general economic climate  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options  local conditions  such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments  that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance  increases in operating costs including real estate taxes due to inflation and other factors  which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents  changes in tax laws and housing laws  including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in market capitalization rates  and the relative illiquidity of such investments 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets  including real estate  goodwill and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
notes receivable and interest income recognition we generally recognize interest income earned from our investments in notes receivable when the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and reasonably estimable 
the notes receivable were either extended by us and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest  which we refer to as par value notes  or were made by predecessors whose positions we acquired usually at a discount  which we refer to as discounted notes 
on a periodic basis we assess the collectibility or impairment of each note 
under the cost recovery method  we carry the discounted notes at the acquisition amount  less subsequent cash collections  until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are reasonably estimable 
based upon closed or pending transactions which include sales  refinancings  foreclosures and rights offerings  we have determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value 
accordingly  we recognize accretion income on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans  as the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value 
for the year ended december   if we had not been able to complete certain transactions  our accretion income would have decreased by million million per basic and diluted share 
accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes  therefore  accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods 
allowance for losses on notes receivable we estimate the collectibility of notes receivable by assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables 
we establish an allowance for losses on notes receivable based on an evaluation of a variety of factors  such as an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio  an evaluation of the risk inherent in the portfolio  including the current credit worthiness of each borrower  the composition of the portfolio  including specific impaired notes receivable  current economic conditions  full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loss experience  our estimate of probable credit losses and other factors 
during the years ended december  and  we identified and recorded million and million in losses on notes receivable  respectively 
we will continue to monitor and assess these notes  and we may make changes in required reserves in the future due to changes in the market environment 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs including salaries  interest  real estate taxes and other costs incurred in connection with redevelopment  initial capital expenditures  disposition capital expenditures  capital enhancement and capital replacement activities 
we charge to expense as incurred indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities  including general and administrative expenses 
the amounts capitalized depend on the volume  timing and costs of such activities 
as a result  changes in volume  timing and costs of such activities may have a significant effect on our financial results if the costs being capitalized are not proportionately increased or reduced  as the case may be 
based on the level of capital spending during  if capital activities had increased or decreased during the year by  we could have had additional or lower  respectively  income before minority interest of million 
see further discussion under the heading capital expenditures 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure that we believe  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with gaap  is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery  computers or other personal property 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items  gains on dispositions of depreciable real estate  gains on dispositions of real estate from discontinued operations  net of related income taxes  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships  joint ventures and discontinued operations 
we calculate ffo based on the nareit definition  as further adjusted for amortization of intangibles and deficit distributions to minority partners 
we calculate ffo diluted by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock  adding back dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities and adding back the interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts  there can be no assurance that our basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 
for the years ended december   and  our ffo is calculated as follows amounts in thousands net income attributable to common stockholders   adjustments depreciation on rental property  net of minority partners interest depreciation on rental property related to unconsolidated entities gain loss on dispositions of real estate   deficit distributions to minority partners   amortization of intangibles    income tax arising from disposals  gain on disposition of land  discontinued operations depreciation on rental property  net of minority partners interest gain loss on dispositions of real estate  net of minority partners interest   deficit distributions to minority partners   income tax arising from disposals   minority interest in aimco operating partnership s share of above adjustments    preferred stock dividends    redemption related preferred stock issuance costs  funds from operations    preferred stock dividends    redemption related preferred stock issuance costs  dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities  interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities funds from operations attributable to common stockholders diluted weighted average number of common shares  common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding common shares and equivalents    dilutive preferred securities    total    cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities  cash flow used in provided by financing activities  notes represents our numerator for earnings per common share calculated in accordance with gaap minority partners interest  as referenced on this line item and others in this presentation means minority interest in aimco s consolidated real estate partnerships represents our denominator for earnings per common share diluted calculated in accordance with gaap liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management 
both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations 
additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans 
our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  capital expenditures  dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners  and acquisitions of  and investments in  properties 
we use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs 
in the event that the cash provided by operating activities no longer covers our short term liquidity demands  we have additional means  such as short term borrowing availability  proceeds from property sales and refinancings  to help us meet our short term liquidity demands 
we use the revolver described below for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term borrowings  both secured and unsecured  the issuance of debt or equity securities including op units  the sale of properties and cash generated from operations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents including million of cash and cash equivalents that is included within assets held for sale  an increase of million from december   which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance on the revolver 
at december   we had million of restricted cash including million of restricted cash that is included within assets held for sale  primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds  capital expenditures  property taxes and insurance 
in addition  cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis 
the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this annual report 
operating activities for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily due to operating income from our consolidated properties  which is determined by rental rates  occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties 
this was a decrease of million as compared to the year ended december   driven by lower property operating results 
we intend for our net cash from operating activities to fund dividends paid to stockholders 
investing activities for the year ended december   our net cash provided by investing activities of million was primarily from proceeds received from sales of properties  offset by investments in our existing real estate assets through capital expenditures and redevelopment see further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading capital expenditures 
although we hold all of our properties for investment  we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment  in both cases  as compared to alternative uses for our capital 
in the year ended december   we sold consolidated properties  one consolidated land parcel  and unconsolidated properties 
these were sold for an aggregate sales price of million  of which million related to the consolidated properties and land parcel 
our share of the total net proceeds  after repayment of existing debt  payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners  was million  of which million related to the unconsolidated properties  which proceeds were included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
these proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness  redeem preferred securities  and for other corporate purposes 
we are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
proceeds from dispositions are expected to be slightly below the levels of  and we plan to use such proceeds to reduce debt  redeem preferred securities  fund capital expenditures on existing assets  fund property and partnership acquisitions  and for other operating needs and corporate purposes 
financing activities for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities of million related primarily to payments on our secured notes payable  payment of our dividends and redemptions of preferred stock 
these were offset by contributions from minority interest related to our equity financing transaction with ge real estate in the form of a joint venture  proceeds from the issuance of class s cumulative redeemable preferred stock  which we refer to as the class s preferred stock  and class t cumulative preferred stock  which we refer to as the class t preferred stock  proceeds from mortgage refinancings and borrowings under a newly established term loan see notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for further details on these activities

our board of directors has  from time to time  authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock and our preferred stock 
currently  we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately million shares  of which up to million shares may be common stock and up to million shares may be preferred stock 
these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to applicable law 
during the year ended december   we repurchased no shares of our common stock or our preferred stock 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for information on common stock repurchased subsequent to the year ended december  in november  our board of directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend to align the amount of the dividend with our current level of operating profitability 
the dividend paid in february of per share represents a distribution of of diluted adjusted funds from operations  which we refer to as affo  before deducting capital enhancements and of diluted ffo for the quarter ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for the definition of affo 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   we spent a total of million on capital replacements expenditures required to maintain the related asset and million on capital enhancements expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property 
these amounts represent our share of the total spending on both consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships 
capital replacements spending increased slightly over prior periods due to a general increase in spending to maintain our assets 
in addition to capital replacements  we account for capital enhancements  which we distinguish from capital replacements 
capital enhancements are costs incurred to add additional rental square footage or a new revenue producing feature 
for example  replacement of existing kitchen appliances is a capital replacement  however  if the same replacements are done in connection with an extensive remodeling project that is expected to generate higher rents  then they are characterized as a capital enhancement 
because the distinction between capital replacements and capital enhancements is not consistently applied across reits and because there is a risk of partial substitution between capital replacements and capital enhancements  we account for and report both capital replacements and capital enhancements and deduct both in our calculation of affo see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for the definition of affo 
the table below details our actual spending on capital replacements and capital enhancements based on a per unit and total dollar basis based on approximately  ownership equivalent units for the year ended december  and reconciles it to our consolidated statement of cash flows in item of this annual report for the same period in thousands  except per unit data

in this period  ice relates primarily to the properties acquired in the casden merger and the new england properties acquisition

our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships ranges from to 
however  based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements  which grant varying degrees of control  we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes 
in  financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  which changes the criteria for consolidating entities 
we are currently evaluating our treatment of these unconsolidated real estate partnerships under fin  which we will adopt in first quarter see note of the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or any other material market rate or price risks 
we use predominantly long term  fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings 
we use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities  property sales proceeds or long term debt financings 
we had  million of floating rate debt outstanding at december  of the total floating debt  the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing million  floating rate secured notes million  the revolving credit facility million  term loans million  and the class s preferred stock million 
based on this level of debt  an increase in interest rates of would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
historically  changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than with changes in taxable interest rates 
floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the bma index  which since has averaged of the year treasury yield 
if this relationship continues  an increase in interest rates of in tax exempt interest rates would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
at december   we had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
as of december   based on our level of floating rate debt of  million  an increase in interest rates of would have resulted in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
the potential reduction of income before minority interests and cash flows due to an increase in interest rates increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   as a result of the additional debt related to our acquisitions and newly consolidated properties and the issuance of the class s preferred stock 
as of december   the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds were as follows dollars in thousands amortization maturities total percentage thereafter
