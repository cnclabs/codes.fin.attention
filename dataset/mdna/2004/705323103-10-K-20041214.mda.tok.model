item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements products  services and operations products and services we provide a broad range of healthcare services and products principally for children and  to a lesser extent  young adults and geriatric patients 
we define pediatric as age eighteen and younger with the remainder defined as adult 
some of the patients who began service with us as children and reached the age of eighteen will subsequently be classified as an adult 
the following table summarizes both products and services based upon estimated percentages of net billings of each major category for the periods indicated 
year ended september  total total total pediatric home health care nursing and ppec respiratory therapy equipment and services pharmacy total pediatric home health care adult home health care nursing respiratory therapy equipment and services pharmacy total adult home health care total pediatric health care services pediatric nursing services 
our pediatric nursing services consist primarily of private duty home nursing care for pediatric patients with illnesses and conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia  digestive and absorptive diseases  congenital heart defects and other cardiovascular disorders  cancer  cerebral palsy  cystic fibrosis  obstructive and restrictive pulmonary disease eg  bronchitis and asthma  endocrinology disorders  hemophilia  orthopedic conditions and post surgical needs 
pediatric home nursing care typically begins upon the patient s discharge from the hospital 
under a prescription or care plan developed by the patient s physician  our nurses and therapists monitor the condition of the child  administer medications and treatment regimens  provide enteral and other forms of tube feeding  monitor and maintain ventilators  oxygen and other home medical equipment  monitor and administer pain management  provide daily care  including baths  hygiene and skin care  conduct physical and other forms of prescribed therapy  and coordinate other forms of medical care necessary for the child 
home nursing care is often provided up to hours per day for extended periods of time 
we estimate that our pediatric patients require private duty nursing care for an average of eight months with length of daily care averaging approximately ten hours 
our nurses emphasize education of the caregivers of the child to maximize the independence of the child and the family 
through this educational process  the length of daily private duty care can be modified as the child s condition improves or stabilizes and the parents or caregivers assume a more active role in the care of the child 
depending on the condition of the child and the orders of the attending physician  we may continue to provide nursing visits  respiratory therapy and other medical equipment and pharmaceutical services after we discontinue private duty nursing care 
we have approximately  registered or licensed pediatric nurses on our active nursing registries 
due to the special needs and acuity of care of pediatric patients  generally  we require that our nurses have training with pediatric patients 
most of our nurses have expanded pediatric experience  such as nicu  picu or equivalent experience 

table of contents 
index to financial statements prior to the discharge of a medically fragile child from the hospital  referral sources generally make arrangements for nursing services before making arrangements for other health care services such as equipment or infusion 
consequently  a high quality and well trained nursing service can help market our other pediatric product lines and services based on patient needs 
prescribed pediatric extended care ppec 
our ppec centers provide  among other services  daily medical care and physical  occupational and other forms of therapy for medically fragile and chronically ill children 
the children receive nursing supervision and or physical  occupational and other therapies in a setting that allows for socialization and education of the children 
the children generally spend between to hours per week at the center according to their individual plan of treatment 
we currently operate ppec centers in florida  georgia and north carolina 
pediatric respiratory therapy  equipment and services rtes 
we provide respiratory therapy equipment services to pediatric patients in the home 
the services include i the rental  sale  delivery and setup in accordance with physician prescriptions of equipment  such as ventilators  oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  high pressure oxygen cylinders  apnea monitors and nebulizers  ii periodic evaluation and maintenance of the equipment and iii delivery and setup of disposable supplies necessary for the operation of the equipment 
our branch offices provide rental of home medical equipment as well as mail order programs for the provision of a broad range of home health care supplies 
we provide these services to patients with a variety of conditions  including obstructive and restrictive pulmonary diseases  neurologically related respiratory problems  cystic fibrosis  congenital heart defects and cancer 
we utilize skilled registered respiratory therapists  certified respiratory therapy technicians  and other qualified health professionals to provide these services 
we also provide training to patients and their families in equipment use and service through emergency on call technicians 
in addition  we provide rental  sale and service of home medical equipment and respiratory therapy services to adult and pediatric patients with a focus on high tech products including ventilators  oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  continuous positive airway pressure devices cpap  bi level respiratory assist devices bi pap  and oximetry and apnea monitors 
these services are provided to patients upon their discharge from the hospital as well as after our nursing services are no longer required 
specialty pharmacy and infusion therapy services pharmacy 
we provide pharmaceutical products and services for our patients in the home or physician s office 
pharmacy services include clinical drug management  patient counseling  compliance monitoring  side effect management  educational information and reimbursement services for complex drug regimens 
specialty pharmacy provides self injectable biotech medications for chronic diseases while infusion therapy involves the intravenous administration of nutrients  antibiotics and other medications 
the number of therapies that can be administered safely in the home has increased significantly in recent years because of technological innovations in infusion equipment and advances in drug therapy 
consequently  a broad range of drug therapies are now considered safe and effective for treatment in the home 
these in home therapies reduce the need for emergency room visits  decrease the number of days patients stay in the hospital and are generally preferred by patients  their families and caregivers  as well as referring physicians and payors 
we provide a range of pharmacy and infusion therapies  including hemophilia therapy  antibiotic and other anti infective therapies  total parenteral nutrition therapy  pain management therapy  growth hormone therapy  immunomodular therapy and chemotherapy 
we also provide specialty infusion therapies intended to meet the needs of patients with a variety of serious infections such as osteomyelitis  bacterial endocarditis  cellulitis  septic arthritis  wound infections  recurrent infections associated with the kidney and urinary tract  and aids 
in addition  we provide drug therapies to terminally or chronically ill patients suffering from acute or chronic pain  patients with impaired or altered digestive tracts due to gastrointestinal illness  patients suffering from various types of cancer  patients requiring treatment for congestive heart failure and patients with chronic conditions such as hemophilia  cystic fibrosis  juvenile rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and endocrinology disorders 
our specialty infusion therapy services are provided by our staff of licensed pharmacists and administered by our nursing staff 
we currently support the home infusion therapy market through our pharmacy locations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we also operate a mail order medication service that provides physician prescribed unit dose medications to respiratory therapy patients 
we offer our patients medication in a premixed unit dose form as well as professional clinical support and claims processing 
we employ licensed pharmacists to assist with our unit dose medication services business 
young adult and geriatric health care services we generally offer young adult patients health care equipment and pharmacy services similar to those provided to pediatric patients 
our young adult patients are generally being treated for disorders such as muscular dystrophy  cystic fibrosis  hemophilia  cardiovascular disorders and cancer  as well as serious disabilities from accidents and other forms of trauma involving spinal cord or other injuries 
few of these patients require private duty nursing services 
frequently  our young adult patients receive home care as a continuation of a pediatric home care treatment regimen 
our geriatric home care patients generally require the lowest acuity of care and have shorter periods of service and shorter periods of daily care than either our pediatric or young adult patients 
few of these patients receive private duty nursing services 
most of these patients receive maintenance care for end of life conditions such as emphysema or other pulmonary disorders  cardiac diseases and renal diseases 
services are provided during short home visits by respiratory therapists or technicians 
although some of our geriatric home care patients receive higher acuity intervention care  these services are more likely to be provided in an institutional setting 
operations recruiting  training and retention of professional staff our pediatric services are generally provided by skilled pediatric nurses and skilled respiratory therapists 
nurses typically have pediatric  nicu  picu or equivalent experience  a nursing license and current cpr certification 
each nurse must pass a written pediatric competency and medication exam and provide employment references 
therapists generally have a minimum of one year prior experience and current cpr certification  and must provide employment references as well 
under our pediatric nursing training program  nurses are required to attend an orientation program where they are trained in aspects of home health care  such as equipment use  that differ from institutionally provided health care 
if qualified  nurses receive additional training in the use of ventilators and other home respiratory equipment 
we require our nurses to attend continuing education sessions on safety and techniques in home health care 
further  to assist in the retention of qualified personnel  we offer our nurses periodic continuing education courses and professional seminars on various topics in home health care 
as of september   we had approximately  licensed or credentialed nurses  therapists  and pharmacists on our staff and active registries 
to provide a qualified  reliable nursing and therapy services staff  we continuously recruit registered nurses  licensed practical nurses  respiratory therapists  licensed pharmacists  home health aids and technical specialists  and offer training and other programs to encourage retention of these professionals 
we recruit primarily through internet websites  advertising  employment fairs  direct mail and employee referral programs that use rewards and other benefit programs to encourage new employee referrals by existing employees 
the health care industry in total and the home health industry more acutely  have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting qualified nurses due primarily to career shortages and lack of enrollment in nurse training programs 
as a result  we have eight nurse recruiting specialists on staff that provide support services to local nurse recruiting efforts to maximize their effectiveness 
furthermore  current indications suggest that the supply of licensed qualified nurses will continue to decline in the foreseeable future 
quality assurance we have an established quality assurance program for the implementation and monitoring of service standards 
our quality assurance program includes audits  surveys  assessments and evaluations as well as other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements measures designed to ensure compliance with the documentation and operating procedures required by federal  state and local law  as well as our internal standards 
our compliance officer oversees the results of these quality assurance audits and implements changes where necessary 
we and all of our branch offices are fully accredited by the community health accreditation program or chap 
chap is a national leader in the accreditation of community based organizations  has a keen understanding of the home health industry and is a recognized accreditation body by payors 
chap offers real world based survey processes  standards  and expectations 
chap is an independent subsidiary of the national league for nursing 
case administration prior to providing services to a patient  we coordinate with the patient s physicians  third party payors  case managers and other referral sources 
to provide better quality services  we have developed and implemented case management and clinical coordination functions 
case management 
we employ case managers to ensure the cost effective delivery of high quality care to many of our highest acuity patients covered by commercial insurance 
we assign a case manager to review the patient s insurance status to determine coverage and relevant reimbursement criteria 
the case manager contacts the relevant third party payors to negotiate the services that will be covered and the applicable rates 
the case manager then communicates with our billing and collection department to assist in accurate billing 
the case manager also assists in resolving disputes that may arise between us and third party payors 
clinical coordination 
we assign a clinical coordinator to higher acuity patients  typically before the patient is discharged from the hospital 
the clinical coordinator works with the physician  case manager or other referral source to arrange all home health care services needed by the patient 
sales and marketing we obtain patient referrals primarily from case managers  neonatologists  pediatricians  pulmonologists  internists and other physicians  hospital discharge planners  community based health care institutions and social service agencies 
we market our services to these referral sources through our managed care marketing personnel  sales and marketing personnel  branch office personnel and various media formats 
the branch office directors coordinate the various sales and marketing activities at the branch office level 
branch office directors generally have a clinical background as registered nurses and or therapists and  as such  they are able to describe and promote our services to referral sources 
the branch office directors attempt to cultivate relationships with their local referral sources through quality service  personal contacts and education about the appropriate role and benefits of our services in the treatment of patients 
we also promote referrals by seeking to arrange preferred provider contracts with managed care companies 
we have established preferred provider arrangements that are both national and regional in scope 
the contracts typically designate us as a preferred provider of certain services in select areas but do not establish an exclusive relationship 
the preferred provider contracts typically set forth a range of services that we may provide and the applicable rates for such services 
the contracts also specify required billing and claims procedures  record maintenance policies and other requirements 
we have not entered into any contracts with health maintenance organizations or other third party payors that require services to be rendered on a risk sharing or capitated basis 
we believe that chap accreditation of our offices is an important factor in our sales and marketing efforts 
we also believe that our focus on pediatric health care services  combined with management s experience in rendering these services  provide us with a significant sales and marketing advantage 

table of contents 
index to financial statements billing and collection we derive substantially all of our net revenue from commercial third party and selected private payors  medicare and medicaid 
the current reimbursement environment is complex  involving multiple payors with differing coverage and reimbursement policies 
management of accounts receivable  through effective billing  collection and reimbursement procedures  is critical to the financial success of health care service providers due to lengthy reimbursement periods 
any significant delay in reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our corporate reimbursement specialists work closely with the branch offices and the payors 
each specialist is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the documentation  submitting the documentation and claims to third party payors and expediting payment 
branch office network we currently provide our health care services through a network of over branch offices  including satellite offices and new branch offices  located in states 
we seek to address local market needs through our branch office network 
each branch office conducts local marketing efforts  recruits personnel and coordinates patient care 
we believe that the business of providing health care services is local in nature and is most effective if each branch office is proactive and or reactive to and meets the needs of the local community 
while allowing our branch office managers sufficient autonomy to address local needs  we provide our branch office managers support and direction from the corporate office including  training  comprehensive policies and procedures and standardized operating systems 
in addition  our local market staff routinely collaborates with the appropriate community and regulatory authorities on our behalf and that of our patients 
for financial reporting purposes  our branch offices are aggregated into three reportable segments based on their predominant line of net revenue in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
corporate compliance program our corporate compliance program continues to focus its efforts in the areas of fraud and abuse  auditing and monitoring of regulatory compliance  training of our employees and providing support and guidance for employees as they strive to comply with the rules  regulations and policies governing or applying to us and our operations 
the compliance officer reports directly to our board of directors 
the compliance department has conducted audits in the areas of billing  payroll  and medical documentation at selected branch offices throughout our company 
the compliance department has been active in establishing several training programs relating to proper documentation  and has provided in service training regarding corporate compliance to substantially all employees 
the compliance department has also been instrumental in the development and implementation of our compliance efforts at the branch office level 
in addition  we have established a toll free compliance hotline to assist in our commitment to ethical conduct throughout our company 
the telephone number is all employees  vendors  contractors and agents are encouraged to use this confidential means of communication to report any compliance issues 
investor relations we maintain an investor relations department that seeks to facilitate effective communication between us and our shareholders within the limitations of applicable regulations 
we also engage an outside investor relations firm to assist in raising our visibility to the investing public  including institutional investors and brokerage firms 
the investor relations department is also charged with the implementation of our corporate governance guidelines as they relate to the investing public 
management information systems our business depends in part upon our ability to input  store  retrieve  process and manage billing and collection information for each patient 
our internally developed encore system provides substantially all of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our locations with immediate access to patient  contract  and payor information and supports substantially all necessary billing  cash posting  and collection services 
we continue to make improvements in billing functionality to comply with payor contract requirements 
we plan to continue extending electronic billing and funds transfer capabilities to more payors 
we continue to invest in upgrades to our technical infrastructure to maximize information system reliability  data integrity and disaster recoverability 
there can be no assurance that our information systems will continue to perform as expected  or that further development will not be required 
failure of our management information systems to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
internal audit we maintain an internal audit function that reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the primary role of the internal audit function is to execute the branch office audit program  designed and approved by the audit committee 
ongoing risk assessments are performed to indicate which branch offices are to be selected for transaction and process control tests 
our internal audit department is also leading our sarbanes oxley section compliance project 
we are required to comply with sarbanes oxley section as of september  we have retained consultants to assist in the documentation and testing of our internal controls and procedures 
reimbursement we focus our health care marketing efforts on patients with private insurance and governmental payors 
due to the nature of our business  many of our patients rely on medicare and medicaid for health coverage 
the following are the estimated percentages of our net revenue from operations attributable to reimbursement from various payors for the health care services we currently provide  for the periods presented year ended september  payor commercial insurance and other private payors medicaid and other state programs medicare and other federal programs total during the past decade  federal and state governments and private payors have taken extensive steps intended to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
these steps have included  among others  reduced reimbursement rates  changes in and reduction of services covered  increased prospective  concurrent and retrospective utilization review of services  negotiated prospective or discounted contract pricing and adoption of a competitive bid approach to service contracts 
cost containment efforts are expected to continue in the future 
home health care  which is usually less costly than hospital based care  generally has benefited from certain of these cost containment efforts 
as expenditures on home health care services have grown  however  initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of health care delivery in non institutional settings have increased 
many state medicaid programs  in an effort to contain the cost of health care and in light of state budgetary constraints  have reduced their payment rates and have narrowed the scope of covered services 
likewise  the federal government  through legislation and regulation  has acted repeatedly to limit expenditures for health care  including home health services  respiratory and home medical equipment 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a significant change in coverage or a reduction in payment rates for the types of services we provide could have a material adverse effect upon our business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements laws and regulations general 
our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing state and federal regulation 
state laws regulate several aspects of our business  including home health  durable medical equipment dme  oxygen services  and home infusion therapy services including certificates of need and licensure requirements in certain states and dispensing  distributing and compounding of prescription products 
we also are subject to certain state laws prohibiting the payment of remuneration for patient or business referrals and the provision of services where a financial relationship exists between a referring person or entity and the entity providing the service 
federal laws governing our activities include regulation of pharmacy operations and regulation under the medicare and medicaid programs relating to  among other things  certification of home health agencies and reimbursement 
federal fraud and abuse laws prohibit or restrict  among other things  the payment of remuneration to parties in a position to influence or cause the referral of patients or business  as well as the filing of false claims 
changes in or new interpretations of these laws could have an adverse effect on our methods and costs of doing business 
further  failure by us to comply with such laws could adversely affect our ability to continue to provide  or receive reimbursement for  our equipment and services  and also could subject the company and our officers and employees to civil and criminal penalties 
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter regulatory impediments that could adversely affect our ability to open new branch offices or to expand the services currently provided at our existing branch offices 
medicare and medicaid regulations 
as a provider of services under the medicare and medicaid programs the programs  we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing reimbursement procedures and practices 
these laws include the medicare and medicaid fraud and abuse statutes and regulations which  among other provisions  prohibit the payment or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring business or patients to providers for which payments are made by a governmental health care program 
violation of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  including substantial fines  loss of the right to participate in the programs and imprisonment 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa expanded the government s fraud and abuse enforcement powers 
among other provisions  hipaa expands the government s authority to prosecute fraud and abuse beyond medicare and medicaid to all payors  makes exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs mandatory for a minimum of five years for any felony conviction relating to fraud  requires that organizations contracting with another organization or individual take steps to be informed as to whether the organization or individual is excluded from medicare and medicaid participation  and enhances civil penalties by increasing the amount of fines permitted 
these laws also include a prohibition on referrals contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of stark i  which prohibits referrals by physicians to clinical laboratories where the physician has a financial interest  and further prohibitions contained in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of stark ii  which prohibits such referrals for a more extensive range of services  including home health and durable medical equipment 
various federal and state laws impose civil and criminal penalties against participants in the programs who make false claims for payment for services or otherwise engage in false billing practices 
many state laws prohibit the payment or receipt or the offer of anything of value in return for  or to induce  a referral for health care goods or services 
in addition  there are several other statutes that  although they do not explicitly address payments for referrals  could be interpreted as prohibiting the practice 
while similar in many respects to the federal laws  these state laws vary from state to state  are often vague and have sometimes been interpreted inconsistently by courts and regulatory agencies 
private insurers and various state enforcement agencies have also increased their scrutiny of health care providers practices and claims  particularly in the home health and home medical equipment sectors 
in recent years  enforcement of federal fraud and abuse laws  as well as regulatory scrutiny in general  has increasingly focused on the home health care industry 
for example  the government has implemented operation restore trust  a federal investigative initiative focused on home health  home medical equipment and skilled 
table of contents 
index to financial statements nursing facility providers 
operation restore trust is now operational in every state  and millions of dollars in funds fraudulently obtained by providers have been recovered 
the government also has implemented wedge audits  which involve a review of a small sample of patient records to identify non compliance and project an error rate for all claims in a discrete period 
periodic and random audits by intermediaries or by state medicaid agencies may result in delays in receipt or adjustments to the amounts of reimbursement received under the medicare  medicaid or medicaid waiver programs 
there can be no assurance that we will not become the subject of a regulatory or other investigation or proceeding or that our interpretations of applicable health care laws and regulations will not be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost to us  diversion of management s time and attention  and could have a materially adverse effect on our company 
for a discussion of the impact of recent changes to medicare and medicaid regulations please refer to recent developments under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results and operations 
regulation of certain transactions 
the social security act  as amended by hipaa  provides for the mandatory exclusion of providers and related persons from participation in the programs if the individual or entity has been convicted of a criminal offense related to the delivery of an item or service under the programs or relating to neglect or abuse of patients 
further  individuals or entities may be  but are not required to be  excluded from the programs in circumstances including  but not limited to  convictions relating to fraud  obstruction of an investigation of a controlled substance  license revocation or suspension  filing claims for excessive charges or unnecessary services or failure to furnish medically necessary services  or ownership or control by an individual who has been excluded from the programs  against whom a civil monetary penalty related to the programs has been assessed  or who has been convicted of a crime described in this section 
the illegal remuneration provisions of the social security act make it a felony to solicit  receive  offer to pay  or pay any kickback  bribe  or rebate in return for referring a patient for any item or service  or in return for purchasing  leasing or ordering any good  service or item  for which payment may be made under the programs 
other provisions in hipaa proscribe false statements in billing and in meeting reporting requirements and in representations made with respect to the conditions or operations of providers 
a violation of the illegal remuneration statute is a felony and may result in the imposition of criminal penalties  including imprisonment for up to five years and or a fine of up to  further  a civil action to exclude a provider from participation in the programs could occur 
there are also other civil and criminal statutes applicable to the industry  such as those governing false billings and the new health care services offenses contained in hipaa  including health care services fraud  theft or embezzlement  false statements and obstruction of criminal investigation of offenses 
the first criminal conviction and sentencing for a violation of the hipaa privacy rules occurred in november criminal sanctions for these new health care criminal offenses can be severe  including imprisonment for up to twenty years 
legal compliance 
we maintain a compliance program designed to minimize the likelihood that we would engage in conduct or enter into contracts in violation of the fraud and abuse laws 
contracts of the types subject to these laws are reviewed and approved by the managed care and or legal departments 
we also maintain various educational programs designed to keep our managers updated and informed on developments with respect to the fraud and abuse laws and to remind all employees of our policy of strict compliance in this area 
we have established a toll free compliance hotline to assist in our commitment to ethical conduct throughout our company 
while we believe our operations comply with applicable laws and regulations  we  however  cannot provide any assurance that further administrative or judicial interpretations of existing laws or legislative enactment of new laws will not have a materially adverse effect on our business 
medicare certification 
federal regulations governing the medicare program are also applicable to our company 
regulations for medicare reimbursement include an annual review of health care operations and personnel and provide criteria for coverage and reimbursement 
we are medicare certified to provide nursing services in thirteen states  as required 

table of contents 
index to financial statements permits and licensure 
many states require licensure of companies providing pharmacy services  home health care services  home infusion therapy products and services and other products and services of the type offered by our company 
we are currently licensed as a home health agency in twelve states  a home care agency in five states and a pharmacy in nine states 
we also provide unit dose medications by mail order to various states 
certificates of need 
a number of states require companies providing home health care services  home infusion therapy and other services of the type offered by us to have a certificate of need issued by the state s health planning agency 
certificates of need are often difficult to obtain and in many instances are not obtainable at all because an area is determined to be adequately served by existing providers or for other reasons 
if we commence operations in a state  or expand our operations in a state where we are currently operating  and those operations require a certificate of need  we will be required to obtain such certificates of need with respect to those operations 
we currently have certificates of need in five states 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain other required certificates of need and  if so required  we will incur expenses in connection with attempting to obtain such certificates of need 
hipaa 
hipaa s administrative simplification rules mandate that all health care providers  payors and clearinghouses collectively  covered entities  enact measures to protect personally identifiable health information the privacy rules  use standard electronic transaction and code sets the electronic transactions rules and ensure the electronic security of health information the security rules 
multiple sets of regulations  each with its own compliance date  have been issued to clarify and implement the different sets of rules 
the compliance dates for the privacy rules and the electronic transactions rules have already been reached 
the compliance date for the electronic transactions rules  which mandate that covered entities  including our company  transmit claims and certain related healthcare information in standardized formats and data sets  was october  we were materially compliant by that date 
the compliance date for the security rules is april  and we expect to be materially compliant with the rules by that date 
the full effect of hipaa s rules is not yet known  in part because compliance with the security rules is not mandated until april   and also because further amendment of the regulations is likely 
we have formed a committee to coordinate the implementation of the hipaa regulations  have appointed a privacy officer and a security officer  and have established a timeline for full implementation of the guidelines by the mandated compliance deadlines 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that these and other changes will not materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
employees as of september   our health care and related services operations employed  or had on registry  approximately  licensed or credentialed nurses  therapists and pharmacists  and approximately  full time employees and part time employees 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
environmental matters medical facilities are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations  such as air and water quality control requirements  waste management requirements and requirements for training employees in the proper handling and management of hazardous materials and wastes 
our typical branch office facility operations include  but are not limited to  the handling  use  storage  transportation  disposal and or discharge of hazardous  toxic  infectious  flammable and other hazardous materials  waste  pollutants or contaminants 
these activities may result in injury to individuals or damage to property or the environment and may result in legal liability damages  injunctions  fines  penalties or other governmental agency actions 
we are not aware of any pending or threatened claim  investigation or enforcement action regarding environmental issues  which  if determined adversely to us  would have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position

the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material or of which we are not presently aware may become important factors that affect our company in the future 
if any of the risks discussed below actually occur  our business  financial condition  operating results  or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
risks related to our business changes in reimbursement rates or policies  including legislative and regulatory actions  may have a material adverse effect on our revenues or profitability 
the profitability of our business depends on payment and reimbursement from governmental and non governmental third party payors 
federal and state governments as well as commercial third party and selected private payors have taken and continue to take extensive steps intended to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
these steps have included  among others  reductions in reimbursement rates  changes in services covered  increased utilization review of services  negotiated prospective or discounted contract pricing and adoption of a competitive bid approach to service contracts 
cost containment efforts are expected to continue in the future 
we cannot assure you that payments under state or federal governmental programs will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to patients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs 
although home health care  which is generally less costly than hospital based care  has benefited from many of these cost containment efforts  as expenditures in the home health care market continue to grow  governmental and private payor initiatives aimed at reducing the cost of health care delivery at non hospital sites are increasing 
many state medicaid programs  in an effort to contain the cost of health care and in light of state budgetary constraints  have reduced their payment rates and have narrowed the scope of covered services 
initiatives have been implemented in the past and such initiatives are expected to continue in the future 
there can be no assurance that these initiatives will not materially and adversely affect our revenues from these sources and  consequently  our results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the services that we provide and the facilities that we operate will meet or continue to meet the requirements for participation in these programs 
our business may suffer if we lose relationships with payors 
we are highly dependent on reimbursement from non governmental payors 
from time to time  payors with whom we have relationships require that we and our competitors bid to keep their business  and there can be no assurance that we will be retained or that our margins will not be adversely affected when that happens 
the loss of a payor relationship or an adverse change in the financial condition of a payor could result in the loss of a significant number of patients and or the write off of accounts receivables  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

index to financial statements federal and state laws that protect the privacy of patient health information  such as hipaa  may increase our costs  result in delays in reimbursement and limit our ability to collect and use that information 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we may not be able to collect reimbursements for our products and services from third party payors in a timely manner 
we are responsible for submitting reimbursement requests to third party payors and collecting the reimbursements  and assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed reimbursements 
in the current health care environment  we may experience difficulties in collecting reimbursements because third party payors may seek to reduce  by appeal or otherwise  or delay reimbursements to which we are entitled for products and services that we have provided 
our business may be characterized by delays in reimbursement from when we provide products and services to when we receive the reimbursement or payment for these products and services 
this timing delay may cause working capital shortages from time to time 
as a result  working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in our results of operation and liquidity 
we cannot assure you that trends in the industry will not further extend the collection period and adversely impact our working capital or that our working capital management procedures will successfully mitigate this risk 
our business is subject to reimbursement risks due to difficulties in the implementation of the georgia medicaid multi health network system 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below

we are highly dependent on our relationship with a limited number of biopharmaceutical suppliers and the loss of any of these relationships could significantly impact our ability to sustain or grow our revenues

any termination or adverse adjustment to any of these relationships could have a material adverse effect on a significant portion of our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business could be harmed if the supply of any of the products that we distribute becomes scarce 
the biopharmaceutical industry is susceptible to product shortages 
the availability of some of the products that we distribute  such as hemophilia factor and growth hormone  have been constrained from time to time 
there was also an industry wide recombinant factor viii product shortage that existed for some time  as a result of the manufacturers being unable to increase production to meet rising global demand 
if these products  or any of the other drugs that we distribute  are in short supply for long periods of time  our business could be harmed 
we depend on the efforts of health care professionals  the loss of whose services could adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent upon our staff of professional nurses  respiratory therapists and pharmacists 
competition for health care professionals who possess the skills  experience and licenses necessary to meet the requirements of our patients is strong  and salaries and benefit costs relating to these professionals have risen 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract  retain or motivate sufficient numbers of qualified health care professionals could adversely affect our business 
future changes to the supply and demand for certain health care professionals could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and on our ability to maintain or increase our patient base at certain or all of our branch offices 
an inability to continue to increase the number of professionals we recruit would adversely affect our potential for growth 
the cost of attracting health care professionals and providing them with attractive benefit packages may be higher than anticipated and  as a result  our profitability could decline 
moreover  if we are unable to attract and retain these professionals  the quality of our services may decline and  as a result  we could lose patients

we participate in a highly competitive market and competitive pressures may result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability 
the markets for our health care services are highly competitive and are divided among a large number of providers  some of which are national providers  but most of which are either regional or local providers 
in addition to competing with other home health care companies focusing on providing services to pediatric patients  we compete with several large national home health care companies that  while not focusing primarily on the pediatric patient  provide pediatric home health care services as part of a broader service offering 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing sales resources than we have and may  in certain locations  possess licenses or certificates that permit them to provide services that we cannot currently provide 
the competitors also may undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and clients 
increased competition in the future from existing competitors or new entrants may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to maintain or increase our business and could adversely affect our operating results

see recent developments below 
our potential inability to react effectively to changes in the health care industry could adversely affect our operating results 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs  including efforts at national health care reform  trends toward managed care  limits in medicare coverage and reimbursement levels  consolidation of health care distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office based health care practitioners 
the impact of third party pricing pressures and low barriers to entry has dramatically reduced profit margins for health care providers 
continued growth in managed care and capitated plans has pressured health care providers to find ways of becoming more cost competitive 
this has also led to consolidation of health care providers in our market areas 
our inability to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry could adversely affect our operating results 
we cannot predict whether any health care reform efforts will be enacted and what effect any such reforms may have on us or our customers and suppliers

executive summary recent developments home healthcare industry events updates historically  medicare reimbursement for covered drugs has been limited to percent of the published average wholesale price awp for the drug 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma establishes new payment limits and procedures for drugs reimbursed under medicare part b  including drugs used in inhalation therapy 
the final rule  as the mma requires  provides that medicare beneficiaries will be reimbursed at a rate of percent of the volume weighted average selling price the asp 
in addition  providers of inhalation therapy  including our company  will receive a dispensing fee for supplying inhalation therapy 
the dispensing fee will be for thirty days of therapy or for ninety days 
within the pharmacy segment  we are assessing the impact of these changes to our unit dose respiratory products to determine the viability of our long term profitability 
while the long term impact of the mma reforms cannot yet be determined because the recently promulgated regulations are transitional in nature  these and other changes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
for fiscal year  the impact of these regulations to the approximately of our net revenue that is derived from the medicare program is expected to substantially reduce our profitability in the pharmacy segment 
there can be no assurance that we will not face increased margin pressures from subsequent reimbursement changes beyond a number of other pilots and demonstrations are mandated by the mma  signaling the likelihood of continued re design of certain aspects of the medicare program 
while the more immediately visible changes mandated by the mma relate to extension of the medicare benefit to prescription drug coverage  other aspects may impact the operations and profitability of health care providers  including our company 
among other things  the mma mandates a phased in competitive bidding process for medicare procurement of certain durable medical equipment dme  commencing in the ten largest metropolitan statistical areas msas in  followed by the next eighty largest msas in moreover  the secretary of the united states department of health human services has the authority to apply competitive bidding nationally for the highest cost  highest volume items and services and those items and services that the secretary determines to have the largest savings potential 
there will also be at least a five year freeze in the consumer price index update for reimbursement rates for dme where competitive bidding prices are not applicable 
in addition  commencing in  reimbursement for certain items and services eg  oxygen and oxygen equipment that are not subject to competitive bidding will be capped at the rate or the median federal employee health plan price established in  whichever is lower 
we are analyzing the impact of these reimbursement changes to our rtes segment and plan to address the proposed reductions by altering our business model with changes such as reducing costs  growing revenue through our managed care marketing strategies and looking for additional ways to improve productivity 
for fiscal year  the impact of these regulations to the approximately of our net revenue that is derived from the medicare program will be to reduce our profitability in the rtes segment 
there can be no assurance that we will not face increased margin pressures from subsequent reimbursement changes beyond under the mma  there are major changes in the medicare payment rates for hemophilia products beginning in currently  medicare reimburses for blood clotting factor at percent of awp 
effective january   we will be paid for blood clotting factor based on the new asp methodology 
we expect that the resulting payment rates will be lower than the current rates for these products 
in addition  the centers for medicare medicaid services cms will make a separate payment to the entity that provides blood clotting factor to a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements medicare beneficiary for items and services related to the furnishing of such products 
the amount of this separate payment is capped so that the total of the asp payment rate and the separate payment amount cannot exceed percent of awp 
it is possible that the proposed separate payment amount will be inadequate for the service level requirements of the medicare beneficiary with hemophilia 
while our current census of medicare beneficiary hemophilia patients is quite low  the potential for select state medicaid programs to adopt changes to their payment rates based upon medicare changes exists 
such changes could result in a payment amount that would be inadequate for the required service level 
we are analyzing the impact of these reimbursement changes to our pharmacy segment and plan to address the proposed reductions by altering our business model with changes such as reducing costs  growing revenue through our managed care marketing strategies and looking for additional ways to improve productivity 
there can be no assurance that we will not face increased margin pressures from reimbursement changes 
as previously described in our prior sec filings  georgia medicaid s contractor the contractor missed the original implementation date of october  and delayed the go live date until april  for its new multi health network system mhn 
georgia medicaid is an important customer of ours and represents approximately of our annual billed revenue 
some of the continuing problems we are trying to resolve with georgia medicaid include correcting conflicts between provider numbers  categories of service  membership identification  units of measure  authorized duration of service and corresponding procedure codes within its authorization module 
given the state s apparent unwillingness to agree to a timely settlement on a large number of claims from our rtes segment  we are working with external legal counsel on the range of alternatives available to us including initiating legal action 
given the significance and complexity of these issues  we deemed it necessary to significantly increase our provision for doubtful accounts in the twelve months ended september  as compared to the twelve months ended september  while certain states are realizing relief from prior revenue shortfalls and some are reporting surpluses  concern over a reduction in the future level of federal medical assistance percentages dampens the likelihood that these limitations will be abated at any time in the near future 
in an effort to impact these legislative issues  we have engaged consultants in selected markets to directly present our cost saving strategies and related rate requests to the medicaid programs 
beginning in fiscal  we received a rate increase for our private duty nursing services from two states 
in addition  our local market staff routinely collaborates with the appropriate community and regulatory authorities on our behalf as well as our patients 
as discussed previously under the laws and regulations section above  the hipaa standard transaction in data set rules mandate that covered entities  including our company  transmit claims and certain related healthcare information in standardized formats and data sets 
compliance was required on october   but many payors  including most state medicaid agencies  were not in compliance by that date 
to date  many medicaid agencies are running dual systems to accommodate hipaa compliant transactions as well as non compliant transactions 
some states  however  are running only hipaa compliant systems and other states are not yet hipaa compliant 
there is uncertainty as to when those states using dual systems will discontinue their non hipaa compliant systems 
these uncertainties surrounding claims processing as a result of hipaa s standard transaction and code set rules  which uncertainties are outside our control  have resulted in delayed reimbursement by some payors  including medicaid agencies 
these delays were a contributing factor to the delayed cash collections and resulting increase in allowance for doubtful accounts in the twelve months ended september  we expect that the impact to our cash collections from non hipaa compliant payors should continue to decline in fiscal company events updates during the fourth quarter of fiscal  edward k

during fiscal year  the audit committee received an assessment report of the internal audit function from a national accounting firm 
in subsequent discussions with management  the audit committee approved a plan of reorganization of the internal audit function which incorporates an enterprise approach to risk management 
specific changes included incorporation of clinical  operational  compliance  risk management  financial and the sarbanes oxley act s section test procedures into the audit program 
other recommendations included follow up procedures necessary to resolve issues identified during audits 
risk management we have spent significant time and resources to move towards a fully implemented enterprise risk management model 
this approach to risk management emphasizes assessment of risk from a broader perspective and relies upon significant employee education initiatives and awareness of a variety of risk exposures 
our full time risk manager  who possesses extensive homecare and occupational medicine experience  has strengthened the initial incident reporting and investigation process 
we are beginning to see evidence that these process refinements are positively influencing claim adjustment activities and ultimately  the actuarial estimates of loss history 
our risk committee  which is comprised of members of the compliance  legal  human resources  internal audit and risk management departments  continues to monitor incident reporting and claim adjustment activity  review existing patient census and discharge high risk cases where legally permissible 
our risk committee employs a multi functional approach to its decision making process 
we continue to educate branch office staff on risk management procedures including appropriate nurse staffing decisions 
in addition  our third party actuary analyzes our medical malpractice loss history and quantifies liability recognition under the policy terms 
under our medical malpractice policy  if our loss experience worsens it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and liquidity position 
operations we have three reportable segments i nursing and ppec  ii pharmacy and iii rtes see notes to consolidated financial statements note 
in the nursing and ppec segment  we continue to see pressures on both reimbursement levels and wage rates in key markets 
during fiscal  we experienced a more dramatic reduction in authorized levels of services from key medicaid states  which were partially offset by continued progress in ppec start up operations 
this trend in reduced authorized levels of care for specific patients is a growing obstacle to this segment s future contribution margin expansion 
in order to address this trend  we have expanded our nurse recruiting and retention program to include more local market recruiting staff 
in addition  we have expanded our nurse visit programs in selected markets to respond to specific payor requests and reimbursement agreements 
a renewed focus on same store revenue growth is being undertaken 
this initiative includes improving the alignment and establishing financial incentives for our local market sales and marketing resources to maximize the potential of existing managed care contracts by pulling patient referrals through these relationships 
in the pharmacy segment  we continue to experience a decline in gross margin rates across many of our key product offerings 
for instance  within the hemophilia factor product  clinical changes in a patient s condition can dictate rapid changes to the specific type and amount of drugs provided 
these alternative drugs may have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements relatively higher acquisition costs and lower reimbursement levels based on the payor 
given the expanded  though increasingly concentrated census  changes of this type expose the pharmacy segment revenue and contribution margin to significant volatility 
payor initiated reductions to reimbursement levels with no corresponding reduction to acquisition costs pose a significant threat to future contribution margin levels 
in response to these changing market conditions we have undertaken a series of initiatives including recruiting for a national hemophilia director to coordinate our existing programs and provide dedicated focus on expansion 
in addition  we have increased development of marketing materials which highlight our clinical and service expertise as integral components of our pharmacy programs  as well as exploring potential business relationships with hemophilia treatment centers to manage their patient populations and on going refinement of operational best practices to assure maximized clinical compliance and efficiency 
in the rtes segment  we continue to invest in and expand our sales and marketing program 
we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts upon the higher activity respiratory patients to leverage our clinical competencies and more actively manage the core product mix 
as a result  we have begun to see increases in target referrals from managed care payors in select markets 
however  we have experienced an increased rate of replacement for several equipment items in our core rental fleet 
these increasing capital expenditures reflect growing market acceptance of improved versions of these core products 
many of those items have become smaller and more portable and are increasingly requested by patients and referring physicians 
these items have higher acquisition costs and to date  reimbursement levels have not increased 
in addition  we are experiencing decreased reimbursement for certain disposable and supply items  as well as the elimination of reimbursement for other select items see home healthcare industry events updates above for additional discussion 
in order to address the continued margin pressures on our rtes segment  we have implemented a product review committee to standardize product selections  aggregate product volumes  and source through a reduced number of vendors and maximize purchasing power 
as we seek to fill the vacant divisional vice president position  execution of these initiatives will be critical to achieving the desired objectives 
source availability of clinical personnel during the weeks ending september   our case hours staffed increased to approximately  as compared to  in the weeks ended june  we continue to aggressively compete for nurses to staff hours ordered  retain nurses with select wage and benefit improvements and implement employee satisfaction initiatives 
we have made additional investments in eight new local market nurse recruiters to help reduce unstaffed hours 
we believe that case hours staffed is the most appropriate measurement of nursing activity 
to date  we have seen inconsistent results in a number of markets and will continue to assess and respond accordingly 
we anticipate that over time  our nurse scheduling system  shine  will help to improve both un staffed hours and gross margin levels  however  there can be no assurance that this will occur

index to financial statements critical accounting policies net revenue due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods as additional information becomes available to us 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
as of september   we had no material claims  disputes or unsettled matters with third party payors  nor were there any material pending settlements with third party payors except as disclosed under the recent developments section above 
net revenue represents the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for patient services rendered and products provided 
such net revenue is recognized as the treatment plan is administered to the patient and recorded at amounts estimated to be received under reimbursement arrangements with payors 
net revenues to be reimbursed by contracts with third party payors are recorded at an amount to be realized under these contractual arrangements 
net revenues from medicaid and medicare are generally based on reimbursement of the reasonable direct and indirect costs of providing services to program participants 
in certain situations  the services and products are recorded separately 
in other situations  the services and products are billed and reimbursed on a per diem or contract basis whereby the insurance carrier pays us one combined amount for treatment 
because the reimbursement arrangements in these situations are based on a per diem or contract amount  we do not maintain records that provide a breakdown between the service and product components 
we have developed a methodology to record the estimated net revenue as a result of the inherent time lag between certain patient treatments and input of the related information into our billing and collection system 
this methodology measures relative changes in the time and overall activity level at each branch office location and aggregates these measurements to estimate the impact to consolidated net revenue 
the estimated net revenue from the inherent time lag was approximately  and of net revenue for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
any unforeseen volatility to either the time or activity level at specific branch offices has the potential to significantly impact the estimate 
in other select cases  patient treatments may cease for a number of reasons including re hospitalizations  changes in treatment needs  or death  and a time lag may exist before this information is reflected in our billing and collection system 
we have developed a methodology which measures the historical experience over recent time periods and applies this methodology to reduce net revenues recognized in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the adequacy of the allowance and related provision for doubtful accounts  we have developed a process that combines detailed analysis of historical collections and write off activity with a detailed review of existing account balances meeting certain criteria and their likelihood of being collected at the amounts recorded 
this detailed review involves both the assigned corporate reimbursement department personnel and the respective branch office location personnel assessing each patient claim that falls within prescribed age and amount criteria 
these assessments are aggregated and compared to the results of the detailed analysis of historical collections to provide additional support to management in making the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inherent in this estimate is the risk that it will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to management

eliminated goodwill amortization from the consolidated statements of operations and required an evaluation of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
for these evaluations  we are using an implied fair value approach  which uses a discounted cash flow analysis and other valuation methodologies 
these evaluations use many assumptions and estimates in determining an impairment loss  including certain assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and comparable companies capital structure and earnings power 
for fiscal  we completed the impairment test and  at september   there was no resulting impairment 
subsequent impairments  if any  would be classified as operating expenses 
intangible assets that meet certain criteria qualify for recording on the consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be amortized in the consolidated statements of operations 
such intangible assets will be subject to a periodic impairment test based on estimated fair value 
accrued insurance our insurance broker retains the services of an independent actuary to prepare an actuarial analysis of our development of reported and incurred but not reported claims for workers compensation  medical malpractice and employee benefit plans 
these estimates are updated as determined necessary based on recent claims history and other events 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will need to be revised or updated  with the changes recorded in subsequent periods  as additional information becomes available to us

liquidity and capital resources operations on january   we entered into a credit agreement with general electric capital corporation credit agreement 
subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement  the lender made available a credit facility consisting of a million revolving line of credit and a million line of credit for acquisitions 
availability in both components is subject to a borrowing base calculation against our accounts receivable 
borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the index rate plus 
borrowings under the acquisition line of credit bear interest at libor plus or the index rate plus 
the credit agreement provides for unused line fees of for the revolving line of credit and for the acquisition line of credit 
the credit agreement contains several financial and non financial covenants including  but not limited to  certain leverage  coverage  dso and maximum capital expenditures requirements 
on may   we amended the credit agreement to clarify a definition and increase the maximum capital expenditures covenant 
we have made no borrowings under the credit agreement since its inception 
cash collections as a percentage of net revenue for the three months ended september  and was 
while we anticipate that we will continue to achieve our cash collection targets  there can be no assurance that disruptions to cash flow will not occur 
we continue to experience difficulties in collecting cash from georgia medicaid and non hipaa compliant payors 
see recent developments above 
for the fiscal year ended september   we purchased medical equipment to service existing patients and made routine purchases of computer equipment to maintain and upgrade our technology infrastructure 
we anticipate future capital expenditures for maintenance  support and enhancements of existing technology  continued investments in new start up locations and continued durable medical equipment purchases 
we anticipate funding these capital expenditures with cash flow from operations

this cash requirement is estimated to be million for fiscal and million for fiscal  which is reduced by the monthly loss fund payments 
the net balance at september  and was million and million  respectively 
the insurance carrier has the right to increase this cash requirement at the end of each fiscal year if the claim experience is greater than anticipated  but to date has not indicated the need to do so 
the policy for fiscal will be funded in a similar manner with the cash requirement estimated to be million 
we have secured surety bonds of million to satisfy our workers compensation program requirements for our former insurance carrier 
as of september   the surety bonds were collateralized by million cash posted to a third party escrow account 
during november  we began the renewal process of our employee medical benefit plans 
with the advice and consent of our risk broker  we determined it to be advantageous to continue to use a self insured model instead of a guaranteed minimum premium model 
preliminary claim history for calendar is positive and calendar pricing is within market inflation estimates 
this plan ultimately exposes us to greater risk  although the self insured model s stop loss  aggregate loss and tail liability features provide sufficient protection such that it is more likely than not that we will realize cost savings  as compared to the guaranteed minimum premium model coverage 
in addition  the self insured model carrier s medical and disease management capabilities along with its pharmacy formulary protocols and wellness care programs should enable us to deliver to our employees a more effective and competitive plan 
we recognize that the features of our medical benefit plan are important to the recruiting and retention of clinical and administrative staff and we are committed to offering a plan that is fully competitive with those offered by other home care providers 
as a result of operating in the health care industry  our business entails an inherent risk of lawsuits alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal issues  which can involve large claims and significant defense costs 
from time to time  we are subject to such suits arising in the ordinary course of business 
we currently maintain professional and commercial liability insurance intended to cover such claims 
as of september   this insurance coverage is provided under a claims made policy which provides  subject to the terms and conditions of the policy  coverage for certain types of claims made against us during the term of the policy and does not provide coverage for losses occurring during the terms of the policy for which a claim is made subsequent to the termination of the policy 
should the policy not be renewed or replaced with equivalent insurance  claims based on occurrences during its term but asserted subsequently would be uninsured 
there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of our insurance policy will be adequate 
on october   we completed our annual renewal of our risk management program and implemented several changes 
we renewed our insurance program for medical malpractice  commercial and general liability coverage with arch specialty insurance company  rated a by am best company 
per claim deductible limits remained at million with an aggregate retention of million and an annual aggregate limit of million 
the premiums increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  we are subject to accident claims arising out of the normal operation of our fleet of vans and small trucks  and we maintain insurance intended to cover such claims 
a successful claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have an material adverse effect upon our business 
claims against us  regardless of their merits or eventual outcome  also may have an material adverse effect upon our reputation and business 
we are  from time to time  subject to lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business  some of which may allege damages which would not be covered under our existing insurance policies 
there can be no assurance that settlement of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
capital resources the indenture under which the notes were issued allows us to repurchase the notes at our discretion 
all bids to repurchase have been based upon a number of factors including cash availability  interest rates on

each decision to repurchase the notes has been arrived at independently using the above criteria and we do not have a formal plan in place to repurchase the notes 
we currently believe that our liquidity position will be adequate to satisfy our working capital requirements  professional and commercial liability insurance loss funding  workers compensation collateral requirements  and income tax payments 
our current source of liquidity is cash on hand  cash flow from operations and the credit agreement 
we are exposed to fluctuations in cash collection results 
contingent liabilities and commitments our former workers compensation carrier requires the estimated loss reserve to be secured by surety bonds see liquidity and capital resources 
on october   we completed our annual renewal of our risk management programs and implemented several changes see liquidity and capital resources 
during the quarter ended september   we received a favorable determination from the administrative law judge regarding the medicare audit appeal previously discussed in our prior sec filings 
the settlement reached resolved this matter within our estimated liability of million see note 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain employees which provide  among other things  salary  benefits and perquisites  as well as additional compensation for certain changes in control or a failure to comply with any material terms of the agreements 
we have a non qualified deferred compensation plan for certain of our employees 
the deferred compensation liability as of september  was approximately million 
the following table represents a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations long term debt subordinated notes other notes payable operating leases variation in quarterly operating results our quarterly results may vary significantly depending primarily on factors such as re hospitalizations of patients  seasonality and usage levels of pharmaceutical products and respiratory services  the timing of new branch office openings and pricing pressures due to legislative and regulatory initiatives to contain health care costs 
because of these factors  our operating results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for the full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face a number of market risk exposures including risks related to cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and interest rates 
cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in one financial institution 
we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of this financial institution 
the concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable  which are primarily health care industry related  represent a risk to us given the current environment in the health care industry 
the risk is somewhat limited due to the large number of payors including medicare and medicaid  insurance companies  individuals and the diversity of geographic locations in which we operate 
however  we have substantial geographic density in the eastern united states  which we believe exposes us to payor initiated reimbursement changes 
in addition  we are exposed to risk for a substantial amount of accounts receivable for a small number of hemophilia factor patients and disruptions to cash collections due to the inability of some payors to process claims 
our notes  issued in  have a fixed coupon rate of 
the fair value of our notes is subject to change as a result of changes in market prices or interest rates 
we estimate potential changes in the fair value of interest rate sensitive financial instruments based on the hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
the quantitative information about market risk is necessarily limited because it does not take into account other factors such as our financial performance and credit ratings 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at september  and  the market value of our notes would be reduced by approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the market value of our notes outstanding at september  and of approximately million and million  respectively
