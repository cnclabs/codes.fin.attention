ii off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have material off balance sheet arrangements or related party transactions 
the company is not aware of factors that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity trends  other than the risks discussed in this filing and presented in other company filings 
however  the following additional information is provided to assist financial statement users 
operating leases these leases generally are entered into only for non strategic investments eg  warehouses  office buildings  computer equipment for which the economic profile is favorable 
purchase commitments the company has purchase commitments for materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment as part of the ordinary conduct of business 
such commitments are not in excess of current market prices 
due to the proprietary nature of many of the company s materials and processes  certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination 
the company does not believe a material amount of penalties will be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations 
other contractual obligations the company does not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect liquidity 
related party transactions the company does not have any related party transactions that affect the results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
payments due under contractual obligations the company s future commitments at july  for long term debt  interest expense  operating lease obligations and purchase commitments are as follows dollars in thousands purchase year ending july  long term debt interest expense operating leases commitments total thereafter     total      purchase commitments represent all open purchase orders in the company s sap system as of september  the company believes this is a reasonable estimate of total purchase commitments at july  the company currently has approximately of its consolidated revenues on sap 
inflation and changing prices essentially all of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of its products in competitive markets 
because prices are influenced by market conditions  it is not always possible to fully recover cost increases through pricing 
changes in product mix from year to year and timing differences in instituting price changes and the large amount of part numbers make it virtually impossible to accurately define the impact of inflation on profit margins 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred  there is evidence of an arrangement and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur upon ii shipment of goods to customers 
the vast majority of the company s revenue relates to the sale of inventory to customers  and revenue is recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
given the nature of the company s business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition  the company s revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations 
restructuring restructuring charges relate to the restructuring activities in fiscal  and the company provides forward looking information about the restructuring activities  including estimated costs and savings 
such disclosures represent management s best estimate  but do require significant estimates that may change over time 
however  the specific reserves recorded in each year under the restructuring activities are not considered highly uncertain  as discussed in more detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in
