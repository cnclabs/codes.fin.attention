while these items are important to understand and evaluate financial results  other transactions  events or trends discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis and in the section entitled additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 
a complete understanding of these transactions  as well as the other events and trends explained throughout this report  is necessary to evaluate our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net income was million and million for the quarters ended december  and  respectively  and our net income was million and our net loss was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we have achieved quarterly net income for five consecutive quarters  we expect to incur net losses in subsequent quarters  particularly due to an anticipated increase in sales and marketing expenditures to support the release of our next generation service and a one time software sale we had in that we do not expect to recur 
we also expect that our research and development costs will increase in due to a change in accounting treatment of our software development costs  which will also contribute to net losses in the future 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will increase significantly due to proposed changes in accounting rules and regulations  further contributing to net losses 
the purchase by voyant technologies  inc of a license to our software accounted for of our fourth quarter revenue 
oracle corporation  who represented of our revenue  has indicated its intent to discontinue using our services in the near term 
our five largest customers represented million or of our total revenue 
our ten largest customers represented million or of our total revenue  which indicates a diminishing financial concentration in our next five largest customers 
while our business model is largely usage based  which generally means that our customers only pay for the services they use  our non usage revenue  such as from subscriptions and software licenses  may fluctuate based on the timing of new subscription agreements  the expiration and renewal of existing agreements and the timing of and revenue recognition associated with software licenses 
this fluctuation can significantly impact our financial results  
table of contents particularly revenue  gross margins and net income because these subscriptions and software licenses have virtually no variable cost of revenue expense 
in addition  opportunities to license our software have arisen infrequently and are difficult to predict  and currently we do not anticipate any significant software license revenue beyond as a result  the impact this revenue has on our business and financial results is not consistent and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 
in the quarter ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the quarter ended december  in the year ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the year ended december  we expect our non usage based revenue to approximate to of our total revenue in the first quarter of our next generation service  raindance meeting edition  was recently released in march currently  it is difficult to predict with certainty the impact raindance meeting edition will have on our business  operations or financial results  the market in general and our existing customer base 
on april   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of interact conferencing  llc interact  a nationwide reseller of audio and web conferencing services 
on april   we completed the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we assumed certain liabilities of interact as of april   consisting primarily of accounts payable and a million line of credit 
we also assumed a facility lease obligation of approximately million associated with a building that is partially owned by the former president and chief executive officer of interact who became an officer of our company upon the completion of the acquisition 
effective may   the results of interact s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate purchase consideration paid to interact was approximately million  which was comprised of million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we incurred million in acquisition related expenses 
an additional  shares of our common stock were deemed to represent contingent purchase consideration and accordingly  we recorded million in deferred stock based compensation  which is being expensed over three years  which began in may the value of the common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
the purchase price of million was allocated as follows million was allocated to the net assets acquired and million was allocated to goodwill 
statement of operations overview the following describes how we recognize revenue for the services and software we offered as of december  reservationless conferencing revenue 
revenue for our reservationless conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
for example  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize usage revenue from our reservationless conferencing services in the period the call or simulcast of the call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
web conferencing pro revenue 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from subscription and usage fees in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is either recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements  or recognized ratably over the software support period if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for all undelivered elements 
operator assisted revenue 
revenue for our operator assisted conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone 
in addition  we charge customers a fee for additional services such as call taping  digital replay  participant lists and transcription services 
we recognize usage revenue and related fees from our operator assisted conferencing service in the period the call is completed 

table of contents unlimited conferencing 
revenue from unlimited conferencing is derived from a flat  fixed charge per month depending on the conference size limit selected by the customer 
the fixed monthly charge is recognized as revenue in full each month 
this service provides small and medium sized businesses with a convenient way to conduct audio and web conferences with a predictable price 
conference moderators and participants dial into the conference using their dedicated local exchange toll call number as opposed to a toll free number ordinarily used with our reservationless conferencing service 
this service became available in the first quarter of our cost of revenue consists primarily of telecommunication expenses  depreciation of network and data center equipment  internet access fees and fees paid to network providers for bandwidth  equipment maintenance contract expenses  compensation and benefits for operations personnel and allocated overhead 
our telecommunication expenses are variable and directly correlate to the use of our services and primarily are incurred when our customers use our reservationless conferencing service 
a change in our mix of reservationless conferencing and web conferencing pro or our next generation service revenue will affect our gross profit as our cost of revenue is typically higher on our reservationless conferencing service as a result of price compression for this service 
our depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses  equipment maintenance expenses and compensation expenses generally increase as we increase our capacity and build our infrastructure 
we plan to continue to make investments in our infrastructure and increase our capacity  however  we expect capital expenditures in to be lower than the capital expenditures in due to the investments that we made associated with the release of raindance meeting edition that we do not expect to recur in we expect our cost of revenue to increase in primarily due to an increase in variable costs 
we expect that our current capacity and infrastructure  coupled with the capital expenditures we have made and we expect to make  will accommodate our revenue projections through the end of we have a limited number of sources for our telephony services 
one of our suppliers is worldcom  which currently conducts business under the mci brand name  and which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july if mci was to terminate or interrupt its services  we may experience difficulties or delays in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms and may experience an increase in our variable telephony cost 
we incur sales and marketing expenses that consist primarily of the salaries  commissions and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  remote sales offices expenses  product and market research  sales lead generation and telemarketing expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we expand our sales force and increase our marketing initiatives in to support the release of raindance meeting edition 
we incur research and development expenses that consist primarily of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel  equipment maintenance contract expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred  except for certain capitalized costs associated with internally developed software 
we capitalized million  million  million and million of internally developed software in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
we expect to continue to capitalize costs associated with internally developed software in  however  we expect to see a decrease in capitalized costs in as compared to because we will no longer capitalize costs associated with our next generation service 
based on plans developed in the third quarter of regarding the external distribution of software  we changed the accounting treatment of costs associated with the development of our next generation service from sop to sfas since the second quarter of we had capitalized  pursuant to sop  million in costs associated with our next generation service  million of which was related to internal development and million of which was related to contract development 
we also expect to continue to make investments in research and development and anticipate that these expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in we incur general and administrative expenses that consist primarily of expenses related to finance  human resources  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting and other professional fees  in addition to other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in terms of absolute dollars  however  we expect them to decrease as a percentage of revenue in since our inception  we have used stock based compensation for employees  consultants and members of our board of directors to attract and retain strong business and technical personnel 
during the three months ended december  we did not record any deferred stock based compensation  however  during the year ended december   we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation 
we also expensed million and million related to stock based compensation in the quarter and year ended december   respectively 
the million of the deferred stock based compensation relates to  shares of restricted stock 
table of contents issued in february to certain executives and key employees under our executive performance based compensation arrangement  as approved by the board of directors in february the restricted stock will vest in full on the sixth anniversary of its issuance  subject to accelerated vesting upon the achievement of certain financial or product based performance milestones  or  in the board s discretion  upon a change in control of the company 
accordingly  the million deferred stock based compensation charge is being expensed ratably over six years  which charges will be accelerated when it becomes apparent that the financial or product based milestones will be achieved 
however  the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer effective december  and the resulting cancellation of  shares of restricted stock granted to him under the plan triggered the reversal of the unamortized portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million 
stock based compensation amounts are based on the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale over the option exercise price or stock purchase price 
compensation expense related to stock options is amortized over the vesting period of the options  which generally is four years 
in connection with the acquisition of interact  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation related to the issuance of  shares of common stock simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition  which are being held in escrow and will be released annually in equal one third increments beginning in may accordingly  the deferred stock based compensation related to the  shares is being expensed over three years  which began in may the release of the stock from escrow is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain employment obligations to us by carolyn bradfield  the former president and chief executive officer of interact 
the value of these escrowed shares was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
taking into account the forfeiture upon his termination of  shares of restricted stock issued to our former president and chief executive officer  assuming that no additional shares of the restricted stock granted under our executive performance based compensation arrangement will be forfeited  and taking into account the recording of approximately million of deferred stock based compensation in january associated with the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to our new president and chief executive officer see note to the financial statements  we expect to incur stock based compensation expense of approximately million in  million in  million in  and million each in and  respectively  for common stock issued or stock options awarded to our employees and members of our board of directors under our equity plans through december  plus the restricted stock issued to our president and chief executive officer in january other data non gaap financial measure we evaluate operating performance based on several factors  including our primary internal financial measure of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda 
this analysis eliminates the effects of considerable amounts of depreciation and stock based compensation 
since our initial public offering  we have reported adjusted ebitda  a financial measure that is not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
certain restructuring charges  asset impairment charges and loss on sale of common stock historically presented in this non gaap financial performance measure have been removed from adjusted ebitda for such prior periods to conform to the presentation of adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  the calculation of adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands years ended december  net income loss add depreciation  amortization and other income expense  net add stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda loss the trends depicted by this calculation indicate that we have been successful in reducing our net loss and generating net income as well as increasing adjusted ebitda  primarily as a result of our efforts to control operating costs while simultaneously increasing revenue 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year 
table of contents ended december   our net loss decreased by million  resulting in million in net income for the current year 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our net loss decreased by million  resulting in million in net loss for the year ended december  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   adjusted ebitda increased by million 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   adjusted ebitda increased by million 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful performance metric for our investors and is a measure of operating performance and liquidity that is commonly reported and widely used by financial and industry analysts  investors and other interested parties because it eliminates significant non cash charges to earnings 
in addition  many sophisticated financial institutions and banks use adjusted ebitda as a performance metric in their lending practices 
for example  adjusted ebitda is used by our bank to determine our compliance with a financial covenant articulated in our loan and security agreement 
however  adjusted ebitda as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the funds depicted by adjusted ebitda are not available for our discretionary use due to debt service  debt maturities and other commitments that we have made 
cash flow calculated in accordance with gaap is as follows net cash provided by operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash used by operations was million for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash provided by financing activities was less than million for the year ended december   and net cash used by financing activities was million and net cash provided by financing activities was million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due in part to the addition of new customers and an increase in usage from our existing customer base  which was partially offset by pricing pressure we are experiencing for some of our services  particularly our reservationless conferencing service 
in addition  we first recognized significant revenue from our operator assisted conferencing service in the first quarter of we also recognized million and million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
this license was entered into contemporaneously with our agreement to purchase million in hardware from the licensee  who is also our primary hardware vendor  through december opportunities to license our software have traditionally arisen infrequently and are difficult to predict  thus we do not currently project any significant software licensing revenue beyond total minutes attributable to our usage based services were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  which represents a increase in minutes 
usage based revenue increased by in from  which indicates that our average price per usage based minute declined by approximately or 
cents per minute in we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future  however  we have seen pricing pressure at a reduced rate in the latter months of and early in as compared to early  and therefore have lowered our per usage based minute prices at a reduced rate as compared to the same period during the prior year 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  telecommunications costs increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due to an increase in minutes from our reservationless conferencing and web conferencing pro communication services  partially offset by volume discounts received from our long distance telephony providers  as well as an overall improvement in the utilization of our infrastructure 
total depreciation expense increased million for the year ended december  due to additional hardware and software being placed into service in  partially offset by allocated depreciation due to decreased headcount over the same period in the previous year 
salaries expense decreased million due to decreased headcount in the year ended december  from the year ended december  conversely  expense associated with our operator assisted conferencing service increased million in the current year  which coincides with our growth in revenue from this service 
maintenance and repairs expense increased 
table of contents million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  primarily due to an increase in gross property and equipment 
the primary positive drivers that affect our gross profit are reductions in our long distance rates  a general improvement in our infrastructure utilization  the sale of subscriptions and software licenses with virtually no corresponding variable cost of revenue expense  all of which are or may be partially offset by pricing pressure we are experiencing on the sale of our reservationless conferencing service 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  commissions and bonus expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  in connection with an increase in revenues in the current year 
recruiting expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased headcount over the same period in the previous year 
outside service expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the beta launch of our next generation service in the fourth quarter of offsetting these increases  bad debt expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  due to fewer bankruptcy filings within our customer base  as well as a general improvement in our accounts receivable aging  which resulted in a reduction of our bad debt reserve 
expenses related to telemarketing  lead generation and market research decreased million for the year ended december  from research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  due to increased headcount in connection with the development of our next generation service that took place in  offset by an increase in capitalized internally developed software 
outside services increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  also in connection with the development of our next generation service that took place in there was a slight variance in other expenses  primarily a million increase in repairs and maintenance for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  based on plans developed in the third quarter of regarding the external distribution of software  we changed the accounting treatment of costs associated with the development of our next generation service from sop to sfas as a result  we expect personnel and payroll related expenses and outside services expense to increase in as compared to general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  legal and litigation expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially due to a lawsuit that was filed against us in the third quarter of see note d to the financial statements 
offsetting this increase was a reduction in various expenses  including personnel and payroll related expenses and allocated depreciation expense due to decreased headcount 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  prior to our initial public offering  options and stock purchase rights were granted at less than the estimated initial public offering price resulting in deferred compensation charges  which are being recognized over the applicable vesting periods  which generally are four years 
during the first quarter of we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation that relates to  shares of restricted stock issued to certain executives and key employees in february under our executive performance based compensation arrangement 
the restricted stock grants vest in full on the sixth anniversary of their issuance  subject to accelerated vesting upon the achievement of certain financial or product based performance milestones  or in the board s discretion  upon a change in control of the company 
accordingly  the million deferred stock based compensation charge is being expensed ratably over six years  with such charges being accelerated when it becomes apparent that the financial or product based milestones will be achieved 
however  the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer effective december  and the resulting cancellation of  shares of restricted stock granted to him under the plan triggered the reversal of the unamortized portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million  as none of the acceleration milestones were achieved by this time 
in connection with the acquisition of interact  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation related to the issuance of  shares of common stock simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition  which are being held in escrow and will be released annually in equal one third increments beginning in may accordingly  the deferred stock based compensation related to the  shares is being expensed over 
table of contents three years  which began in may the release of the stock from escrow is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain employment obligations to us by carolyn bradfield  the former president and chief executive officer of interact 
the value of these escrowed shares was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified and removed from service equipment that was no longer required or had become obsolete 
the asset write offs were determined under the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale model 
for a discussion of the methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment charge under this model  see the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates below and the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f we completed the sale and disposal of the assets in in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reversal of  based upon revised estimates of the cash to be received upon complete dissolution and liquidation of evoke communications europe 
severance 
in october our president and chief executive officer entered into a separation agreement to terminate his employment as of december  pursuant to the terms of the separation agreement  we recognized approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to severance costs 
in addition   shares of common stock issued to him in february under the executive performance based compensation arrangement were subject to forfeiture and were cancelled as of december   which triggered the reversal of the deferred portion of his restricted stock grant compensation expense in the amount of million 
in addition  a million cash compensation commitment allocated to our former president and chief executive officer under the executive performance based compensation arrangement was cancelled as of the termination of his employment 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we began an assessment of our cost structure and in december  our board of directors approved a plan of restructuring  which was announced in january in connection with this restructuring  we streamlined our operations to focus on our core web conferencing service offerings 
additionally  in connection with streamlining operations  we refocused our marketing strategy  reduced our workforce and closed several leased office facilities 
in connection with this restructuring we recorded restructuring charges of million and million in the first and second quarter of  respectively 
at december   our restructuring reserves totaled million  of which million is current and solely relates to lease expenses related to the subleased property  which will be relieved as payments are made 
we may be required to record additional restructuring charges in the future if subtenants of these properties default on their commitments to us 
the actual cost savings we anticipated as a result of this restructuring effort have been realized with the exception of the restructuring costs associated with the closure of remote sales facilities 
due to the real estate market that existed  it took us longer than expected to sublease or otherwise terminate our lease obligations in certain cities 
we will continue to monitor and adjust  as warranted  the restructuring reserve associated with remote sales facilities based on current facts and circumstances 
other income  net 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was related to lower interest rates in compared to interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year december  the decrease was due to refinancing our outstanding term loan with a lower interest rate and a decreasing principal balance on which interest is calculated 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers  including the customers we acquired as a result of the acquisition of interact in the second quarter of  and was partially offset by pricing pressure we were experiencing for some of our services  particularly our reservationless conferencing service 
our largest customer  qwest communications  transitioned its use of our reservationless conferencing service to its network in august and this transition decreased our revenue from it for this service as we decreased our price per minute commensurate with our cost of revenue decline 
we also entered into several large web conferencing pro subscription agreements with large telephony carriers in such as qwest 
table of contents and bell canada  which partially explained the increase in non usage based revenue in absolute dollars 
qwest represented of revenue in  despite the transition of reservationless conferencing minutes off of our network 
qwest s percentage of revenue decreased significantly in the first quarter of due to the expiration of a subscription contract for our web conferencing pro service that had been transitioned to a usage based model 
since our restructuring announced in january  we have focused on our core web conferencing service offerings 
accordingly  the second quarter of was the final quarter in which revenue was generated from legacy services as we satisfied commitments made to customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  telecommunications costs increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  this increase resulted from additional telephony charges consistent with increased use of our reservationless conferencing service 
outside services increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is the result of expenses associated with a co location site we established in september to house some of our equipment off site 
maintenance and repairs expense decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the reduction of maintenance costs associated with legacy equipment we took out of service in the second quarter of depreciation expense decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the write down of specific long lived assets to their fair value in the second quarter of the primary reasons for our gross profit improvement were an increase in our subscription based revenue or non usage based revenue  on which we generate higher margins  and a general improvement in our infrastructure utilization 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  expenses related to advertising  promotion and lead generation decreased million for the year ended december  from the same period in in we incurred million in expenses related to our name change that we did not incur in personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   due to increased headcount associated with our acquisition of interact in april allocated depreciation expense increased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december   also due to increased sales and marketing headcount 
bad debt expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  due to fewer bankruptcy filings within our customer base  as well as a general improvement in our accounts receivable aging 
expenses related to outside services decreased million for the year ended december   from the year ended december  additionally  office rent and recruiting expense decreased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  from the same period in in line with our restructuring efforts and stable headcount  exclusive of the interact acquisition 
research and development 
research and development expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december   as a result of an increase in headcount and salaries 
the remainder of the increase for the year ended december  over the year ended december  was due to a million increase in allocated depreciation and a million increase in maintenance and repairs  primarily due to an increase in headcount coupled with a reduction in equipment specifically allocated to cost of revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense remained consistent for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  expenses related to outside services decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we incurred million in royalty expenses pertaining to a contract that was terminated during that quarter 
offsetting these decreases  personnel and payroll related expenses increased million for the year ended december  over the year ended december  additionally  allocated depreciation increased million for the year ended december  over the same period in  whereas legal expenses decreased million for the year december  over the same period in amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december   as result of our acquisition of contigo in june 
table of contents stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  prior to our initial public offering  options and stock purchase rights were granted at less than the estimated initial public offering price resulting in deferred compensation charges  which are being recognized over vesting periods  which generally are four years 
during the years ended december  and december   we recorded million and million  respectively  of deferred stock based compensation 
million of the deferred stock based compensation was recorded in the second quarter of and relates to  shares of common stock issued simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition  which are being held in escrow and are scheduled to be released in equal one third increments and will be expensed over three years  beginning in may additionally  for the years ended december  and december   we reversed million and million of deferred stock based compensation related to the cancellation of unvested stock options 
asset impairment charges 
in the second quarter of  we performed a strategic review of our fixed assets and adopted a plan to dispose of excess equipment 
this review consisted of identifying areas where we had excess capacity and  as a result  excess equipment 
this review was prompted by the slowdown in general economic conditions 
we completed a significant portion of the sale and disposal of the assets in and completed the remainder in the first half of in connection with the plan of disposal  we determined that the carrying values of some of the underlying assets exceeded their fair values  and  as a result  recorded an impairment loss of million in the second quarter of the asset write offs were determined under the held for disposal model 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million in intangible assets primarily related to trademarks associated with our prior name

for a discussion of the methodology used to determine the amount of the impairment charge under this model  see the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates below and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f we completed the sale and disposal of the assets in in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less cost to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of restructuring charge and contract termination expense 
our restructuring activities have included workforce reductions  the sale or disposition of assets  contract cancellations and the closure of several remote sales offices 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in  which consisted of million in severance costs  million in contract termination expenses and a million favorable restructuring reserve adjustment primarily due to the net effect of successfully subleasing several remote offices with terms more favorable than originally anticipated and also consummating an early termination settlement of a software contract 
the contract termination expense relates to terminating a software license agreement 
in connection with the termination  we incurred a charge of million  primarily related to the unamortized cost of the software license 
additionally  as part of the consideration to terminate the license agreement  we returned an investment in the software company s common stock  which resulted in the recognition of an additional realized loss of million on the investment  which is reflected in other income expense 
in  the company recorded restructuring charges of million to record additional charges associated with offices that remained vacant while we continued our attempts to sublease these facilities 
other income expense 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to lower cash balances and lower rates of return on our cash balances in compared to interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as we carried lower debt balances in the current year 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through we experienced an ownership change in as defined in section of the internal revenue code that limited approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to an annual usage per year of approximately million 
the balance of the net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million are not limited by section as of december  the availability of our net operating losses will be affected should we experience another ownership change in the future  as defined in internal revenue code section currently  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our deferred tax asset 
we review our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis for realizability 
while we have generated net income for five consecutive quarters  we believe there currently is not enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets 
when we determine there is enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets  we will reduce the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which will increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
positive evidence to support a conclusion that our deferred tax asset is realizable includes  but is not limited to  generating net income in consecutive quarters and projections for taxable income sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our unrecognized deferred tax assets at december  were million 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our historical unaudited quarterly information for our most recent eight quarters 
this quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements and  we believe  includes all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown

for example  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales 
table of contents patterns  particularly around holidays and the spring and summer months 
we also recognized million and million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
opportunities to license our software have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict and we do not currently have any significant software licensing revenue projected beyond accordingly  our operating results are difficult to predict 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as indications of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  costs and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies in new and rapidly evolving markets  such as the market for web conferencing services 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million held as of december  net cash provided by operations was million and million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used by operations was million for the year ended december  cash provided by operations increased significantly in from as we achieved net income of million in the current year compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the improvement is also due to an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in deferred revenue 
in addition  net cash provided by operations in was favorably impacted by million due to the web conferencing pro license we sold to voyant technologies  inc cash provided by operations increased in from cash used in operations in and we generated positive cash flows from operations in the year ended december  the improvement is due to a significant decrease in our operating loss and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable  a decrease in accounts payable and a decrease in deferred revenue 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment purchases in anticipation of the release of our next generation services and additional conferencing capacity 
net cash used by investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment purchases  as we purchased additional equipment to increase our capacity in conjunction with increases in revenue 
additionally  we paid  net of cash received  million to acquire substantially all of the assets of interact on april  net cash used by investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment upgrades and enhancements 
net cash provided by financing activities was less than million for the year ended december  net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily related to cash proceeds from the exercise of common stock options offset by debt payments 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to debt service payments partially offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the exercise of common stock options and proceeds from our debt financing  net of payments made 
as of december   we had approximately million in total debt obligations outstanding  of which approximately million was current 
effective december   we amended the terms of a loan and security agreement that we originally entered into on october  we renewed and increased the revolving line of credit and refinanced the term loan 
in connection with refinancing the term loan  the current outstanding balance will be repaid with monthly principal payments of approximately million plus interest at over months  with the final payment due in january advances under the revolving line of credit were limited to million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined and adjusted in the agreement 
the revolving line of credit was available through january  advances under the revolving line of credit may have been repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit and the additional liquidity available  based on eligible accounts receivable  was million 
we currently are in the process of renewing our revolving line of credit 
the loan and security agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and is subject to compliance with covenants  including 
table of contents minimum liquidity coverage  minimum quick ratio and maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges 
we are also prohibited from paying any dividends without the bank s prior written consent 
at december   the balance due under this agreement was approximately million  of which approximately million was current 
in addition  in may  we entered into a loan agreement with a vendor  in the amount of million  to finance certain fixed assets 
the loan is scheduled to be repaid with quarterly principal payments of approximately million plus interest at with the final payment due in april at december   the balance due under this agreement was million  of which million was current 
we also receive funds from time to time from the exercise of options or similar rights to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have no other material external sources of liquidity 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations for nine consecutive quarters and we expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations in the near term 
however  such cash flows may be less than the amounts recorded in prior quarters due to an anticipated increase in sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the general availability release of our next generation service which occurred in the first quarter of and an increase in research and development expenses 
looking ahead  we currently expect our debt service payments to remain relatively flat in as compared to and we expect capital expenditures to decrease in as compared to we also expect proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  however  it is not possible to estimate what impact this will have in we obtain a significant portion of our liquidity from operating cash flows 
our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across several industries 
while the purchase of a license to our software by voyant technologies  inc accounted for of our fourth quarter revenue  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenue 
at december   no single customer represented greater than of our total accounts receivable balance 
our five largest customers represented million or of our total revenue and also represented million or of our total december  accounts receivable balance 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows 
in addition  a decrease in their use of our services may adversely impact our future operating results 
for example  oracle corporation  whose purchases accounted for of our revenue in  has indicated its intent to discontinue using our services in the near term 
as of december   our purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and telephony services and equipment were approximately million and will be expended over the next three years 
some of these agreements may be amended to either increase or decrease the minimum commitments during the lives of the respective contracts 
million of our purchase commitments for equipment are pursuant to a single agreement with our primary hardware vendor  and are expected to be expended through december we entered into this hardware agreement contemporaneously with an agreement to license certain software to the hardware vendor for an aggregate of million  which revenue was recognized in the third and fourth quarters of at december   our purchase commitment for equipment was approximately million 
we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through total future minimum lease payments  under all operating leases  as of december   are approximately million 
we have subleased six of these facilities and future minimum sublease receivables for all subleased facilities  as of december   approximate million that we expect to receive through september our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  are as follows in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years over years long term debt facility operating leases  exclusive of sublease receivables purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commitments not included in the contractual commitments schedule above are employment commitments we have made to certain current and former officers of the company 
see note c to the financial statements 
typically  the amount that may be paid and the timing of such a payment are not known with certainty 
at december  our total employment related commitments were approximately million 
we expect that existing cash resources and our new credit facility  which we expect to have in place in the first quarter of  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we base our expenses and expenditures in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than expected  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria  the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates reasonably could have been used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our critical accounting estimates include the accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of depreciable and intangible assets and their recoverability  the assessment of goodwill and its recoverability  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and restructuring charges and reserves 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue for our reservationless conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
for example  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize usage revenue from our reservationless conferencing services as soon as a call or simulcast of a call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from a concurrent user and usage fee in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from concurrent user fees is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either monthly connections or minutes used 
event fees are 
table of contents generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is either recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements or recognized ratably over the software support period if we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for an undelivered element 
in we recognized million in revenue associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
this license was entered into contemporaneously with our agreement to purchase million in hardware from the licensee  who is also our primary hardware vendor  through december opportunities to license our software have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict and we do not currently have any software licensing revenue projected beyond revenue for our operator assisted conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone 
in addition  we charge our customers fees for additional services such as call taping  digital replay  participant lists and transcription services 
we recognize usage revenue and related fees from our operator assisted conferencing service in the period the call is completed 
revenue from unlimited conferencing is derived from a flat  fixed charge per month depending on the conference size limit selected by the customer 
the fixed monthly charge is recognized as revenue in full each month 
this service provides small and medium sized businesses with a convenient way to conduct audio and web conferences with a predictable price 
conference moderators and participants dial into the conference using their dedicated local exchange toll call number as opposed to a toll free number ordinarily used with our reservationless conferencing service 
accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our doubtful accounts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience doubtful accounts at the same rate as we have in the past 
our accounts receivable is currently diverse and is comprised of numerous customers geographically dispersed and dispersed across many different industries 
however  our five largest customers representing million or of total revenue also represented million or of our total december  accounts receivable balance 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables  the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our future operating results 
we cannot predict with certainty future changes in the financial stability of our customers and as such actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate  we will record a credit or charge to sales and marketing expense in the period in which such determination is made 
long lived assets and their recoverability effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas  long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
in  we identified and removed from service equipment that was no longer required or had become obsolete 
the asset write offs were determined under the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale model described above 
we completed the sale and disposal of the assets in in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less costs to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of we did not record any asset impairment losses in 
table of contents goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas which requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas requires a two phase approach for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
in both and  we completed our first phase impairment analysis and did not find indication of impairment of our recorded goodwill  accordingly  the second testing phase was not necessary in each year 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and profitability to determine fair value 
the valuation techniques that we consider include a weighted average multiple of revenue  a weighted average multiple of cash flow  our stock market capitalization and the book value of our assets 
our stock has been and continues to be volatile 
we do not believe market capitalization alone  particularly given the volatility in our stock price  is a good indicator of impairment 
as such  we will continue to monitor the volatility in our stock price and the resulting market capitalization  as well as all of our other impairment indicators  and will continue to assess their collective impact on our recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record charges for impairment of goodwill in the future and there can be no assurances that our goodwill will not be impaired in the future 
in  we recorded million in goodwill as a result of our acquisition of interact conferencing 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill subject to the impairment testing provisions of sfas software development costs costs incurred in the engineering and development of our services is expensed as incurred  except certain software development costs 
costs associated with the development of software to be marketed externally are expensed prior to the establishment of technological feasibility as defined in sfas  accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and capitalized thereafter 
to date  our software development has been completed concurrent with attaining technological feasibility and  accordingly  all software development costs incurred to which sfas is applicable have been charged to operations as incurred 
we capitalize certain qualifying computer software costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the software s estimated useful life 
based on plans developed in the third quarter of regarding the external distribution of software  we changed the accounting treatment for costs associated with the development of our next generation service from sop to sfas accordingly  all software development costs associated with the development of our next generation service are currently being expensed pursuant to sfas since the second quarter of and through august  the period in which capitalization ceased  we had capitalized  pursuant to sop  million in costs associated with our next generation service  million of which was related to internal development and million of which was related to contract development 
we expect to begin amortizing these costs when the service is released for general availability in the first quarter of income tax valuation allowances currently  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our deferred tax asset 
we review our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis for realizability 
while we have generated net income for five consecutive quarters  we believe there currently is not enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets 
when we determine there is enough positive evidence to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will realize some or all of our deferred tax assets  we will reduce the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  which will increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
positive evidence to support a conclusion that our deferred tax assets are realizable includes  but is not limited to  generating net income in consecutive quarters and projections for taxable income sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our unrecognized deferred tax assets at december  were million 

table of contents restructuring reserves at december   our restructuring reserves totaled million  of which million is current and solely relates to lease costs  which will be relieved by payments we make  net of our subtenants rent payments to us 
at december  all closed facilities included in the restructuring reserve have been subleased 
we have adjusted our restructuring reserve in the past based on what we believed to be the most probable outcome 
future minimum sublease receivables for all subleased facilities  as of december   approximate million that are scheduled to be received through september the actual cost savings we anticipated as a result of this restructuring effort have been realized  with the exception of the restructuring costs associated with the closure of remote sales facilities 
due to the real estate market that existed  it took us longer than expected to sublease or otherwise terminate our lease obligations in certain cities 
we will continue to monitor and adjust  as warranted  our restructuring reserve associated with remote sales facilities based on current facts and circumstances 
we may be required to record additional restructuring charges on certain subleased offices if our subtenants default on their commitments to us 
stock based compensation our stock compensation expense is comprised of the following a the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the grant of stock options or shares of restricted stock to employees and board members at exercise or sale prices deemed to be less than fair value of the common stock at grant date  net of forfeitures related to such employees who terminated service while possessing unvested stock options  as these terminated employees have no further service obligations  b the intrinsic value of modified stock options or restricted stock awards  measured at the modification date  for the number of awards that  absent the modification  would have expired unexercisable  c the intrinsic value of restricted stock awards to employees and directors  and d deferred stock based compensation associated with the acquisition of interact conferencing  llc 
we account for our stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price  the intrinsic value method 
under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  entities are permitted to recognize as expense  over the vesting period  the fair value of all stock based awards on the date of grant 
alternatively  sfas also allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion and provide pro forma net income loss disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
we have elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion and provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas all stock based awards to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas and related interpretations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is scheduled to issue an exposure draft on accounting for equity based compensation in the first quarter of and a final statement is expected later in we anticipate the effective date for such a pronouncement will be january  as currently proposed  it would appear that the fair value accounting articulated in sfas will carry forward into the new equity based compensation pronouncement 
there are some practical issues that remain to be addressed such as an appropriate valuation method and the application of multiple assumptions based on an option s exercise price but if these issues are resolved and the statement becomes effective  we can expect to record additional stock based compensation charges in see note l l to the financial statement for the calculation using black scholes 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas on july  and the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should not rely on forward looking statements because they are inherently uncertain

these statements are only predictions 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this document 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described on the following pages and elsewhere in this document 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements included in this document 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language in this document  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this document could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
we have a history of losses and we expect to continue to incur net losses 
our operating costs have exceeded our revenue in each year since our inception in april  except for the fiscal year we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  and we expect to have additional net losses in the future 
we expect to incur net losses in the near term as we expand our sales force  increase marketing expenditures and continue to invest in research and development efforts in connection with the launch of our next generation service 
in addition  our anticipated net losses may increase in the future if existing or future competitors decrease our market share  if price pressure increases significantly  if our next generation services do not achieve widespread market acceptance or if such services reduce our revenue from our existing services and our revenue from web related services does not substantially increase  or if the web conferencing market does not rapidly grow 
if our net losses in the future increase more than we anticipate  we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales and marketing  research and development  or other operating expenses  and as a result  we may be unable to continue our operations as currently planned 
accordingly  we must significantly increase our revenue  which may be difficult for us to do 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history and you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future performance 
we were incorporated in april and first recorded revenue in january we began commercially offering our reservationless conferencing service in april  our web conferencing pro service in june and our operator assisted conferencing service in the first quarter of in january  we restructured our company to focus solely on our web conferencing services 
in connection with this restructuring  we made significant changes to our services and growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters  including a significant reduction in our employee base 
as a result  we have a limited relevant operating history and it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company  and we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the rapidly changing nature of the web conferencing market makes it difficult or impossible for us to predict future results  and you should not expect our future revenue growth to equal or exceed our recent growth rates 
there are a number of factors described in this section that could cause fluctuations in our operating results in any particular period 
if any of these risks are not within our control or we are otherwise unable to address these risks in a cost effective manner or at all  our operating results will be harmed 

table of contents we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  increased competition  the rapidly changing market for our services  price pressure and the other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
for example  our quarterly net income ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended december  our quarterly revenue ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended december  many of the factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results are beyond our control  such as increased competition  pricing pressure and market demand for our services 
our ability to license software may also contribute to such fluctuations  as licensing opportunities have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict  and currently  we do not have any software licensing revenue projected beyond additionally  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
our operating results have shown decreases in our usage based services around the holidays  such as spring  summer  thanksgiving  december and new year holidays 
we expect that our revenue during these seasons will not grow at the same rates as compared to other periods of the year because of decreased use of our services by business customers 
as a result of these factors and other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customers  none of whom are obligated to continue to use our services 
the failure of continued use of our services by existing customers could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customer usage of our services 
our customers are not obligated to continue to use our services as we provide our services largely on a usage based pricing model 
for example  in the quarter ended december   of our revenue was usage based 
in addition  customers have no obligation to renew subscription contracts with us 
as a result  our inability to retain existing customers and sustain or increase their usage of our services could result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis or at all  and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  because many of our customers have no continuing obligations with us  we may face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
our customers depend on the reliability of our services and we may lose a customer if we fail to provide reliable services for even a single communication event 
a significant portion of our revenue is attributable to large customers that have no obligation to continue to use our services 
we target our services to large companies and as a result  we may experience an increase in customer concentration 
for example  our top five customers accounted for and of our revenue in the quarter ended and year ended december   respectively 
these large customers have no obligation to continue to use our services 
for example  oracle corporation is a large customer of ours  representing of our revenue in  and has indicated its intent to discontinue using our services in the near term 
in addition  voyant technologies  inc accounted for of our fourth quarter revenue as a result of purchasing a software license from us  which will not recur 
if any of these large customers stop using our services or are unable to pay their debts as they become due  our operating results will be harmed  our revenue will be negatively impacted  and our anticipated net losses would increase 
we have a receivable due from qwest communications international  inc at december   which was approximately million or of the company s total accounts receivable balance 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a significant portion of our revenue from a non recurring software license 
we recognized million and million in revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  associated with the sale of a web conferencing pro license 
the software license fees associated with this license will not recur 
as a result  our inability to continue to sell software licenses will result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore harm our ability to sustain profitability  and may cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  virtually no corresponding cost of revenue expense is attributable to such licenses  which has the effect of significantly improving our overall gross margins  and if we are unable to continue to sell such licenses  our overall gross margins will decline 
licensing opportunities have traditionally arisen infrequently  are difficult to predict and currently we do not have any significant software licensing revenue projected beyond as a result  our 
table of contents quarterly operating results are difficult to predict 
in addition  by licensing software we have created an opportunity for the licensee to compete against us  which may reduce our market share  harm our competitive position  and create further price pressure 
as a result  our operating and financial performance may be harmed 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase  and if our revenue does not increase  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
we anticipate incurring significant sales and marketing  research and development and other operating expenses  particularly as we continue developing our next generation service and architecture and introduce this new service into the marketplace 
we project expenses in part on our estimates of future revenue 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may be unable to reduce our operating expenses for that period or at all  in which case our operating results would be negatively impacted  and our anticipated net losses may increase 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
the prices for our services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
for example  in the year ended the average price per minute for our reservationless conferencing service decreased by 
in many cases  competitors provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
in addition  telecommunications providers enjoy lower telephony costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunications network 
as a result  these carriers can offer services similar to ours at substantially reduced prices 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we have reduced our pricing in many circumstances and may be required to further reduce our pricing structure in the future  which would negatively affect our revenue  margins and increase our anticipated net losses 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
our growth depends on our ability to develop leading edge web conferencing services and features 
for example  we recently released our next generation web conferencing service and technology in march we may not successfully identify  develop and market this next generation service and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
for example  many companies  including some of our competitors are utilizing less costly resources in china and india to develop their products and services 
as a result  our competitors may be able to develop superior products  services and features more quickly and more cost effectively than we can 
if the services and features we develop fail to achieve widespread market acceptance or fail to generate significant revenue to offset development costs  our anticipated net losses may increase 
in addition  our ability to introduce new services and features may depend on us acquiring technologies or forming relationships with third parties and we may be unable to identify suitable candidates or come to terms acceptable to us for any such acquisition or relationship 
we also may not be able to successfully alter the design of our systems to quickly integrate new technologies 
in addition  we have experienced development delays and cost overruns in our development efforts in the past and we may encounter these problems in the future 
delays and cost overruns could affect our ability to respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards  competitive developments or customer requirements 
our next generation services may impact the revenue we receive from existing services 
our next generation services may negatively impact the revenue we receive for our existing services  particularly our web conferencing pro services 
while we intend to continue to sell our web conferencing pro services in  they are losing market share due to the decline in their quality as a result of the vast majority of our resources being expended on our next generation services 
in the event that we are unable to develop our next generation services in a timely manner  and if such next generation services do not generate significant revenue to offset declining revenue from web conferencing pro services  our financial performance will be affected  particularly revenue and gross margins will decrease and our anticipated net losses will increase 

table of contents competition in the web conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the market for web conferencing services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to further reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
recently  microsoft acquired placeware  a competitor of ours  and cisco systems acquired latitude communications  a competitor of ours 
as a result of these acquisitions  microsoft and cisco may expend significantly greater resources developing and enhancing conferencing services and or software that directly competes with our offerings  and because these companies can leverage widespread use of their product and services by customers to capture market share in the conferencing market  our market share may significantly decline 
in addition  some large software companies  such as oracle and macromedia  are also providing web conferencing products in addition to their software offerings 
these companies may expend significantly greater resources developing  enhancing and marketing their web conferencing products  and as a result  our market share may significantly decline 
in addition  oracle is a large customer of ours and has indicated its intent to discontinue using our services in the near term 
many of our current and potential competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to spread costs across diversified lines of business  and therefore  adopt aggressive strategies  such as reduced pricing structures and large scale marketing campaigns  that reduce our ability to compete effectively 
telecommunication providers  for example  enjoy lower telephony costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunication network 
we expect that many more companies will enter this market and invest significant resources to develop web conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
for example competitors could acquire or partner with companies with which we have distribution relationships and discontinue our partnership  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our services  a competitor could be acquired by or enter into a strategic relationship with a party that has greater resources and experience than we do  such as the microsoft placeware and cisco latitude acquisitions  thereby increasing the ability of the competitor to compete with our services  or a competitor could acquire or partner with one of our key suppliers 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycle varies from several weeks to several months depending on the type and size of customer approached 
oftentimes  potential customers require approvals from multiple decision makers within their organizations 
in addition  since most of our services are provided on a usage based pricing model  it generally takes several weeks or months before our services are ramped for use within an organization 
these variables make it difficult for us to predict if and when our services will be adopted and used by our customers 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict 
our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships or if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services 
for the quarter ended december   of our revenue was attributable to our indirect service customers 
these customers may not be obligated to distribute our services through their sales channels 
in addition  these customers may not be obligated to continue to use our services or renew any subscription agreements with us 
as a result  we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
our inability to retain these customers and sustain or increase their distribution of our services could result in significant reductions in our revenue or we may be required to reduce the price they pay for our services  and therefore  increase our anticipated net losses 

table of contents if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner or if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  our ability to achieve widespread adoption for our services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
establishing these distribution relationships can take several months or more 
additionally  it typically takes several months or longer before our distribution arrangements generate revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of our competitors 
we depend on single source suppliers for key components of our infrastructure and a limited number of sources for telephony services  the loss of which could cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
we purchase substantially all of our key components of our telephony hardware infrastructure from a single supplier 
any extended reduction  interruption or discontinuation in the supply of these components would cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
these components form the basis of our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
in order to continue to expand our infrastructure capacity  we must purchase additional components from this supplier 
in september  we made a commitment to purchase million in hardware from this supplier and accordingly  expect our reliance upon this vendor to continue into the future 
if we were required to find alternative sources for these components  we may experience difficulty in integrating them into our infrastructure and we could be required to expend significant money and resources  which may harm our operating results 
we also have a limited number of sources for our telephony services  which constitute the transport for our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
one of these suppliers on which we are substantially dependent for telephony services is worldcom  which currently conducts business under the mci brand name and which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july if this supplier were to terminate or interrupt its services  we may experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms or in integrating alternative sources into our technology platform 
in addition  if we were required to obtain these services from alternative sources  our cost of sales may substantially increase 
if any of the third party services that we use become unavailable to us  our services would be subject to significant delays and increased costs 
we rely on third party services  such as internet access  transport and long distance providers 
these companies may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions  at the current cost  or at all 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider would be substantial 
we may be required to reengineer our systems and infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider  which would be both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  we have experienced disruptions and delays in our services in the past due to service disruptions from these providers 
any interruption in the delivery of our services would likely cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 
our transition to voip technology is subject to significant risks  delays and costs 
we recently announced that we will be transitioning some of our long distance telephony traffic onto a voip platform 
as a result of this change  we become subject to significant risks  delays and costs 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider are substantial 
for example  we have reengineered our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our new service provider  and expect to continue to do so  which is both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  we have experienced disruptions and delays in our services in the past due to the transition to a new service provider 
there also may be unforeseen circumstances as a result of this transition that may cause delays in transitioning our long distance telephony traffic 
as a result of these delays our anticipated net losses may increase 
any interruption in the delivery of our services may cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 
our business will suffer if our systems fail or become unavailable 
a reduction in the performance  reliability or availability of our systems will harm our ability to provide our services to our users  as well as harm our reputation 
some of our customers have experienced interruptions in our services in the past due to service or network outages  periodic system upgrades and internal system failures 
similar interruptions may occur from time to time in the future 
because our revenue depends largely on the number of users 
table of contents and the amount of minutes consumed by users  our business will suffer if we experience frequent or extended system interruptions 
we maintain our primary data facility and hosting servers at our headquarters in louisville  colorado  and a secondary data facility in denver  colorado 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these facilities and our systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  water  telecommunications failure  vandalism  sabotage and similar unexpected events 
in addition  a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our systems or infrastructure could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and systems that we use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause service interruptions and  as a result  materially harm our reputation  negatively affect our revenue  and increase our anticipated net losses 
our services are often used to share confidential and sensitive information and  as a result  if our security system is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
we must securely receive and transmit confidential information for our customers over public networks and maintain that information on internal systems 
our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation  and expose us to risk of loss or liability 
if we fail to provide adequate security measures to protect the confidential information of our customers  our customers may refrain from using our services or potential customers may not choose to use our services  and as a result  our operating results would be harmed 
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
in addition  our internal systems are accessible to a number of our employees 
although each of these employees is subject to a confidentiality agreement  we may be unable to prevent the misappropriation of this information 
if we do not increase the capacity of our infrastructure in excess of customer demand  customers may experience service problems and choose not to use our services 
the amount of conferencing events we host has increased significantly 
we must continually increase our capacity consistent with our growth in usage 
we generally maintain between and capacity based on average usage 
to accommodate increased customer usage and rapidly expand our operations requires a significant increase in the capacity of our infrastructure 
to increase capacity  we may need to order equipment with substantial development and manufacturing lead times  which can sometimes be several months or longer 
if we fail to increase our capacity in a timely and efficient manner  customers may experience service problems  such as busy signals  improperly routed conferences  and interruptions in service 
service problems such as these would harm our reputation  cause us to lose customers and decrease our revenue  and therefore our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis or at all 
conversely  if we overestimate our capacity needs  we will pay for more capacity than we actually use  resulting in increased costs without a corresponding increase in revenue  which would harm our operating results 
our failure to manage growth could cause substantial increases in our operating costs and harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis or at all and  therefore  decrease the value of our stock 
despite our restructuring in january  which resulted in  among other things  a significant reduction in the size of our workforce  we have rapidly expanded since inception  and will continue to expand our operations and infrastructure 
this expansion has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may not effectively manage this growth 
rapidly expanding our business would require us to invest significant amounts of capital in our operations and resources  which would substantially increase our operating costs 
as a result  our failure to manage our growth effectively could cause substantial increases in our operating costs without corresponding increases in our revenue  thereby increasing our anticipated net losses 
also  our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing growth 
in order to rapidly expand our business we may need to raise additional funds 
any future financing we require may not be available on a timely basis  in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to compete effectively 

table of contents our joint venture with viso limited was not successful and any future plans for international expansion may not be successful  which could harm our ability to attract multi national customers and adversely affect our operating results 
we have attempted to expand into international markets and spent significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  we formed a joint venture with viso limited  a european based venture capital firm  to expand our operations to continental europe and the united kingdom 
currently  this joint venture is in the process of being liquidated and will be dissolved 
this decision may harm our strategy to expand internationally and attract multi national customers 
further  we will not realize the value from the costs associated with starting up this venture 
if we expand internationally  either alone or with a partner  we would be required to spend additional financial and managerial resources that may be significant 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as difficulties in establishing and maintaining distribution channels and partners for our services  varying technology standards from country to country  uncertain protection of intellectual property rights  inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  linguistic and cultural differences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  imposition of currency exchange controls  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  our expansion into international markets may require us to develop specific technology that will allow our current systems to work with international telephony systems 
we may not develop this technology in a timely manner  in a way to prevent service disruptions or at all 
we are not experienced in managing facilities  people and operations in geographically diverse areas  which we now are required to do as a result of the acquisition of interact conferencing  llc 
as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of interact  we have operations in multiple facilities in geographically diverse areas 
in particular  we have transitioned the management of the sales force to the former chief executive officer of interact  located in our georgia facility 
we are not experienced in managing facilities  people and operations in geographically diverse areas  and as a result  this dispersion may negatively impact our operating results 
we may acquire other businesses  form joint ventures and make investments in other companies that could negatively affect our operations and financial results and dilute existing stockholders 
we may pursue additional business relationships through acquisitions  joint ventures  or other investment prospects  which may not be successful  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition  joint venture  or other investment 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions 
there may also be risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
further  these potential acquisitions  joint ventures and investments entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  
table of contents technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
there may also be unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition that may harm our operating results and key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these risks could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if we were to make any acquisitions  we could  for example issue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders  expend cash  incur debt  assume unknown or contingent liabilities  and experience negative effects on our results of operations 
our reservationless conferencing service may become subject to traditional telecommunications carrier regulation by federal and state authorities  which would increase the cost of providing our services and may subject us to penalties 
we believe our reservationless conferencing service is not subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc or any state public service commission because the services integrate traditional voice teleconferencing and added value internet services 
the fcc and state public service commissions  however  may require us to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for our reservationless conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as a provider of telecommunications services 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against us  we could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of our reservationless conferencing service until we have obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
we believe we would be able to obtain those licenses  although in some states  doing so could significantly delay our ability to provide services 
we also would be required to comply with other aspects of federal and state laws and regulations 
subjecting our reservationless conferencing service to these laws and regulations would increase our operating costs  could require restructuring of those services to charge separately for the voice and internet components  and would involve on going reporting and other compliance obligations 
we also might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
our competitors may be able to create systems with similar functionality to ours and third parties may obtain unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
the success of our business is substantially dependent on the proprietary systems that we have developed 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we currently rely on a combination of trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights  and confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions 
we also own five patents relating to features of our web conferencing pro service 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our web conferencing services and other intellectual property 
unauthorized third parties may copy or infringe upon aspects of our technology  services or other intellectual property 
other than the patents that we own  our proprietary systems are not currently protected by any patents and we may not be successful in our efforts to secure patents for our proprietary systems 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors and others may be able to develop similar systems and services without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our proprietary systems and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property and we may not have any adequate remedies 
furthermore  the validity  enforceability and scope of protection for intellectual property such as ours in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
in addition  our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  and as a result  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis or at all 
additionally  in any litigation the outcome is uncertain 

table of contents we have been sued for patent infringement and may be subject to additional claims alleging intellectual property infringement 
in august  a lawsuit was filed by edisync systems  llc against us and some of our competitors alleging patent infringement 
in december  we entered into a definitive settlement agreement with the plaintiff  for which we previously had accrued million in the third quarter of in addition  we may be subject to other claims alleging intellectual property infringement 
claims of this nature could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves  regardless of their merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  divert management attention and resources  or halt or delay distribution of our services while we reengineer them or seek licenses to necessary intellectual property  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as the number of competitors in our market grows  there is an increased risk that the proprietary systems and software upon which our services rely may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims 
our business may be harmed if our services do not work with the various hardware and software systems  including corporate security measures  used by our customers 
we currently provide services to customers with various hardware and software systems  ranging from legacy to next generation applications and networking equipment 
if our services are unable to support these diverse platforms  and if we fail to modify our services to support new versions of these applications and equipment  our services may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
furthermore  because of bandwidth constraints on corporate intranets and concerns about security  our customers and potential customers may block reception of web services like ours within their corporate environments 
in order for customers to use our services  customers and users may need to reconfigure their corporate intranets  security measures and firewalls 
widespread adoption of our technology and services depends on overcoming these obstacles 
our current stock compensation expense negatively impacts our earnings  and if we are required to report the fair value of employee stock options as an expense in conjunction with new accounting standards  our earnings will be adversely affected  which may cause our stock price to decline 
under our current accounting practice  stock compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
as of december  we had approximately million in deferred equity based compensation expense 
we expect this expense to be amortized over six years and to negatively impact our earnings during that time 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of deferred stock based compensation in january associated with the issuance of  shares of restricted stock to our new president and chief executive officer 
million of this deferred equity based compensation will be recognized as an expense over the next year as options granted prior to our initial public offering and certain restricted stock grants vest 
options granted to consultants will fluctuate with our stock price  and as a result  the amount of future stock compensation expense related to any unvested portion of such options is difficult to predict 
regulatory authorities are currently reviewing various proposals that would change the way stock options are reported 
if we are required to report all employee stock options as an expense based on a change in accounting standards  our earnings will be negatively impacted  which may cause our stock price to decline and our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis or at all could be harmed 
we disclose non gaap financial information 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this non gaap financial information excludes certain non cash expenses  consisting primarily of depreciation  the amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we believe the disclosure of non gaap financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare the gaap financial information with the non gaap financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 

table of contents we are subject to risks associated with governmental regulation and legal uncertainties 
it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and other countries with respect to the internet that might affect us 
these laws may relate to areas such as changes in telecommunications regulations  copyright and other intellectual property rights  encryption  personal privacy concerns  including the use of cookies and individual user information  e commerce liability  and email  network and information security 
changes in telecommunications regulations could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet 
this  in turn  could slow the growth in internet use and thereby decrease the demand for our services 
several telecommunications carriers are advocating that the federal communications commission regulate the internet in the same manner as other telecommunications services by imposing access fees on internet service providers 
recent events suggest that the fcc may begin regulating the internet in such a way 
in addition  we operate our services throughout the united states and state regulatory authorities may seek to regulate aspects of our services as telecommunication activities 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulations than those that have been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our services  and may affect the growth of the internet 
such laws or regulations may therefore harm our business 
we may be subject to assessment of sales and other taxes for the sale of our services  license of technology or provision of services  for which we have not accounted 
we may have to pay past sales or other taxes that we have not collected from our customers 
we do not currently collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services 
our business would be harmed if one or more states or any foreign country were to require us to collect sales or other taxes from current or past sales of services  particularly because we would be unable to go back to customers to collect sales taxes for past sales and may have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 
our stock price is volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price  result in litigation or indicate that our goodwill is impaired  resulting in further declines to our stock price 
the stock market in general  and the stock price of our company in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
for example  between january  and december  our stock has traded as high as and as low as on the nasdaq national market 
the volatility of our stock price can be due to factors such as  fluctuating operating results  significant purchases and sales of our stock  announcements by us or our competitors  changes in security analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  broad market and industry factors may negatively impact our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
many companies that have experienced volatility in their stock prices have been targets for securities class action litigation 
if we were subject to any such litigation  we could be required to expend substantial costs and resources  which could harm our business 
additionally  one of the factors that we consider in determining a potential impairment of our goodwill is our stock market capitalization 
if our stock price declines and remains depressed for an extended period of time  our reported goodwill could be materially adversely impaired which would require us to write down our goodwill  and this charge may cause our stock price to decline further 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had long term debt  including current portion  in the aggregate amount of million 
the balance due of approximately million as of december  under our loan and security agreement is being repaid at a fixed interest rate of with monthly payments due through january the balance due of approximately million as of december  under our loan agreement with a vendor will be repaid at a fixed interest rate of with quarterly payments due through april a change in interest rates would not affect our obligations related to long term debt existing as of december   as the interest rates related to such debt are fixed over the terms 
at december   we had a million revolving line of credit with a loan value of million 
advances under the revolving line of credit would have reflected interest at the bank s prime rate and therefore any advances under this revolving line of credit would have subjected us to interest rate fluctuations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  including any advances on our revolving line of credit 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance under the revolving line of credit 
on january  our revolving line of credit matured and we are currently in the process of renewing this credit facility 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks through a receivable from our european joint venture which is payable in euros 
we do not employ any risk mitigation techniques with respect to this advance 
our european joint venture is in the process of dissolution and liquidation and our foreign currency risk with respect to the loan will be eliminated when these processes are completed  which we expect to occur in the second quarter of we may also decide to make future investments that will subject us to market risk
