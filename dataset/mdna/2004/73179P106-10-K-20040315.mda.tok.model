item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview polyone corporation is an international polymer services company with continuing operations in thermoplastic compounds  specialty polymer formulations  color and additive systems  and thermoplastic resin distribution 
headquartered in avon lake  ohio  polyone has employees at manufacturing sites in north america  europe and asia  and joint ventures in north america  south america and asia 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link polymer technology and formulation with our manufacturing and supply chain processes 
for the fiscal year ended december   we had sales of billion  approximately of which were from markets outside of north america 
polyone corporation discontinued operations as of december   polyone s elastomers performance additives  specialty resins and engineered films businesses qualified for accounting treatment as discontinued operations 
these three business operations are expected to be sold in as a result  all historical financial information of these businesses revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities  and cash flows has been reported separately as discontinued operations 
elastomers performance additives was previously reported as a separate business segment 
specialty resins and engineered films were previously included in polyone s performance plastics business segment 
in december  polyone sold its interest in softer  an italian compounder of thermoplastic materials 
as a result  all historical financial information of this business revenues  costs and expenses  assets and liabilities  and cash flows has been reported separately as a discontinued operation 
softer was previously included in polyone s performance plastics business segment 
the following table summarizes the results for the businesses reported as discontinued operations in millions sales elastomers performance additives specialty resins and engineered films softer pre tax income loss from operations elastomers performance additives specialty resins and engineered films softer pre tax loss on disposition of businesses elastomers performance additives specialty resins and engineered films softer income tax expense net of valuation allowance income loss from discontinued operations in restating the operating results of the discontinued operations  estimated indirect costs previously allocated to the elastomers performance additives  specialty resins and engineered films business operations that are expected to be retained upon disposal of these businesses have now been included in the continuing businesses operating results 
these costs  totaling million in  million in and million in  have been allocated to the continuing business segments as follows performance plastics  distribution and other 
for more information regarding discontinued operations  see note b to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  restructuring and consolidation activities since our formation in august  we have implemented several restructuring initiatives to streamline our manufacturing processes and reduce our overhead costs 
as a result of such initiatives  we have incurred various employee separation and plant phaseout costs 
these costs include severance  employee outplacement  external consulting  lease termination  facility closing and the writedown of the carrying value of plants and equipment 
during  employee separation and plant phaseout charges of million were recorded 
of the expense  million related to a january announcement to reduce approximately staff personnel 
the costs were for employee separation  which consisted of severance and other employee benefits 
in june  the decision was made to close the fort worth  texas color additives plant  for which an expense of million was recorded 
during  polyone adjusted its estimate for the remaining liabilities associated with restructuring initiatives announced in prior years 
as a result of the adjustment  net reserves of million were reversed and included in employee separation and plant phase out on the consolidated statements of operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of  polyone closed two leased ohio administrative offices  closed a portion of the mexico distribution business  reduced manufacturing personnel in the north american plastics businesses and reduced additional administrative positions in north america 
the impact of these closures and reductions was to reduce operating income by million and terminate approximately employees 
approximately employees remain to be terminated in association with all restructuring initiatives announced in see note s to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  for the breakdown of these charges by segment for continuing operations 
polyone corporation during  employee separation and plant phaseout charges of million were recorded for costs associated with the consolidation of certain activities related to the formulator operations in the performance plastics segment 
the costs were for employee separation  which consisted of severance and other employee benefits 
all employees were terminated in during  operating income for the performance plastics segment was reduced by charges of million for costs associated with integration efforts and programs to update north american manufacturing 
the costs included million for employee separation  million for cash plant closing and million to write down the carrying value of plant and equipment 
employee separation consisted of severance and other related employee benefits  and included the projected termination of approximately employees 
status of pension plans our pension plans were generally under funded at december  and at december   polyone had a minimum pension adjustment  net of tax  of million 
this balance will decrease in future periods if interest rates increase  investment results improve  or contributions cause the pension plans to return to fully funded status 
as a result of the under funded status of the pension plans at year end and a reduction in the discount rate  non cash pension expense is estimated to be approximately million pre tax higher in than in for  total non cash pension expense is expected to be approximately million pre tax 
outlook we anticipate improved market conditions in compared to us industrial production is projected to increase approximately versus as contrasted with the generally flat level seen in versus housing starts are projected to remain strong at million units  although down about from north american automobile and light truck build rates are projected to increase moderately to million units  but build rates at the big three domestic manufacturers are projected to decline to 
as the economy recovers  we expect that the loss of north american business to asia will become more evident and continue to be a factor 
our view is that plastics growth in north america will trend in the to level in  whereas in the late s the expectations were in the range of to per year 
europe is currently witnessing a similar strengthening and projections are for industry growth rates recovering to versus less than in asian business has largely recovered from the market activity dampening sars issues and is projecting industrial growth of to in compared to plastics annual growth in china is expected to average to for the next five years 
the improvement we anticipate in market conditions is expected to be sequential by quarter  continuing the market strengthening trend we saw from august through october  which provides a degree of optimism for positive momentum entering fourth quarter shipment volumes increased over the fourth quarter of in the performance plastics business segment and in the distribution business segment  with growth in distribution shipment volumes in the united states and canada 
after a normal seasonal year end slowdown  demand in january returned to september and october levels for most businesses and geographic regions 
price trends for key raw materials are mixed 
energy and derivative hydrocarbon feedstock pricing is expected to moderate compared to chlorine and pvc resin  however  are projected to increase modestly  pressuring margins on our downstream vinyl compounding businesses 
resin and intermediates  on the other hand  is expected to benefit from these trends and earnings are expected to increase in this business segment 
further pressure on vinyl compound margins is anticipated as a result of additional domestic production capacity 
we also anticipate upward pressure on non resin raw materials as market conditions improve 
this resulting pressure on margins is expected to be offset by the full year impact of cost reduction and restructuring initiatives  new initiatives in to continue simplifying processes and eliminating non value added work and ongoing raw material savings programs 
management actions in will also be focused on strengthening our market positions 
we are targeting market share gains by helping customers be more competitive on a global basis through an expanded international presence and by commercializing new technologies

employee separation and plant phaseout we recorded costs for severance  employee outplacement  external outplacement consulting  facility closing costs and the write down of the carrying value of plants and equipment related to restructuring initiatives in each of the last three years 
these costs are discussed in detail above and in notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  period plant phaseout costs incurred these are plant phaseout costs associated with the geon restructuring initiatives that were recognized as period costs versus when the restructuring initiative was approved 
in connection with the acquisition of hanna and resulting formation of polyone  management developed several initiatives to capture the strategic value of the combined former geon and former hanna businesses 
this resulted in several announcements in that former geon plants and hanna plants would be closed 
the initiatives also included the termination of corporate and other positions at former geon and hanna locations 
the charge is for the write off of inventory and receivables as a result of the decision to exit a portion of the mexico distribution business 
merger and integration costs these costs primarily represented executive separation costs for two key former geon executives incurred as a result of the change in control associated with the formation of polyone 
asset impairments and loss on divestiture of equity investment a non cash impairment charge was recorded to adjust the year end carrying value of deferred product technology  customer list  note receivable and internet investments to their estimated realizable future cash flows

business segment information senior management uses segment operating income  which excludes special items  to assess performance and allocate resources to business segments 
the following table reconciles operating income loss to segment operating income loss 
senior management uses segment operating income when evaluating the results of operations of the business segments because senior management believes this measure is useful in understanding current profitability levels and how current levels may serve as a base for future performance 
in addition  segment operating income is a component of the polyone annual incentive plan at the corporate and business segment levels 
segment operating income may not be comparable to financial performance measures presented by other companies 
special items include charges related to specific strategic initiatives such as the consolidation of operations  restructuring activities such as employee separation costs resulting from personnel reduction programs  plant closure and phase out costs  merger and integration costs  asset impairments and gains and losses on the divestiture of joint ventures and equity investments

change vs 
north american plastic compounds and colors vinyl compounds colors and additives engineered materials subtotal international plastics compound and colors formulators total performance plastics north american vinyl compounds volume decline was the result primarily of slower demand in the wire and cable  custom profile and packaging markets 
higher average selling prices  which were the result of efforts to recapture raw material cost increases  helped to offset the volume decline  bringing sales to polyone corporation slightly above levels 
although colors and additives volumes were flat compared to the prior year  sales were lower as a result of a shift in product mix towards more general purpose products 
engineered materials volumes and sales were down from lower demand in automotive end market applications combined with a key customer taking its compounding production back in house 
international plastic compounds and colors volumes were up due to the transcolor acquisition and stronger demand in asia 
favorable currency exchange rates increased sales by million and the transcolor acquisition added million in sales 
formulators volume and sales declines were the result of the contribution of the former urethanes product line to the bayone equity joint venture formed in june for which polyone no longer separately reports sales  combined with a key customer having lost share in its end market 
performance plastic s segment operating income was million in  an increase of million from even though volume was down by from  favorable currency translation added approximately million to earnings 
this was partially offset by higher raw material costs that were not fully recovered by higher selling prices 
margin compression was the most severe in the north american vinyl compounds product group  particularly in the first half of also contributing to improved segment earnings were lower costs as a result of manufacturing  selling and administrative restructuring initiatives 
distribution had sales of million  an increase of million  or from shipment volumes declined by from sales were up in the united states and canada due to stronger demand for engineering resins and polyone produced vinyl compounds 
mexico sales and volumes were down by approximately due to a decision to exit a portion of the business and export from the united states 
distribution s segment operating income was million in  an increase of million from due to increased sales and cost savings from the closure of a significant portion of the mexico distribution operation 
resin and intermediates operating income was million  an increase of million from the improvement resulted from higher sunbelt earnings of million that were partially offset by lower oxyvinyls earnings of million 
for versus  the average industry selling price for chlorine increased by approximately per ton and caustic soda increased by approximately per ton 
oxyvinyls earnings decreased in from primarily due to higher average natural gas costs of approximately per million btu  largely offset by higher chlor alkali earnings driven by the higher industry average selling prices of chlorine and caustic soda 
average industry spreads of pvc selling prices over ethylene and chlorine costs were marginally higher 
other consisted primarily of corporate governance costs that are not allocated to business segments and inter segment sales and profit eliminations

north american plastic compounds and colors vinyl compounds colors and additives engineered materials subtotal international plastics compound and colors formulators total performance plastics the decline in total performance plastics sales was the result of lower sales in north american plastic compounds and colors  partially offset by strong demand in asia and a favorable euro currency exchange impact  which increased us dollar reported sales by million 
north american plastic compounds and colors experienced softer demand in nearly all markets for vinyl  in addition to lower average selling prices compared to vinyl compound volumes declined while sales revenue declined during  with the most notable decline in wire and cable applications 
colors and additives volumes declined and sales revenues declined  while engineered materials volumes improved and sales revenues improved 
contributing to lower sales in north american plastic compounds and colors was some loss in market share in the north american color and additive concentrate and vinyl compound markets that resulted from competitors taking business at lower selling prices for which we chose not to compete  combined with some customers taking the production of these products in house 
performance plastic s segment operating income was million in  a decrease of million from  reflecting lower segment sales and lower vinyl compound margins  partially offset by the positive impact of cost reduction programs and restructuring initiatives  which included closing seven production facilities within the performance plastics business segment 
distribution had sales of million  an increase of million  or  from the improvement in sales resulted largely from using our distribution business segment for smaller volume sales of polyone vinyl compounds instead of using a third party distributor 
distribution s segment operating income was million in  an increase of million from due to increased sales volumes and improved selling price spreads over material costs 
in  the distribution segment began representing polyone s vinyl compounds in the market place 
resin and intermediates operating income was million  an increase of million from this improvement was primarily the result of higher oxyvinyls earnings of million 
average industry pvc resin market selling prices were approximately per pound higher in compared to  with the average industry resin spread over raw material costs increasing by a similar amount as lower ethylene costs offset higher chlorine costs 
in addition  oxyvinyls earnings were reduced by lower average industry caustic soda selling prices of approximately per ton  while lower average natural gas costs of approximately per million btu added to earnings 
other consisted primarily of corporate governance costs that are not allocated to business segments and inter segment sales and profit eliminations 
the loss in was million compared with a loss of million in accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires polyone s management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
polyone evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare financial statements on an ongoing basis 
polyone bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under certain facts and circumstances 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements related to the accounting policies and estimates described in the text that follows 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
for additional information regarding our accounting policies  see note c to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  environmental accrued liability polyone has accrued million to cover future environmental remediation expenditures  and believes that none of these matters  either in polyone corporation dividually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
the accrual represents polyone s best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs  net of estimated insurance recoveries  based upon information and technology currently available 
polyone s estimate of the liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
for additional information regarding the environmental accrued liability  see note o to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  restructuring accruals polyone has recorded accruals in connection with restructuring its businesses  as well as the integration of acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs  the closure and or consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations and the valuation of certain assets including property  plant and equipment  and inventories 
actual amounts could differ from the original estimates 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to the initial plans are appropriately recognized when identified 
changes to plans associated with the restructuring of existing businesses are generally recognized as employee separation and plant phaseout costs in the period the change occurs 
under eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  changes to plans associated with the integration of an acquired business are recognized as an adjustment to the acquired business original purchase price goodwill if recorded within one year of the acquisition 
after one year  a reduction of goodwill is recorded if the actual costs incurred are less than the original reserve 
more than one year subsequent to an acquisition  if the actual costs incurred exceed the original reserve  the excess is recognized as an employee separation and plant phaseout cost 
in january  polyone refined the original plan and decided to continue operating one facility 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  the related reserve of approximately million associated with this facility  which related to an acquired business  was reversed and recognized as a reduction to goodwill of the acquired business 
also  during  polyone adjusted its estimate of the remaining liabilities associated with the consolidation of geon and hanna 
as a result of the adjustment  net expense of million was recorded and included in employee separation and plant phase out on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   polyone had an accrued liability of million for future estimated employee severance and plant closing costs 
this liability related to remaining expected expenditures resulting from current year and prior year restructuring initiatives 
during  the liability was increased by million  of which million related to discontinued operations and was reported as a component of the total loss from discontinued operations 
the liabilities for employee separation and plant phaseout for the businesses reported as discontinued operations will be retained by polyone upon the sale of these businesses 
for additional discussion  refer to notes e and f to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  equity investment in december  oxyvinyls  of which polyone owns a interest  announced the temporary idling of its deer park  texas  chlor alkali plant due to low industry capacity utilization and low product market selling prices 
as of december   oxyvinyls had accrued million for future employee severance and liabilities associated with the temporary idling of the deer park plant 
in  oxyvinyls recognized an additional million of expense associated with the temporary plant idling  plus an additional expense of million in the third quarter related to the permanent closing of specific production assets included in the idled plant 
the permanent closing costs included million for the impairment of the fixed assets as well as million for decommissioning costs 
as of december   oxyvinyls had fully utilized the accrual for future employee severance liabilities and decommissioning costs 
the plant had a net property carrying value by oxyvinyls at the end of of approximately million  which is anticipated to be realized through future operations upon restarting the plant 
oxyvinyls will maintain the deer park chlor alkali plant in a standby mode pending further strengthening in overall economic conditions and improved demand for caustic soda resulting in improved margins 
goodwill as of december   polyone had million of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of businesses 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  under which goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested for impairment annually polyone has selected july  or more often  if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have occurred 
in making goodwill impairment assessments  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the polyone corporation carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recognized 
polyone uses the combination of two valuation methodologies  a market approach and an income approach  to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
absent fair value from a potential buyer or similar specific transactions  we believe the use of the two methodologies provides reasonable estimates of a reporting unit s fair value 
a reporting unit s fair value computed by these two methodologies is derived using a number of factors such as projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  marketplace data of comparable companies or near comparable companies from within a consistent industry grouping  and cost of capital 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to management s judgment when applied to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
accordingly  management believes the combination of these methodologies provides a reasonable approach by which to estimate the fair value of its reporting units 
no assumptions or estimates differed between the two methodologies as of any valuation date for each reporting unit 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar investment characteristics of the reporting unit to the reporting unit s operating performance adjusted for non recurring items 
management believes the use of this approach is appropriate because as it provides a fair value estimate using multiples from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units 
the key estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value under the market approach include a the use of projected future results and b a control premium applied to the market multiples to adjust the enterprise value upward for a ownership interest 
projected future results for the next twelve months are utilized due to the forward looking nature of the market related multiples 
projected future results are based upon management s estimates  which take into account projected economic and market conditions and the reporting unit s business plans 
the income approach is based on projected future debt free cash flow that is discounted to present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the forecasted debt free cash flow 
management believes the use of this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting unit s expected long term operating performance 
this approach also mitigates most of the impact of cyclical downturns that occur in the reporting unit s industry 
the income approach is based on a reporting unit s five to ten year projection of operating results and cash flows and is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital calculated for the reporting unit s industry 
the projection is based upon management s estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the five to ten year period including growth rates  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions used for the debt free cash flow model include terminal value growth rates  terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements based on projected management plans 
we determined that goodwill was not impaired as of the annual assessment performed as of july  or the interim assessment performed as of december  however  the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment  such as a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel or a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  would result in our performing another assessment prior to the required july  annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in future additional charges against earnings for goodwill write offs or other asset impairments 
any future goodwill impairment would have no impact on polyone s required financial ratios under the receivable sale facility and the revolving credit facility 
however  the available borrowings under the revolving credit facility would effectively be reduced by of any after tax impairment write off 
polyone performed a goodwill impairment assessment as of december  on its plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and on its formulators reporting unit 
the average fair values of the market approach and the income approach exceeded the carrying value of these reporting units by for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and by for the formulators reporting unit 
using the lowest fair value determined by these two methodologies would have resulted in a fair value that exceeded the carrying value by for the plastic compounds and colors reporting unit and by for the formulators reporting unit 
polyone corporation the following is a summary of the key estimates used in preparing these valuations under the income and market approaches plastic compounds and colors formulators income approach long term growth rate capital spending as of depreciation through year increasing to by year change in accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable as of change in sales equity control premium weighted average cost of capital market approach multiple of next year sales x x multiple of next year ebitda x x multiple of next year ebit x x multiple of next year debt free cash flow x x we did recognize an impairment charge at december  as a result of the determination to report three non core businesses as discontinued operations as announced on january  the net assets of these businesses held for sale were reduced to their estimated future net proceeds 
for additional details regarding these charges  see note b to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  income taxes estimates of full year taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions are used in the tax rate calculation  which change throughout the year 
management uses judgment in estimating what the income will be for the year 
because judgment is involved  there is risk that the tax rate may significantly increase or decrease in any period 
in determining income loss for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
pensions and post retirement benefits included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs  which are measured using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including polyone corporation assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 
our net pension and post retirement benefit cost was approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  excluding the impact of restructuring actions 
the increase in net pension and post retirement expense during fiscal was primarily a result of lower plan assets  a reduction in the discount rate from to  and a reduction in the expected return on plan assets from to 
to develop our discount rate  we considered the available yields on high quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we also considered the historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we considered the duration of the plan liabilities and gave more weight to equity positions  including public and private equity investments and real estate  than to fixed income securities 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the fiscal net pension and post retirement expense by approximately million 
likewise  a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased the fiscal net pension cost by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to highly volatile market conditions 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point decrease or increase in the discount rate would have increased or decreased the minimum pension liability by approximately million as of december  the rate of increase in medical costs over the next five years was increased in to reflect both actual experience and projected expectations 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
employees hired after december  are not eligible to participate in the post retirement plan 
contingencies polyone is subject to various investigations  claims  and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
any liability that may result from these proceedings  and any liability that is judged to be probable and estimable  has been accrued 
any potential liability not accrued is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on polyone s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows

further  the financing arrangements limit payments for purposes such as capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends 
on september   the required financial ratios in the financing arrangements were amended

polyone corporation the following table summarizes polyone s obligations related to long term debt  leases guarantees and purchase obligation as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases standby letters of credit guarantees purchase obligations total profitable operations in will be important to maintain the existing levels of available capital resources  any refinancing of a portion of the existing capital resources  and the execution of our announced restructuring initiatives 
expected sources of cash in include net income  borrowings under existing loan agreements and the expected sale of the discontinued operations 
expected uses of cash in include approximately million of long term debt that comes due during the year  interest expense and discount on sale of accounts receivable totaling approximately million  cash taxes  contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans  spending for previously announced restructuring initiatives in progress as of december  totaling approximately million and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated between million and million  while depreciation and amortization for totaled million 
percentage changes in the levels of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable are expected to change by approximately the corresponding expected percentage increase in sales 
there is also a timing difference between cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans and the expense for these plans reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  cash contributions to qualified defined benefit pension plans totaled approximately million  while the expense for these plans reflected in the consolidated statement of operations totaled approximately million 
polyone s pension contribution of approximately million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans exceeded the required minimum funding of approximately million 
polyone currently estimates that the required minimum funding in will approximate million unless the proposed us legislation providing funding relief is passed  in which case the minimum required funding would decrease to approximately million 
polyone currently estimates a projected minimum funding requirement in of approximately million under existing regulations versus million under the proposed us funding relief legislation 
any funding in by polyone in excess of the required minimum will depend upon the available cash flows from the business 
a funding contribution in excess of the minimum required would reduce any otherwise required funding in based on current projections  we believe that we should be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures  and that cash flow generated from operations  along with the borrowing capacity under the revised revolving credit facility and new receivables sale facility  should be adequate to fund operations and to meet debt service requirements
