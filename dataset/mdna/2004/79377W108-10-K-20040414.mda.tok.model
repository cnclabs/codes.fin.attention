management s overview saks incorporated together with its subsidiaries  the company is a us retailer operating traditional and luxury department stores in states 
the company operates its business through two principal business segments the saks department store group sdsg and saks fifth avenue enterprises sfae 
the company s merchandise offerings primarily consist of apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories  and to a lesser extent  gifts and home items 
the company offers national branded merchandise complemented by differentiated product through exclusive merchandise from core vendors  assortments from unique and emerging suppliers  and proprietary brands 
when aided by enhanced merchandise presentation and a high level of customer service  the company considers its merchandising strategies to provide the customer a preferred distribution channel for its merchandise 
the company seeks to create value to its shareholders through improving returns on its invested capital 
the company attempts to generate top line growth while improving merchandising margins and developing a cost effective operations structure to increase returns 
integral to this objective are enhancing vendor relations  purchasing efficiencies  and differentiated product to maximize merchandise margins  using operating cash flows to repurchase debt and equity or to reinvest in capital projects or other areas of the business  continuously seeking opportunities to rationalize the company s cost structure  and actively managing the real estate portfolio by routinely evaluating underproductive stores and potential growth opportunities 
the retail industry is subject to domestic and international economic trends 
changes in consumer confidence and fluctuations in financial markets can influence cyclical trends  particularly in the luxury sector  and can also cause secular trends in certain traditional department store trade areas 
additionally  a number of the company s stores are in tourist markets  including the flagship saks fifth avenue new york store 
the retail environment remains challenging  although the company enjoyed an improving economy in the latter half of the uncertainty of economic conditions continues to make the forecasting of near term results difficult  but the company believes that prevailing trends and conditions indicate that the company will achieve earnings growth in over levels 
this improvement is expected to include moderate consolidated comparable store sales growth and continued improvement in the gross margin rate  while further reducing interest expense 
these objectives will have to be accomplished in the face of increased depreciation from recent capital investments and selling  general and administrative expenses that are expected to rise at approximately the same level as sales  partially attributed to a first quarter decline in the proprietary credit card contribution as the company reaches the first anniversary of the april  sale of its proprietary credit card accounts receivable

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion aggregates the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition sales and the related gross margin are recorded at the time our customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take ownership of the merchandise 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of this policy 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
however  given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns are affected within a matter of days of the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
cost of sales and inventory valuation excluding depreciation and amortization the company s inventory is stated at the lower of lifo cost or market using the retail method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail values for merchandise held for sale at too high a level  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns and overly optimistic or overly conservative shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
proprietary credit cards prior to april  the carrying value of the company s retained interest in credit card receivables required a substantial amount of management judgment and estimates 
at the time credit card receivables were sold to third party investors through the securitization program  generally accepted accounting principles required that the company recognize a gain or loss equal to the excess of the estimated fair value of the consideration to be received from the individual interest sold over the cost of the receivables sold 
as the receivables were collected  the estimated gains and losses were reconciled to the actual gains and losses 
given that the company generated credit card receivables of approximately billion per year and average outstanding sold receivables were generally billion to billion  a substantial majority of the annual estimated credit gains and losses had been reconciled to actual gains and losses 
only that portion of the gains and losses attributable to the outstanding securitized

determining the fair value of the consideration to be received from the individual interest sold included estimates of the following amounts associated with the sold portfolio the gross finance charge income to be generated by the portfolio which required estimates of payment rates  the coupon interest rate due to the third party investors  bad debts  cost of servicing the portfolio  and assumed cash flow discount rates 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements reflect the critical estimates and assumptions utilized 
items that were considered in making judgments and preparing estimates and factors that can lead to variations in the consolidated financial results were as follows finance charge income was billed at a contractual rate monthly and warranted little judgment or estimates 
the expected credit card customer payment rate was based on historical payment rates weighted to recent payment rate trends 
to the extent credit card customers paid off their balances sooner than estimated  this net gain was reduced 
conversely  if the credit card customers paid off balances over a longer period of time  the net gain was increased 
the future coupon interest rate due to the third party investors was estimated using the fixed interest rates in place and estimated floating interest rates over the estimated life of the portfolio 
to the extent floating interest rates increased beyond the increase embedded in the estimates  the net gain was reduced 
to the extent floating interest rates did not increase to the level embedded in the estimates  the net gain was increased 
bad debts expected from the sold portfolio were based on historical write off rates  weighted to recent write off trends and increased or decreased to reflect management s outlook for trends to develop over the next to months 
to the extent there were positive or negative factors on the credit card customers ability or intent to pay off the outstanding balance eg  unemployment rates  level of consumer debt or bankruptcy legislation  the actual bad debt to be realized could have exceeded or been less than the amount estimated 
bad debts in excess of those embedded in the estimates reduced the net gain 
conversely  bad debts less than those embedded increased the net gain 
delinquent accounts were written off automatically after the passage of seven months without receiving a monthly payment equal to of the minimum contractual payment 
minimum monthly contractual payments ranged from to 
accounts were written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy  customer death or fraud 
the cost of servicing the portfolio was estimated using the company s historical operating costs 
this estimate was subject to minimal risk of deviation 
the assumed cash flow discount rates were based on the weighted average cost of debt and were subject to typical interest rate volatility in the debt markets 
the most sensitive assumptions in calculating the gain on sold receivables were the credit card customers payment rate  the estimate for bad debts and the assumed cash flow discount rates 
the following table represents the company s assumptions in measuring the fair value of retained interests in accounts receivable in and weighted average interest rates applied to credit card balances weighted average payment rate credit losses expected from the principal amount of receivables sold weighted average cost of funding

index to financial statements subsequent to april  following the sale of the company s proprietary credit card business  the company no longer maintains a retained interest in the credit card receivables 
there are minimal accounting judgments and uncertainties affecting the accounting for the credit card program compensation  credit card servicing compensation and servicing expenses 
initial proceeds allocated to the program and servicing agreement are being amortized into income ratably over the lives of the agreement 
ongoing income associated with honoring the credit cards under the program agreement  promoting the credit cards and servicing the credit cards is recognized monthly contemporaneous with providing these services 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of the exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported and incurred but not reported claims considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 
depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over one half of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property  equipment and goodwill 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
the company utilizes the straight line depreciation method and a variety of depreciable lives 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
internally generated computer software is amortized over to years 
generally  no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets is considered 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a loss or gain on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is being realized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
recoverability of the carrying value of store assets is assessed upon the occurrence of certain events eg  opening a new store near an existing store or announcing plans for a store closing and  absent certain events  annually 
the recoverability assessment requires judgment and estimates for future store generated cash flows 
the underlying estimates for cash flows include estimates for future sales  gross margin rates  inflation and store expenses 
during  the company recorded million in impairment charges associated with stores in which the estimated discounted cash flows would not recover the carrying value of the store assets 
there are other stores in which current cash flows are not adequate to recover the carrying value of the store assets 
however  the company believes that estimated sales growth and gross margin improvement will enhance the cash flows of these stores such 
table of contents 
index to financial statements that the carrying value of the store assets will be recovered 
generally these stores were recently opened and require a two to five year period to develop the customer base to attain the required cash flows 
to the extent management s estimates for sales growth and gross margin improvement are not realized  future annual assessments could result in impairment charges 
income and other taxes the majority of the company s deferred tax assets at january  consist of federal net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and at january   the company believes that it will be profitable during the periods through  allowing it to sufficiently utilize the carrying value of the benefit of the federal net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent management s estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction is greater than or less than management s current estimates  future increases or decreases in the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards could occur 
the company is routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes 
these audits include questioning the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company often accrues charges for probable exposures 
during  the company concluded a federal income tax examination for the and tax years on terms favorable to previously accrued exposures associated with those tax years 
therefore  the company decreased the amount previously accrued for probable exposures 
additionally  the company reevaluated its exposures to state related tax filing positions and determined the need to provide for additional reserves 
the net effect of this federal and state reserve adjustment resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
at january   the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company was to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
at january   two of the company s five open tax years were undergoing examination by the internal revenue service 
pension plans pension expense is based on information provided by outside actuarial firms that use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to associates and allocates this cost to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
the pension plans are valued annually on november st 
the projected unit credit method is utilized in recognizing the pension liabilities 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates  after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries  as of the annual measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based upon the aa corporate bond yield as of the measurement date 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net pension expense 
at november   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s abo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is million on the abo and million on pension expense 
to the extent the abo increases  the after tax effect of such increase serves to reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
it is the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements company s policy to invest approximately of the pension fund assets in equities  in fixed income securities and in real estate 
this expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the counsel of the company s outside investment advisors 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this gain reduces future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is likewise not affected 
rather  this loss increases pension expense over approximately to years 
during  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on assets and anticipates lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets to in  which is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed average rate of compensation increases is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
this rate is estimated to be for the periods following november  and is utilized principally in calculating the pbo and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a change in the assumed rate of compensation increases would not be material to the pbo or annual pension expense 
at november   the company had unrecognized pension expense of million related to the expected return on assets exceeding actual investment returns  actual compensation increases exceeding assumed average rate of compensation and plan amendments  contributions subsequent to the measurement date  and other differences between underlying actuarial assumptions and actual results 
this delayed recognition of expense is incorporated into the million underfunded status of the plans at november  during january  the company voluntarily contributed approximately million to the plans to reduce the underfunding  and expects no further contributions in and minimal funding requirements in and inflation and deflation inflation and deflation affect the costs incurred by the company in its purchase of merchandise and in certain components of its sg a expenses 
the company attempts to offset the effects of inflation  which has occurred in recent years in sg a  through price increases and control of expenses  although the company s ability to increase prices is limited by competitive factors in its markets 
the company attempts to offset the effects of merchandise deflation  which has occurred in recent years  through control of expenses 
seasonality the company s business  like that of most retailers  is subject to seasonal influences  with a significant portion of net sales and net income realized during the second half of the fiscal year  which includes the holiday selling season 
in light of these patterns  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first three fiscal quarters of each year  and working capital needs are greater in the last two fiscal quarters of each year 
the increases in working capital needs during the fall season have typically been financed with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement 
generally  more than of the company s net sales and more than of net income are generated during the fourth fiscal quarter
