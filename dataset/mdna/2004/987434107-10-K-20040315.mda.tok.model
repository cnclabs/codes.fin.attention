item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction the operating revenue of the company s stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue and  to a much lesser extent  from compensation paid by the networks to its affiliated stations for broadcasting network programming 
the stations primary operating expenses are for employee compensation  news gathering  production  programming and promotion costs 
a high proportion of the operating expenses of the stations are fixed 
advertising is sold for placement within and adjoining a station s network and locally originated programming 
advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured principally by periodic audience surveys 
in addition  advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
rates are highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a national television network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the gross revenue of the company s stations was generated from local advertising  which is sold by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts 
the remainder of the advertising revenue primarily represents national advertising  which is sold by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  adam young inc ayi  a national advertising sales representative 
the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
the advertising revenue of the company s stations are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered election years due to spending by political candidates  which spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect its financial position and results of operations 
the company s critical accounting policy with respect to the valuation of accounts receivable is its determination as to the collectibility of account receivable from advertisers 
the nature of the business does not lend itself to a concentration of receivables from individual customers 
experience has been that customer defaults have been consistent with the company s accrual of bad debt expense and that the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover the likely exposure to such defaults 
the company s accounting for long lived program assets requires judgment as to the likelihood that such assets will generate sufficient revenue to cover the associated expense 
many of the company s program commitments are for syndicated shows which are produced by syndicators to be aired on a first run basis 
such shows do not generally stay in production if they do not attract a significant audience 
if the syndicator cancels a show  the company s liability for future payments is eliminated 
accordingly  the company has generally not experienced significant write downs from programming commitments 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
under the new rules  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statement 
on february   the company announced that it had adopted a new policy for recognizing the useful lives of its network affiliation agreements and that such intangibles will be amortized over a period of years

as a result of this decision  the company restated its earnings for the full year ended december  and for the first three quarters of  and recorded additional amortization expense of million and million on these intangible assets in and  respectively see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting for the impairment of property  equipment and intangible assets is assessing the recoverability by making assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions materially change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for these assets 
at december   the company had million in net property and equipment  million of indefinite life intangible assets and million of finite life intangible assets  net 
during  the company did not record any impairment losses related to long lived assets
