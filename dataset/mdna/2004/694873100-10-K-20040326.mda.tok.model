item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this section 
executive overview management of the company considers the following items to be key performance indicators in evaluating company performance comparable or same store sales stores are deemed comparable stores on the first day of the month following the one year anniversary of their opening or expansion relocation 
management of the company considers same store sales to be an important indicator of current company performance 
same store sales results are important in achieving operating leverage of certain expenses such as store payroll  store occupancy  depreciation  general and administrative expenses  and other costs that are somewhat fixed 
positive same store sales results generate greater operating leverage of expenses while negative same store sales results negatively impact operating leverage 
same store sales results also have a direct impact on the company s total net sales  cash  and working capital 
net merchandise margins management analyzes the components of net merchandise margins  specifically initial markup and markdowns as a percentage of net sales 
any inability to obtain acceptable levels of initial markups or any significant increase in the company s use of markdowns could have an adverse impact on the company s gross margin results and results of operations 
operating margin management views operating margin as a key indicator of the company s success 
the key drivers of operating margins are comparable store net sales  net merchandise margins  and the company s ability to control operating expenses 
operating margin for fiscal  and  was  and  respectively 
the company s highest historical operating margin was for fiscal store sales trends management evaluates store sales trends in assessing the operational performance of the company s store expansion strategies 
important store sales trends include average net sales per store  average net sales per square foot  and average trend sales for new stores 
average net sales per store in thousands for fiscal  and were   and  respectively 
average net sales per square foot were  and  respectively 
cash flow and liquidity working capital management evaluates cash flow from operations  liquidity and working capital to determine the company s short term operational financing needs 
cash flows from operations were significantly higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher net income driven by the comparable store net sales increase in fiscal management expects cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance operations without borrowing under the company s credit facility 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the company s retail store locations or upon shipment for orders placed through the company s website 
the company records the sale of gift cards as a current liability and recognizes a sale when a customer redeems a gift card 
the amount of the gift card liability is determined taking into account the company s estimate of the portion of gift cards that will not be redeemed or recovered 
the company accrues for estimated sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
actual return rates have historically been within management s expectations and the reserves established 
however  in the event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  the company s operational results could be adversely affected 
the company accrued 
million at the end of fiscal for estimated sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost is determined using the retail inventory method 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
management bases the decision to mark down merchandise primarily upon its current rate of sale and the age of the item  among other factors 
to the extent that management estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s gross margins and operating results 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment  and the global economy  could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of its long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
insurance reserves the company is responsible for workers compensation insurance claims up to a specified aggregate stop loss amount 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated claims  both reported and incurred but not reported  based on historical claims experience and other estimated assumptions 
actual claims activity has historically been within management s expectations and the reserves established 
to the extent claims experience or management s estimates change  additional charges may be recorded in the future up to the aggregate stop loss amount for each policy year 

table of contents accrued sublease loss charges the company remains liable under two operating leases covering its former corporate offices and a former store location 
these facilities remain vacant as of the date of this filing 
at the end of fiscal  the company had accrued million to account for the difference between the company s remaining contractual lease obligations and the rate and timeframe within which the company expected to be able to sublease these properties 
during fiscal  based on a review of real estate market conditions and on going negotiations  the company revised its sublease assumptions and increased its accrued sublease loss charges by million to a total of million 
to the extent management s estimates relating to the company s ability to sublease these facilities at the assumed rates or within the assumed timeframes changes or is incorrect  additional charges or reversals of previous charges may be recorded in the future 
at january   the aggregate remaining obligations under these leases were approximately million for the former corporate offices and approximately million for the former store location 
these amounts are included in the contractual obligations table within item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
the combined federal and state income tax expense was calculated using estimated effective annual tax rates 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value through a valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
litigation the company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to its business 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the company and  from time to time  may make provisions for potential litigation losses 
depending on the actual outcome of pending litigation  charges in excess of any provisions could be recorded in the future  which may have an adverse effect on the company s operating results see note to the consolidated financial statements
