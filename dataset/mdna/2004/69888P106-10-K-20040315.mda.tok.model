the financial data contained in this section is in thousands 
overview although the company achieved the most successful year in its history in fiscal year  there are many industry and economic factors and risks that can affect the growth of the company 
the most significant of these factors include i intense competition from brand name and generic manufacturers  ii the company s introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate significant gross margins  iii resources and or funding available to the company for the research and development of new products  iv the company s dependence on a limited number of products and the duration of those products as significant revenue generators  v the actions of brand name manufacturers to introduce their own generic versions of brand drugs and to prevent or discourage the use of generic equivalent products or delay and or prevent entry of the company s products into the market through litigation or other means  vi funding available to the company for litigation which can be protracted and expensive  vii the company s dependence upon revenues from products distributed through agreements with third parties and potential supply disruptions resulting from the inability by third party suppliers to meet expected demand and viii the company s ability to continue its licensing of authorized generics from brand companies 
as described below  the company believes it has a comprehensive business plan in place to address these challenges and mitigate such risks 
in order to secure financing to support the expansion of its business  the company obtained additional funds through the issuance of  of senior subordinated convertible debt in september implementation of these strategies could also require additional debt and or equity financing  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain any additional required financing when needed and on terms acceptable or favorable to it 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  research and development  marketing and other resources 
consequently  many of the company s competitors may be able to develop products and or processes competitive with  or superior to  those of the company 
furthermore  the company may not be able to differentiate its products from those of its competitors  successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly than those of its competitors or offer purchasers of its products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by its competitors 
the company s principal strategy  in addressing its competition  is to offer customers a consistent supply of a broad line of generic drugs at competitive pricing 
revenues and gross margin derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors believed to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period expires  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
however  as other generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for competing products  that market share  and the price of that product  will typically decline depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
a large portion of the company s revenues has been derived from the sales of generic drugs during the day marketing exclusivity period and from the sale of generic products where there is limited competition 
the company  through its internal development program and strategic alliances and relationships  is committed to developing new products that have limited competition and longer product life cycles 
in addition to expected new product introductions as part of its various strategic alliances and relationships  the company plans to continue to invest significantly in its internal research and development efforts while  at the same time  seeking additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements or acquisitions of complementary products and businesses  additional first to file opportunities  selective vertical integration with raw material suppliers and unique dosage forms to differentiate its products in the marketplace 
in addition to its own product development program  the company has several strategic alliances through which it co develops and distributes products 
these strategic alliances offer the company many advantages including additional resources for increased activity  expertise for dissimilar products or technologies  and a sharing of both the costs and risks of new product development 
as a result of its internal program and these strategic alliances  the company s pipeline of potential products includes andas five of which have been tentatively approved  pending with  and awaiting approval from  the fda 
the company pays a percentage of the gross profits or sales to its strategic partners on sales of products covered by its distribution agreements 
generally  products that the company develops internally  without having to split any profits with its strategic partners  contribute higher gross margins than products covered under distribution agreements 
the company is engaged in efforts  subject to fda approval and other factors  to introduce new products through its research and development efforts and distribution and development agreements with third parties 
in fiscal year  the company obtained the marketing rights to paroxetine  the generic version of gsk s paxil r  in connection with the gsk settlement between the company  gsk and certain of its affiliates  and pentech 
as a result of the settlement  par and gsk entered into the gsk supply agreement  pursuant to which par began marketing paroxetine  supplied and licensed from gsk  in the united states in september and the commonwealth of puerto rico in may the gsk settlement also provides that the company s right to distribute paroxetine will be suspended if at any time there is not another generic version fully substitutable for paxil available for purchase in the united states 
on september   another generic drug manufacturer  apotex  launched a generic version of paxil r 
gsk has sued apotex for patent infringement and is currently appealing a district court decision adverse to gsk 
in april  gsk launched a longer lasting  newly patented version of the drug  paxil cr r 
the company expects paxil cr r s market share to continue to grow in fiscal year  which may cause the company s sales of paroxetine tablets to decrease 
the company understands that other generic drug manufactures have filed andas in respect of paroxetine and that the marketing exclusivity period ended on march  but  at this time  cannot predict the timing of launches by these competitors or the potential effect of such competition on its sales 
the day marketing exclusivity period in respect of fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  which par sells pursuant to a distribution agreement with genpharm  and the day marketing exclusivity period granted in respect of fluoxetine mg capsules  which par sells pursuant to a development and supply agreement with dr 
reddy  both expired at the end of january in addition  the day marketing exclusivity period granted to the company by the fda in respect of megestrol acetate oral suspension  which is not subject to any profit sharing agreement  expired in mid january as the company expected  additional generic competitors  with products comparable to all three strengths of its fluoxetine products  began entering the market in the first quarter of  eroding the pricing that the company had received during the exclusivity periods  particularly on the mg and mg strengths 
nevertheless  the company maintained a significant market share for fluoxetine mg capsules and  despite fda approvals for two competing generic megestrol acetate oral suspension products received in the first quarter of and the second quarter of  the company also maintained a significant share of the market for megestrol acetate oral suspension as of december  although megestrol acetate oral suspension and fluoxetine mg capsules are expected to continue to contribute significantly to the company s overall performance in fiscal year  the growth of the company s product line through new product introductions has somewhat reduced the company s reliance on these products 
in fiscal year  the company s top four selling products accounted for approximately of its total revenues  as compared to and  respectively  of its total revenues in fiscal years and one of the products  paroxetine  which the company began marketing in fiscal year  was not one of the top four products in either of the preceding years and accounted for approximately of the company s total revenues and a significant portion of its gross margin 
the aggregate net sales and gross margins generated by two other products  fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension  accounted for a significant portion of the company s overall revenues and gross margins in all three fiscal years and any reduction in pricing for these products  without the addition of new products  could adversely affect the company s overall financial performance 
the percentage of the company s total revenues that these two products represent  excluding paroxetine  has decreased to in fiscal year from and  respectively in fiscal years and although there can be no such assurance  the company anticipates continuing to introduce new products in fiscal year while seeking to increase sales of certain existing products in an effort to offset sales and gross margin declines resulting from competition on any of its significant products 
the company seeks to reduce its financial dependence with respect to the top four products  by adding additional products through  its internal development program  new and existing distribution agreements or acquisitions of complementary products or businesses 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products are increasingly suing companies that produce generic forms of their patented brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filing person may either certify that the patent listed by the fda as covering the generic product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the generic drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
under either circumstance  there is a risk that a branded pharmaceutical company may sue the filing person for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
also  other companies that compete with the company by manufacturing  developing and or selling the same generic pharmaceutical products may similarly file lawsuits against the company or its strategic partners claiming patent infringement or invalidity 
because substantially all of the company s business involves the marketing and development of off patent products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  condition financial and other  prospects and results of operations 
the company s strategy to broaden its product line also includes the licensing of authorized generic products from brand companies 
on november   the company commenced shipment of substitutable generic metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets supplied and licensed from bms 
release of the metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets occurred simultaneously with the release of this product by another generic company 
metformin hydrochloride extended release tablets are the generic version of bms s glucophage xr r tablets  which is used in the treatment of type diabetes 
the company has broadened its product line by entering into distribution and marketing agreements  as well as contract manufacturing agreements  through which it distributes generic pharmaceutical products manufactured by others 
the company has entered into distribution agreements with several companies to develop  distribute and promote such generic pharmaceutical products 
the company cannot give assurance that the efforts of its contractual partners will continue to be successful or that it will be able to renew such agreements or that it will be able to enter into new agreements with additional companies 
any alteration to or termination of the company s current material distribution and marketing agreements  or any failure to enter into new and similar agreements  could materially adversely affect its business  condition financial and other  prospects or results of operations 
the company seeks to mitigate potential supply issues from its third party suppliers through regular communication and planning or entering into contracts when possible 
results of operations general the company s net income of  in fiscal year increased  from  in fiscal year total revenues of  in increased  from  in fiscal year  driven primarily by additional net sales of new products introduced in the revenue growth produced higher gross margin dollars in  which increased  to  from  in fiscal year in addition  the company continued to invest significantly in its research and development activities and infrastructure 
spending of  on research and development for fiscal year increased from  for fiscal year  while selling  general and administrative costs of  for fiscal year increased  from the prior year 
the company believes that the increased costs will be required to support its future growth 
in addition  the company recorded a charge of  in selling  general and administrative expenses in related to a retirement package for the company s former chairman  president and chief executive officer 
fiscal year results include income from settlements of  related to the company s termination of its litigation with bms and acquisition termination charges of  in connection with its termination of negotiations with international specialty products isp related to the company s then proposed purchase of the combined isp finetech fine chemical business based in haifa  israel and columbus  ohio 
the company also experienced significant sales  gross margin and net income growth in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year net income of  for fiscal year increased  from  for fiscal year net income in included the favorable impact on the tax provision related to the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance of  related to net operating loss nol carryforwards 
net sales of  in fiscal year increased  or  from fiscal year the increased revenues were primarily the result of new product introductions in fiscal year combined with the success of megestrol acetate oral suspension  introduced in the third quarter of the increase in revenues was achieved despite lower sales of fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  which were introduced with day exclusivity in august and experienced severe price competition in fiscal year the sales growth generated increased gross margins of  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in results for fiscal year included increased spending on research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses of  and  respectively  primarily due to increased activity with development partners  and additional legal fees  personnel costs  product liability insurance and shipping costs associated with new product launches 
sales and gross margins of the company s products are principally dependent upon i the pricing practices of competitors or their removal of competing products from the market  ii the introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products  iii the ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits from any one product  iv the continuation of existing distribution agreements  v the introduction of new distributed products  vi the consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii the willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii the approval of andas and introduction of new manufactured products  ix the granting of potential marketing exclusivity periods  x the extent of market penetration for the existing product line and xi the level and amount of customer service see business competition 
revenues total revenues of  for fiscal year increased  or  from  for fiscal year the revenue growth in was driven largely by the september introduction of paroxetine in the united states  sold through the gsk supply agreement  which totaled approximately  in net sales for fiscal year additionally  net sales of other new products  including metformin er glucophage xr r  introduced in december and sold under a distribution agreement with bms  tizanidine zanaflex r  introduced in july and sold under a distribution agreement with dr 
reddy  torsemide demadex r and minocycline minocin r  introduced in the second quarter of and manufactured by the company  contributed to the revenue growth in net sales of fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension were approximately  and  respectively  for the most recent year  reflecting a small increase over the prior fiscal year 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues in fiscal years and the company is substantially dependent upon distributed products for its overall sales and  as the company continues to introduce new products under its distribution agreements  it expects that this dependence will continue 
any inability by suppliers to meet expected demand could adversely affect the company s future sales 
at this time  it is difficult to predict with accuracy the effects of potential competition on future sales of paroxetine 
several market uncertainties currently exist including the possibility and timing of additional generic competitors entering the market or the ability of gsk  under the gsk supply agreement  to suspend par s right to distribute paroxetine if at any time another generic version of paxil r is not being marketed 
two generic competitors have been granted fda approval to market generic versions of megestrol acetate oral suspension since the expiration of the company s day marketing exclusivity period  but  as of december   did not have a significant effect on the company s net sales of the product 
at this time  the company cannot accurately predict the effect the generic competition will have on future periods  however  the company believes that megestrol acetate oral suspension will be a significant sales and gross margin contributor in fiscal year  despite the competition 
the company will continue to evaluate the effects of such competition and will record a price protection reserve when  if and to the extent it deems necessary 
as a result of generic competition beginning in the first quarter of following the expiration of the company s day marketing exclusivity period  the sales price for fluoxetine had substantially declined from the price that the company had charged during the exclusivity period 
accordingly  the company s sales and gross margins generated by fluoxetine following the expiration of the exclusivity period were adversely affected 
despite pricing declines  fluoxetine mg continued to be a significant sales and gross margin contributor in fiscal year if additional competitors enter the market in fiscal year  the company expects that its sales and gross margins for the product will decline 
pursuant to an agreement with genpharm  the company receives a portion of the profits  as defined in the agreement  generated from kremers urban development co 
s kudco  a subsidiary of schwarz pharma ag of germany  sale of omeprazole  the generic version of astra zeneca s prilosec r 
in the third quarter of  two generic competitors began selling forms of omeprazole that also compete with the prescription form of prilosec r  significantly reducing the company s share of profits related to omeprazole from approximately  for the first six months of fiscal year to  for the remainder of the year 
the company expects that the impact of this competition will continue to have an adverse effect on its omeprazole revenues in future periods 
total revenues of  for fiscal year increased  or  from total revenues in fiscal year the revenue increase was primarily due to higher net sales of megestrol acetate oral suspension  introduced in late july  new products introduced in fiscal year  particularly tizanidine zanaflex r  metformin glucophage r  flecainide tambocor r and nizatidine axid r  sold under distribution agreements with reddy or genpharm  and the addition of five bms brand products  sold pursuant to an agreement with bms 
net sales of fluoxetine and megestrol acetate oral suspension in fiscal year were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  in the prior year 
net sales of distributed products represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenues in fiscal years and gross margins the company s gross margin of  of total revenues for fiscal year increased  from  of total revenues for fiscal year the gross margin dollar increase was achieved primarily as a result of contributions from sales of new products  as described above  and  to a lesser extent  higher sales of certain existing products and additional revenues from omeprazole pursuant to an agreement with genpharm 
in accordance with the gsk settlement and the pentech supply and marketing agreement  par pays royalties to gsk and pentech on sales of paroxetine 
as a result of these arrangements  the gross margin as a percentage of total revenues declined as net sales of paroxetine after profit splits yielded a significantly lower gross margin percentage than the company s average gross margin as a percentage of total revenues of its other products over the last three fiscal years 
in fiscal year  a higher gross margin contribution from fluoxetine mg due to increases in net sales and in the company s profit sharing percentage under its agreement with dr 
reddy following the end of the company s exclusivity period more than offset lower gross margin contributions from fluoxetine mg and mg tablets  which are subject to profit sharing agreements with genpharm 
as discussed above  additional generic manufacturers introduced and began marketing comparable fluoxetine products following the expiration of the company s exclusivity period in january  adversely effecting the company s sales volumes  selling prices and gross margins for the products  particularly the mg and mg strengths 
the company s gross margin for paroxetine  megestrol acetate oral suspension and fluoxetine mg could also decline when  and as  additional manufacturers introduce and market comparable generic products 
the company s gross margin for fiscal year of  of total revenues increased  from  of total revenues in the prior year 
the gross margin improvement was achieved primarily through the additional contributions from sales of higher margin new products  including megestrol acetate oral suspension and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of certain existing products 
megestrol acetate oral suspension contributed approximately  in additional gross margin for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the effects of gross margin declines resulting from lower pricing on the fluoxetine mg capsule were partially offset by an increase in the company s profit sharing percentage under an agreement with dr 
reddy 
although net sales of the fluoxetine products declined in  the increased profits on the mg capsule lessened the impact of the lower margin contributions from the mg and mg tablets 
inventory write offs were   and  respectively  for fiscal years  and the inventory write offs  taken in the normal course of business  were related primarily to the disposal of finished products due to short shelf lives and work in process inventory not meeting the company s quality control standards 
the write offs in fiscal year included the write off of inventory for a product whose launch was delayed due to unexpected patent issues and certain raw material not meeting the company s quality control standards 
the increase from fiscal year was primarily attributable to normally occurring write offs resulting from increased production required to meet higher sales and inventory levels 
the company maintains inventory levels that it believes are appropriate to optimize customer service 
operating expenses income research and development research and development expenses of  for fiscal year increased  or  from  for fiscal year the higher expenses were primarily attributable to biostudies  including the company s share of genpharm s biostudy costs for products covered under their distribution agreements 
in addition  higher costs were incurred for raw material and additional personnel to support increased research and development activity in fiscal year and in the future 
although there can be no such assurance  the company expects its total annual research and development expenses for fiscal year to exceed the total for fiscal year by approximately 
the increase is expected as a result of increased internal development activity  third party projects and research and development joint venture activity 
the company currently has andas for potential products two tentatively approved pending with  and awaiting approval from  the fda as a result of its own product development program 
in fiscal year  the company expects that at least ten of the potential products in active development will be the subjects of biostudies throughout fiscal year the company and genpharm have entered into a distribution agreement the genpharm product agreement  dated april  pursuant to which genpharm is developing products and submitting the corresponding andas to the fda and  subsequently  has agreed to manufacture the potential products covered under the agreement 
par will serve as the exclusive us marketer and distributor of the products  pay a share of the costs  including development and legal expenses incurred to obtain final regulatory approval  and pay genpharm a percentage of the gross profits on all sales of products covered by this agreement

the company is currently marketing one product and receiving royalties on another product covered under the genpharm product agreement 
the company and genpharm have also entered into a distribution agreement the genpharm distribution agreement  dated march  under the genpharm distribution agreement  genpharm pays the research and development costs associated with the products covered by the genpharm distribution agreement 
currently  there are seven andas for potential products three tentatively approved that are covered by the genpharm distribution agreement pending with  and awaiting approval from  the fda 
the company is currently marketing products under the genpharm distribution agreement

the company is currently marketing two products under the genpharm additional product agreement 
research and development expenses of  for fiscal year increased  or  from  for the prior year 
the increased costs were primarily attributable to additional payments of approximately  for development work performed for the company by unaffiliated companies  particularly aveva drug delivery systems  formerly elan transdermal technologies  inc aveva  a us subsidiary of nitto denko  related to the development of a clonidine transdermal patch and other products and  to a lesser extent  higher costs for personnel  the acquisition of finetech and funding of svc pharma  a joint venture partnership between the company and rhodes technologies  inc  an affiliated company of purdue pharma lp these expenses were partially offset by lower biostudy costs  primarily related to products covered under distribution agreements with genpharm  in fiscal year the company purchased finetech  based in haifa  israel  from isp in april one of the company s potential first to file products  latanoprost  resulted from the company s relationship with finetech prior to its acquisition 
in addition  the company and finetech are currently collaborating on two additional products for which andas have already been filed with the fda see notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisition of finetech 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative costs of  of total revenues for fiscal year increased  from  of total revenues for fiscal year the increase in was primarily attributable to higher costs for product liability and directors and officers insurance of approximately  a charge of  related to a retirement package for the company s former chairman  president and chief executive officer  and marketing expenses of approximately  in addition  the company incurred increased expenses it believes are necessary to support the company s growth  including costs for additional personnel of approximately  additional warehouse and administrative office facilities of  corporate strategic planning of  and information systems assessments 
distribution costs include those related to shipping products to the company s customers  primarily through the use of common carriers or external distribution services 
shipping costs of approximately  in fiscal year were comparable to costs of  in fiscal year although overall sales volumes increased in fiscal year  shipping costs remained at approximately the same level as fiscal year due to a reduced amount of reliance on an external distribution service 
the company s legal expenses in fiscal year were lower than those incurred in fiscal year due to the sharing of certain costs with a strategic partner 
the company anticipates that it will continue to incur a high level of legal expenses related to litigations connected with potential new product introductions see notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments  contingencies and other matters legal proceedings

the company paid the remaining balance on the mortgage loan in february critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition including the determination of sales returns and allowances  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to the company s significant development and marketing agreements are capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of intangible assets  the determination of depreciable and amortizable lives and issues related to legal proceedings 
in applying such policies  management must use some amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable and allowances the company recognizes revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss pass to its customers  and simultaneously records estimates for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  shelf stock or price protection adjustments or other sales allowances  as reductions in revenues  with corresponding adjustments to the accounts receivable allowances see notes to consolidated financial statements note accounts receivable 
the company has the historical experience and access to other information  including the total demand for each drug that the company manufactures or distributes  the company s market share  recent or pending new drug introductions  inventory practices of the company s customers  resales by its customers to end users having contracts with the company  and rebate agreements with each customer  necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such sales returns and allowances 
some of the assumptions used for certain of the company s estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as customer inventories at a particular point in time  or other market factors beyond the company s control 
the company regularly reviews all information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
the company s reserves related to the items described above at december  and totaled  and  respectively 
customer rebates are price reductions generally given to customers as an incentive to increase sales volume 
this incentive is based on a customer s volume of purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
chargebacks are price adjustments given to the wholesale customer for product it resells to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between the company and the providers 
the accounts receivable allowances include provisions for returns 
the company accepts returns of product according to the following i the returns must be approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request  ii the company generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will give such customer a credit for such return provided such product is returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such product s expiration date  iii any product that has more than six months until its expiration date may be returned to the company  however  no credit will be issued to the customer and iv the company will not accept returns of products if such products cannot be resold  unless the reason that such products cannot be resold is that the expiration date has passed 
the accounts receivable allowances also include provisions for doubtful accounts and price adjustments  including terms discounts  sales promotions and shelf stock adjustments 
terms discounts are given to customers that pay within a specific period of time 
the company may conduct sales or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive for the customer to purchase the company s products 
shelf stock adjustments are typically provided to a customer when the company lowers its invoice pricing and provides a credit for the difference between the old and new invoice prices for the inventory that the customer had on hand at the time of the price reduction 
the company will generally offer price protection for sales of new generic drugs for which it has a market exclusivity period 
such price protection accounts for the fact that the prices of such drugs typically will decline  sometimes substantially  when additional generic manufacturers introduce and market a comparable generic product following the expiration of an exclusivity period 
such price protection plans  which are common in the company s industry  generally provide for a shelf stock adjustment to customers with respect to the customer s remaining inventory at the expiration of the exclusivity period for the difference between the company s new price and the price at which the company originally sold the product 
the company may also offer price protection with respect to existing products for which it anticipates significant price erosion through an increase in competition 
the company estimates the amount by which prices will decline based on its monitoring of the number and status of fda applications and tentative approvals and its historical experience with other drugs for which the company had market exclusivity 
the company estimates the amount of shelf stock that will remain at the end of an exclusivity period based on both its knowledge of the inventory practices for wholesalers and retail distributors and conversations it has with its major customers 
using these factors  the company estimates the total price protection credit that it will have to issue at the end of an exclusivity period and records charges reductions of sales to accrue this amount for specific product sales that will be subject to price protection based on the company s estimate of customer inventory levels and market prices at the end of the exclusivity period 
as noted above  although the company believes it has the information necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such price protection at the time that the product is sold  there are inherent risks associated with these estimates 
the company adjusts its price protection reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from those estimates 
at december  and  the company did not have any significant price protection reserves 
research and development and marketing agreements the company will either capitalize or expense amounts related to the development and marketing of new products and technologies through third parties based on the company s determination of its ability to recover in a reasonable period of time the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
under the company s accounting policies  amounts related to the company s funding of the research and development efforts of third parties or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda where the company has no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by the company to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizabilty  as well as an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company records the value of these agreements based on the purchase price and subsequent milestone payments related to each agreement 
capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives over which the related cash flows are expected to be generated and charged to cost of goods sold 
market  regulatory or legal factors  among other things  may affect the realizability of the projected cash flows that an agreement was initially expected to generate 
the company regularly monitors these factors and subjects all capitalized costs to periodic impairment testing 
goodwill and intangible assets the company determines the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by independent third party valuation firms 
in addition  certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development and marketing of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment using a fair value approach 
intangible assets with definitive lives  also tested periodically for impairment  are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as a result of the acquisition of finetech in fiscal year  the company had recorded goodwill of  at december  in addition  intangible assets with definitive lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  and  respectively  at december  and legal proceedings the company records its costs  including patent litigation expenses  related to legal proceedings as incurred in selling  general and administrative expenses 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments  contingencies and other matters  the company is a party to several patent infringement matters whose outcome could have a material impact on its future profitability  cash flows and financial condition 
the company is also currently involved in other litigation matters  including certain patent actions  product liability and actions by former employees and believes that these actions are incidental to the business and that the ultimate resolution thereof will not have a material adverse effect on its future profitability  cash flows or financial condition 
the company is defending or intends to defend or  in cases where the company is plaintiff  prosecute these actions vigorously
