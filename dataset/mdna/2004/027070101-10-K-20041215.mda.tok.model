item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following table sets forth certain data from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenues  for each of the periods presented 
fiscal years ended october  october  september  revenues retail institutional total revenues cost of goods sold new product development and start up costs gross profit selling and marketing expense general and administrative expense provision for restructuring expense provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses operating profit interest expense  net income tax expense net income overview we believe we are the largest producer of dry pasta in north america 
we began operations in we believe our singular focus on pasta  our vertically integrated facilities and highly efficient production facilities focused primarily on specific market segments and our highly skilled workforce make us a more efficient company and enable us to produce high quality pasta at historically very competitive costs 
we believe that the combination of our low cost structure  our product strategy of offering branded  private label  imported and specialty products  our scalable production facilities and our key customer relationships create competitive advantages 
we generate revenues in two customer markets retail and institutional 
retail market revenues include the sales of our pasta products to customers who resell the pasta in retail channels including sales to grocery  club  mass merchant and discount stores and encompasses sales of our branded  private label  imported and specialty products 
these revenues represented and of our total revenue for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
institutional market revenues include revenues from product sales to customers who use our pasta as an ingredient in food products or who resell our pasta in the foodservice meals away from home market 
it also includes revenues from sales to government agencies and other customers that we pursue periodically 
the institutional market represented and of our total revenue for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
during the fiscal year  the retail dry pasta category in the united states experienced year over year declines in consumption of approximately to 
in our view this category decline  which had significant impact on the company s results for the year versus the prior year  is attributable to dietary changes by the american consumer to reduce their intake of carbohydrates 
as discussed more fully below  these consumption declines have resulted in significant revenue declines for the company  which in turn contributed to the necessity for the restructuring and rightsizing program initiated in the third quarter of fiscal as discussed below 
average sales prices for our non branded products vary depending on customer specific packaging and raw material requirements  product manufacturin g complexity and other service requirements 
average prices for our branded products are also based on competitive market factors 
average retail and institutional prices will also vary due to changes in the relative share of customer revenues and item specific sales volumes ie  product sales mix 
generally  average retail sales prices are higher than institutional sales prices 
selling prices of our branded products are significantly higher than selling prices in our other business units  including private label 
this results in higher revenues and gross profits than our non branded businesses 
revenues are reported net of cash discounts  product returns  and certain promotional and slotting allowances 
we introduced a portfolio of new reduced carb products in early fiscal  designed to help mitigate the impact of general pasta consumption declines 
wit h the introduction of our reduced carb product line  we have incurred millio n of new product development and start up costs 
these costs represent the upfron t costs incurred to produce a portfolio of new products expected to address carbohydrate awareness among consumers 
these costs included formulation development and product testing of a portfolio of low and reduced carb products incremental manufacturing and logistics costs including unplanned downtime on dedicated lines  efficiency losses  and excess product waste  overcoming limite d short term raw material availability and sourcing issues blending  transportation  etc  and quality assurance  outside testing and other direct product development costs 
we have also incurred million of introductory marketing costs related to the new reduced carb product line 
while the early demand for these products was relatively strong  subsequent sales trends have not met our expectations 
this product line has not yet grown to become a significant component of the pasta market and while we believe reduced carb products will fulfill a relevant role in the diets of some consumers  the product line will not be a driver of our sales in the short term 
we also developed a low carb product line under a supply agreement with atkin s nutritional services during fiscal year while early sales levels were encouraging  recent trends and revenues are not achieving the levels originally expected 
revenues under the agreement in fiscal year were million with no sales under the agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
as th e sales outlook for the atkins product line has become substantially diminished i n the fourth quarter  recoverability of million of certain assets relating t o the agreement became uncertain and was expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that inventories currently on hand relating to our reduced carb product line and the atkins agreement will either be sold in the normal course of business  or in the case of atkins related inventory  repurchased by atkins under the terms of the agreement  however the ultimate disposition of these inventories without additional cost to the company is dependent upon such facto rs 
we seek to develop strategic customer relationships with food industry leaders that have substantial pasta requirements 
we have a long term supply agreement through december  with sysco  and other non contractual arrangements with food industry leaders that provide for the pass through of direct material cost and certain other cost changes as pricing adjustments 
the pass throughs are generally limited to actual changes in cost and  as a result  impact margins in periods of changing costs and prices 
the pass throughs are generally effective to days following such cost changes and thereby significantly reduce the long term exposure of our operating results to the volatility of raw material costs 
these pass through arrangements also require us to pass on the benefits of any price decreases in raw material costs 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  packaging  manufacturing costs including depreciation and distribution costs 
a significant portion of our cost of goods sold is durum wheat 
we purchase durum wheat on the open market and  consequently  those purchases are subject to fluctuations in cost 
we manage our durum wheat cost risk through durum wheat cost pass through agreements in long term contracts and other non contractual arrangements with our customers as discussed above and advance purchase contracts for durum wheat which are generally less than twelve months in duration 
our new reduced carb product line includes significantly higher costs for raw materials and manufacturing than our other pasta products 
our capital asset strategy is to achieve low cost production through vertical integration and investment in the most current pasta making assets and technologies 
the manufacturing and distribution related capital assets that have been or will be acquired to support this strategy are depreciated over their respective economic lives 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business  we believe our depreciation expense for production and distribution assets may be higher than that of many of our competitors 
depreciation expense is a component of inventory cost and cost of goods sold 
selling and marketing costs constituted and of revenues for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
the company recorded million of introductory marketing costs related to the new reduced carb product line in fiscal year critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis discusses our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have bee n prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principle s generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long live d and intangible assets  the method of accounting for stock options  and the estimates used to record allowances for doubtful accounts  reserve for slow moving  damaged and discontinued inventory and derivatives 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgment s about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to our consolidated financial statement s for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
our most critica l accounting policies are described below 
impairment testing of intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize the cost of intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our brands and trademarks 
sfas no 
requires that we perform certai n fair value based tests of the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually and more frequently should events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we completed our impairment testing at the end of fiscal year and determined that no material impairment exists 
these impairment tests are impacted by judgments as to future cash flows and other considerations 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause our management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of intangible assets is impaired 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount o f an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be hel d and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which th e carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to b e disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in conjunction with our restructuring and rightsizing program  we suspended ful l operations at our kenosha  wisconsin manufacturing facility 
although we partially reactivated this facility in october  for a temporary period  we currently anticipate operations to be substantially suspended into fiscal we have reviewed this facility for impairment and have determined that this asset is not impaired 
stock options we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and have adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options is equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required b y sfas no 
and has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate of for fiscal  and for fiscal years and  dividend yield of zero for fiscal year and fiscal year and for fiscal year  a volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of 
for fiscal year  
fo r fiscal year and 
for fiscal year  and a weighted average expected life of the options of five years 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating th e fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fai r value of our employee stock options 
on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb stated tha t statement r  share based payment  is proposed for issuance and would be effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  this statement would require all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value 
retroactive application of the requirements of sfas no 
not statement r to the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the effective date would be permitted  but not required 
early adoption of statemen t r is encouraged 
accounts receivable significant customers during fiscal year  we generated of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to two multi national customers 
if our primary customers experience significan t adverse conditions in their industry or operations  our customers may not be able to meet their ongoing financial obligations to us for prior sales or complete the purchase of additional products from us under the terms of our existing purchase and sale commitments 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectibility o f our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg bankruptcy filings  and substantial down grading of credit scores  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe wil l be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts base d on the length of time the receivables are past due  and our historical experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts du e us could be reduced by a material amount 
reserve for slow moving  damaged and discontinued inventory we carry our inventory at standard costs  adjusted for capitalized variances  which approximate the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out fifo basis or market 
we periodically review our inventory for slow moving  damaged and discontinued items and provide reserves to reduce such items identified to thei r recoverable amounts 
promotional allowance promotional allowances related to our sales are recoded at the time revenue is recognized 
such allowances  where applicable  are estimated based on anticipated volume and promotional spending with specifi c customers 
derivatives we hold derivative financial instruments to hedge a variety of ris k exposures including interest rate risks associated with variable rate long term debt and foreign currency risks associated with our italian operations 
these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in detail in note to ou r consolidated financial statements 
we do not participate in speculative derivatives trading 
hedge accounting results when we designate and document th e hedging relationships involving these derivative instruments 
while we intend t o continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we did not believe that forecasted transactions would occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
to hedge foreign currency risks  we use futures contracts 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
these forward contracts ar e valued in a manner similar to that used by the market to value exchange traded contracts  that is  using standard valuation formulas with assumptions about future foreign currency exchange rates derived from existing exchange rates  an d interest rates observed in the market 
to hedge interest rate risks  an interes t rate swap is used to effectively convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate 
this instrument is valued using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts and the discounted expected variable cash payments 
the variable cash payments are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observed market interest rate curves 
we have not changed our methods of calculating these fair values or developing the underlying assumptions 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market condition s change 
our derivative instruments are not subject to multiples or leverage on the underlying commodity or price index 
information about the fair values  notional amounts  and contractual terms of these instruments can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements and the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we consider our historical business patterns and our regularly updated forecast s in determining the amounts of our foreign inventory purchases to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of our forecast we are assuming to be probable of occurring  and therefore eligible to be hedged 
the purchases are hedged for exposures to fluctuations i n foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk i n our interest rate and foreign currency hedges as the counter parties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
our exposure is in liquid currency euros  so there is minimal risk that appropriate derivatives to maintain our hedging program would not be available in the future 
restructuring and rightsizing program the pasta industry continued to experience the significant changes that have been seen over the last months  with us pasta consumption continuing to decrease as a result of recent changes in consumer diet trends 
during this period  we estimate the decline in industry wide consumption to be over million annualized pounds 
retail consumption of dry pasta as measured by ac nielsen declined by approximately to in volume for the months ended october  the production overcapacity that existed within the pasta industry  combined with decreasing consumer demand  has resulted in a highly competitive market share battle with pricing levels and operating margins comin g under increasing pressure 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we announced a restructuring and rightsizing program to better align our production capacity and cost structure with our current business and operating profile and the current pasta industry environment 
the restructuring and rightsizing program responds to industry wid e reductions in demand related to recent changes in consumer diet trends and to manufacturing overcapacity in the pasta industry 
the key strategic elements of the restructuring and rightsizing program include reductions in our workforce  manufacturing capacity and inventory levels and th e related reconfiguration of our distribution network 
in that regard  in july we suspended full operations at one of our manufacturing facilities kenosha  wisconsin  temporarily shutdown production at two of our four domestic manufacturing facilities excelsior springs  missouri and columbia  south carolina  and began preparing to exit eight of our leased domestic distribution centers 
as a result of the restructuring and rightsizing  our production capacity and output will more effectively match our anticipated sale s demand and we expect to generate significant cost savings and lower our inventory levels 
we recognized restructuring expenses relating to this program in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
a key strategic element of our restructuring and rightsizing program was the reduction of inventory levels 
as noted above  this was accomplished through th e suspension of one plant s operations and the temporary shutdowns of two other plants  as well as reducing our slow moving and discontinued inventory 
as of october   inventory levels decreased million from fiscal year end related to this element of the strategy  we recognized certain expenses o f million in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  as discusse d further below 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended october  revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ende d october  revenues decreased million  or  due to volume decline  and million  or  due to lower average selling prices resulting from overall competitive pressures in the pasta industry 
revenues declined by million  or  due to a reduction in payments received from the us government under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of revenues for are based on a week year  while revenues for were based on a week year 
revenues for the retail market decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  revenues decreased million  or  due to volume decline  and million  or  due to lower average selling prices resulting from competitive pressures and increased promotional support relating to branded sales 
revenues also declined by million  or  as a result of the amortization of slotting fees related to our reduced carb product introduction 
revenues declined by million  due to a reduction in payments received from the us government under the continued dumping and subsidy offse t act of revenues for the institutional market increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  revenues increased million  or  du e to volume growth and million  or  due to higher average selling price s and changes in sales mix 
our european and contract businesses performed well and drove the volume growth in fiscal year cost of goods sold included in costs of goods sold are the costs of our inventory reduction strategy  a key component of our restructuring and rightsizing program 
such costs totaled million during the year ended and include costs relating to the kenosha plant s suspended operations  costs incurred at two plants while temporarily shut down during july and the liquidation and write downs of certain slower moving or higher valued inventory the kenosha expenses include manufacturing costs that were incurred during the fiscal year which were expected to be absorbed as production costs during the year 
we set inventory cost standards based upon our expected annual production levels 
as a result of the actions taken to implement the restructuring and rightsizing program  including the suspension of production at the kenosha facility and the other temporary shutdowns  we determined that these costs woul d not be absorbed through production as inventory costs and we recognized these costs in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the kenosha plant also incurred costs as the plant s operations and production levels wound down  whil e preparing the plant for suspended operations 
temporary plant shutdown expenses include the ongoing expenses during shutdowns  which would normally be treated as production costs and charged to inventory but  in the absence of production to absorb the costs  have been charged to cost of goods sold as period costs 
the inventory adjustments were made to reflect expected recovery under our revised sales forecasts pursuant to the rightsizing strategy 
in addition to the inventory reduction costs of million  costs of goods sold increased by million reflecting higher per unit manufacturing costs  reduced by the impact of decreased sales volume of during fiscal year per unit manufacturing cost increased primarily due to lower actual production volumes than expected in original operating plans  which assumed an increase in production and sales over the prior year 
the lower utilization of production capacity  combined with a larger manufacturing and logistics cost structure in fiscal that includes proportionately higher levels of fixed costs  resulted in the substantial increase in cost of goods sold and lower gross profit 
the larger manufacturing and logistics cost structure in fiscal reflected higher anticipated production and increased sales than in fiscal in addition  increased operating costs  including higher utilities and freight costs  negatively impacted cost of goods sold 
new product development and start up costs the new product development and start up costs of million for the year ended october  related to ou r newly introduced reduced carb products 
these costs included formulation development and product testing of a portfolio of low and reduced carb products incremental manufacturing and logistics costs including unplanned downtime on dedicated lines  efficiency losses  and excess product waste  overcoming limited short term raw material availability and sourcing issues blending  transportation  etc  and quality assurance  outsid e testing and other direct product development costs 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended october  gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended october  gross profit was impacted by a number of factors as compared to the prior year  as discussed above including revenue decreases of million without corresponding decreases in cost of goods sold due to unabsorbed production costs expensed in fiscal  and the costs of our inventory reduction strategy and the temporary shut downs 
also affecting the decrease in the gross profit is the impact of the million charge for incremental costs associated with new product development and start up costs on the reduced carb products 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million reported for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in selling and marketing relates primarily to our introductory marketing support for the new reduced carb product line of million 
sellin g and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues increased to for the fiscal year ended october   from for the comparable prior period due primarily to these reduced carb marketing costs and the effect of certain fixed selling and marketing costs being incurred on reduced sales 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increase d million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million reported for the comparable period last year 
this is attributable primarily to increased costs of information technology  organization related costs  regulatory compliance costs and additional reserves for doubtful accounts related to specifically identified uncollectable accounts and customer deductions 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended october   from for th e year ended october  due to the effect of these relatively fixed costs being incurred on reduced sales 
provision for restructuring expense during the year ended october   million of restructuring expenses were recorded relating to the restructuring and rightsizing program announced in the third quarter of these expenses include employee severance and termination benefits  lease costs  supply agreement costs and other miscellaneous costs 
there were no such costs incurre d in fiscal year provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses for the year ended october   the provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses of million consisted of incremental costs associated with the brand acquisitions and plant start up costs related to the arizona facility 
there wa s no such expense in fiscal year operating profit operating profit for the fiscal year ended october   was million  a decrease of from the million reported for the fiscal year ended october  operating profit decreased as a percentage o f revenues to for the fiscal year ended october   from for the fiscal year ended october   as a result of the factors discussed above 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended october   was million  increasing from the million reported for the fiscal year ended october  the effect of higher interest rates and lowe r capitalized interest of million was partially offset by lower borrowings i n fiscal income tax expense income tax expense for the fiscal year ended october   was million  decreasing million from the million reporte d for the fiscal year ended october   and reflects effective income tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the reduced income tax provision and the lower effective rate in fiscal is primarily due to the effects of reduced taxable income and the foreign tax rate differential having a larger impact on the income tax provision in than the prior year 
net income net income for the fiscal year ended october   was million  decreasing from the million reported for the fiscal year ended october   as a result of the factors discussed above 
net income as a percentage of net revenues was versus in the prior year 
diluted earnings per common share were per share for the year ended october  compared to per share for the year ended october   also primarily due to the factors described above 
fiscal year ended october  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenues revenues increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ende d september  revenues increased million  or  due to volume growth  and million  or  due to higher average selling prices 
revenues declined by million  or  due to a reduction in payments received from the us government under the continued dumping and subsidy offse t act of revenues for are based on a week year  while revenues for were based on a week year 
revenues for the retail market increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended september  revenues increased million  or  due to volume growth  and million  or  due to higher average selling prices 
revenues declined by million  or  due to a reduction in payments received from the us government under the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of revenues for the institutional market increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million fo r the fiscal year ended september  revenues increased million  or  due to volume growth and million  or  due to higher average selling prices and changes in sales mix 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million for the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to revenue growt h associated with increased volumes and higher selling prices 
these increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs  principally durum wheat 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  from for the fiscal year ended september  this change in gross margin percentage is due to a number of offsetting factors factors putting downward pressure on margins included sales mix changes greate r growth in private label and ingredient versus branded  the inherent margin reduction that mathematically occurs with the pass through of durum cost increases  and lower net revenues associated with the department of commerce payments 
factors having a positive impact on gross margins included branded acquisitions  and lower costs resulting from the company s funding the growth cost reduction initiative  generally related to production and logistics costs 
selling and marketing expense selling and marketing expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million reported for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in selling and marketing relates primarily to our increased branded business 
selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenues decreased t o for the fiscal year ended october   from for the comparable prior period 
the lower selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenu e is attributable primarily to higher rates of revenue growth in the businesses which require less selling and marketing support  and the leverage benefits of controlling our overhead costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increase d million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended october   from million reported for the comparable period last year 
this is attributable primarily to increased mis cost  and the cost associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  including legal and insurance costs 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was for both periods 
provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses for the year ended october   the provision for acquisition and plant start up expenses of million consisted of incremental costs associated with the brand acquisitions and plant start up costs related to the arizona facility 
there were no such costs incurred in fiscal operating profit operating profit for the fiscal year ended october   was million  an increase of over the million reported for the fiscal year ended september  operating profit decreased as a percentag e of revenues to for the fiscal year ended october   from for the fiscal year ended september   as a result of the factors discussed above 
included in operating profit is the impact of the million charge fo r incremental costs associated with the acquisitions and plant start up expenses discussed above 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended october   was million  increasing from the million reported for the fiscal year ended september  the effect of higher borrowings and lower capitalized interest was partially offset by lower interest rates in fiscal income tax expense income tax expense for the fiscal year ended october   was million  decreasing million from the million reporte d for the fiscal year ended september   and reflects effective income tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
net income net income for the fiscal year ended october   was million  increasing from the million reported for the fiscal year ended september  included in net income is the impact of the million million after tax charge for incremental costs associated with the acquisitions and plant start up costs 
diluted earnings per common share were per share for the year ended october  compared to per share for the year ended september  included in the diluted earnings per share is the after tax per share effect of incremental costs related to acquisitions and plant start up costs 
net income as a percentage of net revenues was versus in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
cash and temporary investments totaled million and net working capital totaled million at october  at october   cash and temporary cash investments totaled million and working capital totaled million 
the million decrease in working capital in fiscal year relates primarily to the million decrease in inventory related to our inventory reduction strategy implemented with the restructuring and rightsizing program 
our net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the fiscal year ended october  compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  and million for the fiscal year ended september  cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to investments in production and distribution  milling and management information system assets and our branded product acquisitions related to golden grain mission and martha gooch larosa brands primarily in fiscal 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the higher capital spending in fiscal year and relates to the completion of the arizona facility 
net cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year the million of cash used in fiscal is primarily a result of million principal payment on debt and capital lease obligations  and the payment of million in dividends partially offset by million proceeds from issuance of debt 
the million of cash provided in fiscal is primarily a result of million proceeds from issuance of debt primarily to fund the brand acquisition s discussed above  offset by million principal payment on debt and capital lease obligations and million used to purchase treasury stock 
the million of cash provided in fiscal year is primarily a result of million proceeds from issuance of debt primarily to fund capital expenditures offset by million principal payment on debt and capital lease obligations we currently use cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures  repayment of debt  working capital requirements and dividend payments 
we expec t that future cash requirements will principally be the same 
at october   we had a million unsecured credit facility consisting of a million revolving credit facility including availability for issuanc e of letters of credit and a million term loan facility that was added in fiscal 
the million facility includes million dual currency availability in euros or us dollars to finance our international business in italy 
the facility provides for annual commitment reductions between october  and october  totaling million 
the credit facility matures on october  the total capacity of the credit facility was million as of october  and there were approximately million of borrowings available at that time 
at october   we had  of outstanding letters of credit 
in january  the credit facility was amended to increase the permitted restricted payments for dividends and for share repurchases  to million plu s of consolidated net income 
in addition  the amendment revised the maximum leverage ratio allowable under the original credit agreement 
with respect to previous amendments  there are no material differences between the terms of the original credit facility and the amended credit facility 
in june  the credit facility was further amended to revise the definitions of consolidated ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio and to increase the maximum leverage ratio and to decrease the minimum consolidated ebitda allowe d under the credit agreement 
other than as addressed above  with respect to previous amendments  there are no material differences between the terms of the original credit facility and the amended credit facility 
on november   our credit facility was further amended to revise the definitions of consolidated ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio and to increase the maximum leverage ratio and to decrease the minimum consolidated ebitda 
in addition  the lenders were granted a collateral interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible domestic assets 
other than as addressed above  with respect to previous amendments  there are no material differences between the terms of the original credit facility and the amended credit facility 
the principal maturity terms of our million revolving credit facility are as follows in thousands amount date scheduled commitment reduction  octobe r  scheduled commitment reduction  octobe r  scheduled commitment reduction  octobe r  scheduled commitment reduction  octobe r  final maturity  octobe r  interest is charged at libor euribor plus an applicable margin based on a sliding scale of the ratio of the company s total indebtedness divided by earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in addition  a commitment fee is charged on the unused facility balance based on the sliding scale of the company s total indebtedness divided by ebitda 
the stated interest per the credit facility plus the commitment fee is classified a s interest expense 
at october   the three month libor rate was  the three month euribor rate was  and our weighted average bank debt borrowing rate per the credit facility was 
the weighted average bank debt borrowing rate at october  was 
we expect interest costs to increase in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to increased libor rates  and the increased margin spread over libor under our credit agreement pursuant to the sliding scale discussed above that we expect to result from our decreased leve l of ebitda 
our credit agreement contains restrictive covenants which include  among other things  financial covenants requiring minimum and cumulative earnings levels an d limitations on the payment of dividends  stock purchases and our ability to enter into certain contractual arrangements 
we do not currently expect these limitations to have a material effect on business or results of operations 
pursuant to an amendment to the credit facility agreement on november   which modified certain financial covenants that were in effect in fiscal year  the company was in compliance with the restrictive covenants as of octobe r we utilize interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts to manage interest rate and foreign currency exposures 
the principal objective of such financial derivative contracts is to moderate the effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we  as a matter of policy  do not speculate in financial markets and therefore do not hold these contracts for trading purposes 
we utilize what are considered simple instruments  such as forward foreign exchange contracts and non leveraged interest rate swaps  to accomplish our objectives 
at this time  the current and projected borrowings under our credit facility do not exceed the facility s available commitment 
the facility matures on october  and we anticipate that any borrowings outstanding at that time will be refinanced 
we have no other material borrowing commitments 
we believe that net cash expected to be provided by operating activities and th e cash available through our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our expected capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

effect of inflation during fiscal years and  inflation did not have a material effect on our business 
in fiscal year  we experienced inflationary cost increases i n certain operating costs  including raw materials  utilities  freight  insurance and benefit costs 
the competitive environment in fiscal year did not allo w us to pass all of these cost increases to our customers or consumers through sales price increases 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
our business is dependent on several major customers 
historically  a limited number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues 
if our relationship with one or more of our major customers changes or ends  our sales could suffer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that we will continue to rely on a limited number of major customers for a substantial portion of our revenue s in the future 
during fiscal years  and  wal mart  inc accounted for approximately   and of our revenues  respectively  and sysco corporation accounted for approximately   and of our revenues  respectively  over the same periods 
we do not have long term supply agreements with a substantial number of our customers  including wal mart 
we have a mutually exclusive supply contract with sysco the sysco agreement that runs through december the sysco agreement may be terminated by sysco upon certain events  including a substantial casualty to or condemnation of our missouri plant 
under the sysco agreement  we are restricted from supplying pasta products to foodservice businesses other than sysco without sysco s consent 
if we are not able to successfully continue our relationship with sysco  our business would be materially and adversely affected 
our business is impacted by the economic environment 
as a result of the recent economic environment in this country  and due to the highly competitive environment currently existing in the food retailing and foodservice industries  some of our retail and foodservice customers have experienced economic difficulty 
a number of our customers have been forced to close stores and certain others have sought bankruptcy protection 
this trend could have a material adverse effect on us if a material number of our customers  or any one large customer  were to be forced to close a significant number of stores or file for bankruptcy protection 
as dry pasta is our only product line  any continued decline in demand for dry pasta could adversely affect us 
we focus exclusively on producing and selling dry pasta 
we expect to continue this focus 
because of our product concentration  any decline in consumer deman d or preference for dry pasta  such as diets focused on low carbohydrate foods  o r any other factor that adversely affects the pasta market  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant decline in retail demand for dry pasta products which adversely affected our profitability 
if demand continues to materially decline  we could experience additional material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if aggregate production capacity in the us pasta industry increases or is under utilized  we may have to adopt a more aggressive pricing strategy  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our competitive environment depends on the relationship between aggregate industry production capacity and aggregate market demand for pasta products 
production capacity above market demand can have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the latter part of fiscal year  we reduced our manufacturing capacity by suspending full operations at one our manufacturing facilities and one of our competitors closed one of their plants 
as a result  we believe ther e have recently been sizeable capacity reductions in the pasta industry as compared to a year earlier 
our pricing strategy in fiscal year is to increase sales prices  primarily in our private label and ingredient businesses which we believe we will be able to achieve while increasing our overall profitability as industry capacity has been significantly reduced for these product areas 
the market for pasta products is highly competitive  and we face competition from many established domestic and foreign producers 
we may not be able to compete effectively with these producers 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete against numerous well established national  regional  local and foreign companies in every aspect of our business 
our customers may not continue to buy our product s and we may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than we do 
our direct competitors include barilla  a large multi national  italian owned company wit h manufacturing facilities in the us and us producers such as new world past a llc  dakota growers pasta company  philadelphia macaroni co 
inc and a 
zerega s sons  inc  each an independent producer 
we also compete against food processors such as kraft foods  general mills  conagra  campbell soup company and stouffers corp  that produce pasta internally as an ingredient for use in food products 
we also compete with italian producers such as de cecco and italian food processors 
in we commenced operations in italy to produce pasta to sell in the us  the united kingdom  continental europe and other international markets 
competition in these international markets is also intense and comes primarily from major italian pasta companies such as de cecco and barilla  and from several locally recognized producers 
we have significantly more experience in us markets than in european markets and we have not been  and we may not be  able to achieve a significant presence in european markets 
we must manage our production and inventory levels in order to operate cost effectively and to maintain high customer service standards 
unanticipated fluctuations in demand make it difficult to manage production schedules  plant operations and inventories 
also  customer inventory managemen t systems that are intended to reduce a retailer s inventory investment increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a portion of the retailer s inventory management cost to the supplier 
any production of excess inventory to meet anticipated demand could result in markdowns and increased inventory carrying costs 
any temporary plant suspensions or shutdowns may cause inventory shortfalls 
in addition  if we underestimate the demand for our products  we may be unable to provide adequate supplies of pasta products to retailers in a timely fashion  and may consequently lose sales 
if product availability issues result in our not maintaining high customer service standards  our customers may not continue to purchase our products 
in fiscal year  we experienced significant declines in demand resulting from what we believe to be the impact of consumer s dietary trends towards lowe r carbohydrate intake 
we also introduced new low and reduced carb product lines for which we produced inventory in excess of customer acceptance 
we incurred significant costs relating to the implementation of our restructuring and rightsizing program and the transition also negatively impacted our production efficiency and manufacturing costs 
some short term product availability shortages resulted late in fiscal as a result of the transition inefficiencies and related effects on inventory levels 
our business requires substantial capital and we carry a significant amount of debt that restrict our operating and financial flexibility 
our business requires a substantial capital investment  which we have historically financed through third party lenders and public equity offerings 
as of october   we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding 
the amount of debt we carry and the terms of our indebtedness coul d adversely affect us in several ways  including o our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate purposes  including strategic acquisitions  may be impaired  o our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business may be limited because a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may have to be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness  o the terms of such indebtedness may restrict our ability to continue t o pay dividends  o we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage  o the level of debt we carry could restrict our corporate activities  including our ability to respond to competitive market conditions  to provide for capital expenditures beyond those permitted by our loan agreements  o r to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and grow our business  and o because substantially all of our assets are now pledged as collateral for our debt  an uncured default could allow our lenders to sell our assets to satisfy our debt obligations 
in the event that we fail to comply with the covenants in our credit facility  as amended on november   or any future loan agreements  there could be a n event of default under the applicable instrument 
as a result  all amounts outstanding under our current or any future debt instruments may become immediately due and payable 
we have used  and may continue to use  interest rate protection agreements covering our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to variable rates 
however  we may not be able to enter into such agreements or such agreements ma y adversely affect our financial performance  as was the case in fiscal years  and if interest rates were to significantly increase or if we are unable to generat e sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may not be able to service our debt and may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt  structure our debt differently  obtain additional financing or sell assets to repay such debt 
we may not be able to affect such refinancing  additional financing or asset sales on favorable terms or at all 
if existing anti dumping measures imposed against certain foreign imports terminate  we will face increased competition from foreign companies that are subsidized by their governments and could sell their products at significantly lower prices than we  which could negatively affect our profit margins or marke t shares 
anti dumping and countervailing duties on italian and turkish imports imposed b y the us department of commerce in may enable us and our domestic competitors to compete more favorably against italian and turkish producers in the us pasta market 
if these duties are not maintained  or foreign producers sell competing products in the united states at prices lower than ours or enter the us market by establishing production facilities in the united states  thi s would further increase competition in the us pasta market 
we may be unable t o compete effectively with these competitors 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to regain our historical growth rate 
until fiscal  we had grown our revenues and unit volumes rapidly over the prior years 
this growth came primarily from gaining market share at the expens e of our competitors and expansion through acquisitions 
we do not expect to be able to grow our business at the rates we have experienced in the past 
cost increases or crop shortages in durum wheat or cost increases in packaging materials could adversely affect us 
the costs of durum wheat and packaging materials have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
increases in the cost of duru m wheat or packaging materials could have a material adverse effect on our operating profit and margins unless and until we are able to pass the increased cost along to our customers 
historically  changes in sale prices of our pasta products have lagged changes in our materials costs 
competitive pressures may also limit our ability to raise prices in response to increased raw or packagin g material costs 
accordingly  we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to offset durum wheat or packaging material cost increases with increased product prices 
the principal raw material in our products is durum wheat 
during fiscal and  the cost of durum wheat represented more than of our total cost o f goods sold 
durum wheat is used almost exclusively in pasta production and is a narrowly traded  cash only commodity crop 
our commodity procurement and pricin g practices are intended to reduce the risk of durum wheat cost increases on our profitability  but by doing so we may temporarily affect our ability to benefit from possible durum wheat cost decreases 
the supply and price of durum wheat is subject to market conditions and is influenced by several factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  natural disasters and weather conditions  competition  trade relations  and governmental programs and regulations 
the supply  quantity  and cost of durum wheat may also be adversely affected by insects  plant diseases  and weather conditions 
we also rely on the supply of plastic  corrugated and other packaging materials  which fluctuate in price due to marke t conditions beyond our control 
during fiscal years and  the cost of packaging materials represented less than of our total cost of goods sold 
the costs associated with any strategic acquisitions we make may outweigh the benefits we expect to receive from the acquired business or assets 
since november  we have completed three significant brand acquisitions for aggregate consideration of approximately million  plus additional  smaller acquisitions 
the integration process of these and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen difficulties and could require significant time and attention from our management that would otherwise be directed at developing ou r existing business 
in addition  we could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which we may become responsible 
further  the benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions may not develop 
for example  our acquisition of the mueller s pasta brand  the golden grain mission pasta brand or the seven pasta brands we acquired from borden foods or the integration of those brands into our existing business may not be successful  o r yield the expected benefits to us or may adversely affect our business 
we may acquire additional pasta brands or other pasta related businesses  products or processes 
if we cannot do so cost effectively  our business and financial results may be adversely affected 
our future growth rate depends in part on our acquisition of additional pasta brands or other pasta related businesses  products or processes consistent with stated strategy 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisitions available for purchase or be able to make acquisitions at favorable prices 
in addition  if w e do successfully identify and complete acquisitions in the future  the acquisitions may involve the following risks o increases in our debt and contingent liabilities  o entering geographic markets in which we have little or no direct prio r experience  o unanticipated or undiscovered legal liabilities or other obligations of acquired businesses  and o the integration of acquired businesses into our existing business may not be successful 
a write off of our intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations 
our total assets reflect substantial intangible assets 
a determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of our intangible assets would have a material negative effect on our results of operations and total capitalization 
at october   intangible assets totaled million compared to million of stockholders equity 
the intangibles represent the value of our brands and trademarks resulting primarily from our acquisition s of the mueller s and golden grain mission brands and the seven pasta brands fro m borden foods 
annually  we review long lived assets for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asse t may not be recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and use d by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be dispose d of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
if future operating performance of one or more of our acquired brands wer e to fall significantly below current or expected levels  we would reflect  under current applicable accounting rules  a non cash charge to operations for impairment of intangible assets 
because we produce food products  we may be subject to product liability claims and have costs related to product recalls 
we may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated  infested or misbranded 
we may also be subject to claims or lawsuits if the consumption of any of our products causes injury 
a widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment against us could cause products to be unavailable for a period of time and a loss of consumer confidence in our food products and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we carry insurance against most of these matters  however  our insurance coverage may no t be adequate 
the cost of commercially available insurance has increased significantly and such insurance may not be available in the future at prices that we can afford 
in addition  because we often indemnify our customers for costs related to product recalls  we could be subject to additional expenses an d any significant expenses not covered by insurance would negatively impact our operating results 
our success is dependent on the efforts of several key executives 
our operations and prospects depend in large part on the performance of our senior management team 
the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to find qualified replacements for any of these individuals if their services were no longer available 
we do not currently maintain key person life insurance on any of our key employees 
we do  however  have employment agreements with horst schroeder  timothy webster  daniel trott  george shadid  warren schmidgall  walter george  jerry dear  and other officers 
our business could be subject to technological obsolescence 
if other pasta producers acquire equipment similar to our equipment or more advanced equipment that provides greater efficiencies  what we believe to be ou r current competitive advantage might be diminished or eliminated  potentially causing pressure on profit margins or reducing our market shares 
erosion of this advantage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
disruptions in transportation of raw materials or finished products or increase s in transportation costs could adversely affect our financial results 
durum wheat is shipped to our production facilities in missouri and south carolina directly from north dakota  montana and canada under long term rail contracts 
under these agreements  we are obligated to transport specified whea t volumes and  in the event we do not  we must reimburse the carrier for certain of its costs 
we also have a rail contract to ship semolina  milled and processed at the missouri facility  to our south carolina facility 
an extended interruption in our ability to ship durum wheat by railroad to the missouri or south carolina plants  or semolina to our south carolina facility  could cause us to incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with th e distribution of our pasta to our customers 
if we are unable to provide adequat e supplies of pasta products to our customers in a timely fashion due to such delays  we may subsequently lose sales 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  continued increases in transportation costs of our finished products  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our international expansion efforts may not be successful 
we completed the construction of a pasta producing facility in italy in prior to opening this plant  we had no experience in operating or distributing products on an international basis 
we also do not have the same competitive advantages in these overseas markets that we do in the us our international efforts may not be successful 
we incur significant costs in o establishing international distribution networks  o complying with local regulations  o overseeing the distribution of products in foreign markets  and o modifying our business and accounting processing system for each international market we enter 
if our international revenues continue to be inadequate to offset the expense o f establishing and maintaining foreign operations  our business and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  there are several risks inherent in doing business on an international level 
these risks include o export and import restrictions  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates and inflation risks  o seasonal fluctuations in business activity in other parts of the world  o changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  o potentially adverse tax consequences  and o difficulty in securing or transporting raw materials or transporting finished product 
any of these risks could adversely impact the success of our international operations 
our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we are unable to protec t our intellectual property 
our brand trademarks are important to our success and our competitive position 
our actions to establish and protect our brand trademarks and other proprietary rights may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our products by others 
moreover  we may face claims by a third party that we violate their intellectua l property rights 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful could result in substantial cost  divert management s time and attention from our core business  and harm our reputation 
our operations are subject to significant government and environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal  state  and other governmental agencies relating to the operation of our production facilities  the production  packaging  labeling and marketing of our products and pollution control  including air emissions 
any determination by the fda or other agencies that our facilities are not in compliance with applicable regulations could interfere with the continued manufacture and distribution of the affected products  up to the entire output of the facility or facilities involved  and  in some cases  might also require the recall of previously distributed products 
any such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under environmental laws  we are exposed to liability primarily as an owner and operator of real property  and as such  we may be responsible for the clean up or other remediation of contaminated property 
environmental laws and regulations can change rapidly and we may become subject to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future that may be retroactively applied to earlier events 
in addition  compliance with more stringent environmental laws and regulations could involve significant capital investments 
additional information is provided in this form k under the heading business governmental regulation  environmental matters 
we currently pay dividends to shareholders but we have no obligation to continue 
we began paying quarterly dividends in fiscal year we anticipate that future earnings will be used principally to fund capital expenditures  repaymen t of debt  working capital requirements and dividend payments 
payment of dividends is restricted by provisions in our credit facility 
dividend amounts  if any  will be determined by our board 
our board will consider a number of factors  including our financial condition  capital requirements  funds generated from operations  future business prospects  applicable contractual restrictions and any other factors our board may deem relevant 
there can be no assurance that dividend payments will continue in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk associated with financial instruments relates to interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with borrowings and purchases from foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency 
we occasionally utilize simple derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to manage our mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
we had various fixed interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million outstanding at october  the estimated fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was million and approximates the amount we would be required to pay to terminate the swap agreements at october  if interest rates for our long term debt under our credit facility had averaged more and the full amount available under our credit facility had been outstanding for the entire year  our interest expense would have increased  and income before taxes would have decreased by million for the fiscal year ended october  at october   we had a net investment in our italy operations of euro million million 
we hedge our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries with euro borrowings under our credit facility in the us at october   long term debt includes obligations of euro million million 
interest on our euro debt is at variable rates and based on euribor market rates 
changes in the us dollar equivalent of euro based borrowings are recorded as a component of the net foreign currency translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of stockholder s equity 
the functional currency for our italy operations is the euro 
our net annual transactional exposure is approximately euro million million 
we have transactional exposure to various other european currencies  primarily the british pound 
we frequently use forward purchase contracts to hedge this exposure 
at october   we have outstanding forward contracts of euro million and pound million
