item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion  including the summary and outlook  contains statements about our future financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from these predictions 
in evaluating these statements  you should review the section of this report entitled cautionary and forward looking statements 
summary and outlook the year marked a significant change at boise 
we sharply accelerated our strategy to grow our distribution channels by acquiring officemax  inc  a billion sales office products retailer 
and we announced our intent to evaluate strategic alternatives for our paper and building products businesses 
financial performance in  sales grew to billion 
net income was million  or a loss of cents per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or a loss of cents per diluted share  in in  net income included a million pretax charge for the cost reduction program  a million one time tax benefit related to a favorable tax ruling  a million pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington  and the effects of the officemax acquisition 
in  net income included a loss for the sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary that held our investment in identitynow  net of tax effects 
before these items  our financial performance improved over last year 
boise building solutions sharply stronger financial results before these items drove the improved performance of the company overall 
before these items  operating income for boise office solutions was similar to results  while boise paper solutions posted a loss for the year  down from its performance in virtually all of the improvement in boise s results  before the items described above  occurred in the second half of the year 
during the first half  continued economic weakness  higher pension costs  higher energy costs  and business disruptions from severe winter weather in the eastern united states negatively affected our financial results 
in response to these conditions  we announced in march measures to reduce operating costs by approximately million  net of severance costs  and to hold capital spending to approximately million  before acquisitions 
we reduced overall costs by freezing salaries  severely restricting hiring  reducing discretionary spending at all levels of the company  and eliminating approximately job positions 
because of these cost controls  our general and administrative expenses  as a percent of sales  decreased in  compared with  in spite of higher pension  healthcare  and benefit expenses 
while some of these negative factors remained true throughout  other more positive trends led to much stronger performance in boise building solutions in the second half 
continued strong housing starts  low interest rates  and pent up demand following weather related business disruptions in the first half combined to generate very strong building products markets in the third and fourth quarters 
prices for our major grades of structural panels reached record levels 
delivered log costs also declined for the year 
sales volume for our building materials distribution business grew  reaching record levels 
sales volume for our engineered wood products also increased  but margins were hampered by high prices for raw materials 
due to continued weakness in the paper industry in  weighted average prices for the grades of paper produced by boise showed little improvement over s low levels 
despite an increase in the volume of office paper sold through boise office solutions  boise paper solutions sales volume declined because of increased market related curtailment  compared with in addition  unit manufacturing costs  especially chemical and fiber costs  increased from year earlier levels 
boise office solutions experienced a gradual recovery during from the us economic downturn and the resulting loss of white collar jobs 
sales for locations operating in both and improved slightly  but margins continued to be under pressure due to intense industry competition 
acquisition of officemax on december   we acquired officemax  inc we paid officemax shareholders billion for the acquisition  paying of the purchase price in boise common stock and in cash 
the acquisition more than doubled the size of boise office solutions to approximately billion pro forma sales 
with the acquisition  office products distribution now generates approximately two thirds of total company sales 
the acquisition enhances boise office solutions competitive position by allowing it to achieve competitive purchasing scale  serve all customer segments through all channels  and significantly improve its cost structure 
we also expect to achieve from the officemax acquisition annual synergy benefits of million by  as outlined below annualized savings margin improvement millions boise office solutions purchasing leverage elimination of duplicate facilities and administrative functions shared marketing functions and officemax brand leverage boise paper solutions increased paper sales to boise office solutions productivity and efficiency enhancements boise expects to achieve in million of the million of synergies claimed as a result of the acquisition  offset in part by approximately million of integration and related costs 
strategic alternatives given the scale of the officemax acquisition  we announced in july that we would undertake a review of the strategic direction of the company as a whole by exploring strategic alternatives for our paper and building products businesses 
we retained goldman  sachs co 
to assist in evaluating and executing potential transactions 
we are considering restructurings  divestitures  spinoffs  and or other business combinations as well as the possibility of making no changes at all 
we expect this process  which began in december  to take to months 
cash generated by potential transactions  if any  will be used to pay down debt 
outlook setting aside potential impacts of our strategic review  boise s sales and income should increase substantially in  primarily as a result of the officemax acquisition 
with the acquisition of officemax  boise office solutions should more than double sales and operating income should increase significantly in  relative to assuming that the us economy continues to grow and white collar employment rises as anticipated  same location sales growth should continue to be positive 
however  operating margins will be lower in than in as we integrate the lower margin retail business into our operations 
progress by boise office solutions in achieving synergies will be aided by closures of officemax retail stores by the end of second quarter  rationalization of us delivery warehouses from at year end to to by  and consolidation of us customer service centers and outbound sales centers from eight to six  by we expect another good year for boise building solutions in housing starts have continued to be strong in recent months  and interest rates are low 
panel and lumber prices in january were well above january levels 
these factors suggest continuing strong demand for wood products  although the timing and strength of the building season are difficult to predict 
we expect to continue to grow our building materials distribution business  which surpassed billion in sales in  and our engineered wood products business  which likewise grew rapidly last year 
however  unit sales volumes in our building materials manufacturing business should decline in due to the reduction in plywood and lumber capacity that resulted from the sale of our yakima  washington  facilities in february the very difficult year boise paper solutions experienced in should be a cyclical low point 
we anticipate that a cyclical recovery will begin this year 
white collar employment should increase  which will lead to improved office paper demand  and a weak us dollar should discourage paper imports 
over the course of the year  we expect boise paper solutions to return to posting positive quarterly operating income 
its performance in will be aided by a significant increase in boise office papers sold through boise office solutions 
the increase from  tons in to approximately  tons in will come mostly from selling boise office papers through the acquired officemax stores 
in addition  the business plans to further grow its production of value added uncoated free sheet grades  particularly label  release  and security papers 
acquisition of officemax on december   we completed our acquisition of officemax  inc officemax is now a subsidiary of boise cascade corporation  and the results of officemax operations after december   are included in our consolidated financial statements 
officemax is a retail distributor of office supplies and paper  technology products  and office furniture 
our officemax superstores feature copymax and furnituremax in store modules devoted to print for pay services and office furniture 
officemax has operations in the united states  puerto rico  the us virgin islands  and a owned joint venture in mexico 
growing our distribution businesses has been a part of our long term strategy for many years 
the acquisition of officemax is a major step in advancing that strategy 
the acquisition more than doubles the size of our office products business 
combining officemax s retail expertise and strong brand with our contract office products segment s strength in serving contract customers will allow the combined office products business to better serve our customers across all distribution channels  meeting the needs of every market segment 
the acquisition creates opportunities for synergies that will come from offering more products and services across more customer segments  purchasing leverage from increased scale  and reduced costs in logistics  marketing  and administration 
the aggregate consideration paid for the acquisition was as follows millions fair value of boise common stock issued cash consideration for officemax common shares exchanged transaction costs debt assumed by boise we paid officemax shareholders billion for the acquisition  paying of the purchase price in boise common stock and in cash 
officemax shareholders had the opportunity to elect to receive cash or stock for their officemax shares 
each shareholder s election was subject to proration  depending on the elections of all officemax shareholders 
as a result of this proration  officemax shareholders electing boise stock received approximately 
share of boise stock and in cash for each of their officemax shares 
fractional shares were paid in cash 
officemax shareholders electing cash or who had no consideration preference  as well as those shareholders who made no effective election  received in cash for each of their officemax shares 
after the proration  the billion paid to officemax shareholders consisted of million in cash and the issuance of million of boise common shares valued at million 
the value of the common shares issued was determined based on the average market price of our common shares over a ten day trading period before the acquisition closed on december  pro forma financial information the following table summarizes unaudited pro forma financial information assuming the officemax acquisition had occurred on january  and officemax s fiscal year ended on the saturday prior to the last wednesday in january 
the unaudited pro forma financial information uses officemax data for the months corresponding to boise s december year end 
this unaudited pro forma financial information does not necessarily represent what would have occurred if the transaction had taken place on the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of our future consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have not finalized our integration plans 
accordingly  this pro forma information does not include all costs related to the integration 
when the costs are determined  they will either increase the amount of goodwill recorded or decrease net income  depending on the nature of the costs 
we also expect to realize operating synergies 
synergies will come from offering more products and services across more customer segments  purchasing leverage from increased scale  and reduced costs in logistics  marketing  and administration

facility closures prior to our acquisition of officemax  officemax had identified and closed underperforming facilities 
as part of our purchase price allocation  we recorded million of reserves for the estimated fair value of future liabilities associated with these closures 
we recorded million in other long term liabilities and million in accrued liabilities  other in our consolidated balance sheet 
these reserves related primarily to future lease termination costs  net of estimated sublease income 
in addition to these store closures and in connection with the officemax acquisition  we reviewed the stores we acquired and identified facilities that are no longer strategically or economically viable 
we expect to close these stores by the end of second quarter  eliminating approximately  employee positions 
approximately people will be offered transfers to other stores 
in identifying stores to be closed  we evaluated their market and financial performance and lease terms 
in the store closing analysis  we considered several factors  including historical and projected operating results  anticipated impact of current and future competition  future lease liability and real estate value  size  and capital spending requirements 
in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  we recorded million of store closure reserves in other long term liabilities and million in accrued liabilities  other 
these reserves included million of lease termination costs  net of estimated sublease income  and million of other closure costs  primarily severance 
these charges were accounted for as exit activities in connection with the acquisition  and we did not recognize a charge to income in our consolidated statement of income 
most of the cash expenditures for these closed stores will be made over the remaining lives of the operating leases  which range from one month to years 
we have not completed our integration plans for the acquired business 
we have one year from the purchase date to develop our integration plans and adjust for changes in estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we are evaluating the combined office products business to determine what opportunities for additional consolidation of operations may be appropriate 
for example  we are developing plans for the rationalization of us delivery warehouses from at year end to to by and consolidation of us customer service centers and outbound sales centers from eight to six  by when the costs are determined  they will either increase the amount of goodwill recorded or decrease net income  depending on the nature of the costs 
we will record the costs of additional closures in segment discussion we have historically reported our business results using four reportable segments boise office solutions  boise building solutions  boise paper solutions  and corporate and other 
in december  we acquired officemax  inc after this acquisition in boise office solutions  our office products business  we began reporting boise office solutions as two separate reportable segments  boise office solutions  contract  and boise office solutions  retail 
material increases in balance sheet items  such as inventories  goodwill  accounts payable  and debt  are primarily due to this acquisition 
boise office solutions  contract  markets and sells office supplies and paper  technology products  and office furniture through field salespeople  catalogs  the internet  and stores 
boise office solutions  retail  markets and sells office supplies and paper  technology products  and office furniture through office supply superstores 
these superstores feature copymax and furnituremax in store modules devoted to print for pay services and office furniture 
boise building solutions manufactures  markets  and distributes various products that are used for construction  while boise paper solutions manufactures  markets  and distributes uncoated free sheet papers  containerboard  corrugated containers  newsprint  and market pulp 
corporate and other includes support staff services and related assets and liabilities

percentage of sales materials  labor  and other operating expenses selling and distribution expenses general and administrative expenses operating results compared with total sales in increased billion  or 
the increase in sales resulted from billion of sales from the officemax retail business  a billion increase in sales in our contract office products segment  which included days of sales from the officemax contract business  and an additional billion of sales by our boise building solutions segment  offset by a slight decline in boise paper solutions sales 
total sales and same location sales in our contract office products segment increased and from levels 
excluding the sales contributed by the officemax contract business and the effect of favorable foreign exchange rates  same location sales were up 
boise building solutions sales increased because of higher structural panel prices  increased building materials distribution sales due to increased commodity prices and volume  and increased engineered wood products sales due primarily to increased volume 
boise paper solutions sales decreased  primarily because of a decrease in sales volume 
for more information about our segment results  see the discussion of each segment below 
in  materials  labor  and other operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales  compared with effective january   we adopted an accounting change for vendor allowances to comply with the guidelines issued by the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
under eitf  consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the cost of the vendor s products or services  unless it is for a specific incremental cost to sell the product 
as a result  approximately million of vendor allowances reduced materials  labor  and other operating expenses that previously would have been recognized primarily as a reduction of selling and distribution expenses 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  prior period financial statements have not been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 
before the accounting change and excluding the effects of the officemax operations  materials  labor  and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly because of lower sales and increased unit manufacturing costs in boise paper solutions  partially offset by favorable wood costs in boise building solutions 
selling and distribution expenses increased as a percentage of sales in  compared with before the accounting change and excluding the effects of the officemax operations  selling and distribution expenses increased only slightly  primarily due to higher pension  healthcare  and benefit expenses 
due to cost controls  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales in spite of higher pension  healthcare  and benefit expenses 
other income expense  net increased to million in from million in the year ended december   included a million pretax loss for the sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary that held our investment in identitynow and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
for more information  see note  other income expense  net  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k 
in  other income expense  net included a million pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington for more information  see the boise building solutions section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and million of acquisition costs incurred in connection with the officemax acquisition 
in addition  other income expense  net included a million pretax charge for employee related costs incurred in connection with our cost reduction program 
as part of this program  we reduced operating costs  net of severance costs 
we took these actions because of higher pension costs  higher energy costs  business disruptions from severe winter weather in the eastern united states  and global political uncertainty 
we reduced operating costs by freezing salaries  restricting hiring  reducing discretionary spending at all levels of the company  and eliminating approximately positions 
we are eliminating these positions by terminating approximately employees and leaving vacant positions unfilled 
at december   we had terminated approximately employees 
under our severance policy  we recorded a pretax charge of million for employee related costs in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of income 
we recorded these costs in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
we recorded million in the boise office solutions  contract  segment  million in the boise paper solutions segment  and million in our corporate and other segment 
employee related costs are primarily for severance payments  most of which were paid in  with the remainder to be paid in this item decreased net income million for the year ended december  the reserve liability for the cost reduction program is included in accrued liabilities  other in the consolidated balance sheet 
reserve liability activity related to the charge is as follows employee related costs millions expense recorded charges against reserve balance at december  equity in net income loss of affiliates was million and million in and  respectively 
the variance was due to increased equity in earnings of voyageur panel  in which we have a interest and for which we account under the equity method 
the increased equity in earnings of voyageur panel resulted from oriented strand board osb prices that were higher  on average  in than in we also recognized no losses in from our investment in identitynow  which we sold in may interest expense was million in and million in the variance was due to incremental interest expense directly related to additional borrowings in the fourth quarter to provide cash for the officemax acquisition 
excluding the incremental interest expense directly related to the officemax acquisition  interest expense declined year over year  primarily due to lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our effective tax provision rate for the year ended december   was  compared with an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  in  we recorded million of tax benefits related to the million pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington  million of tax benefits related to the million pretax charge for the cost reduction program  and a million gain  which included a one time tax benefit related to a favorable tax ruling  net of changes in other tax items 
in  we recorded a million pretax loss for the sale of the stock of our wholly owned subsidiary that held our investment in identitynow and million of tax benefits associated with this sale and our previous write down 
before recording these items and before the impact of the officemax acquisition  our estimated tax provision rates for the years ended december  and  were and 
the difference between the estimated tax provision rates before these items was due to the sensitivity of the rate to changing income levels and the mix of domestic and foreign sources of income 
in  the million recorded in cumulative effect of accounting changes  net of income tax consisted of an after tax charge of million  or cents per share  for the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which affects the way we account for landfill closure costs 
this statement requires us to record an asset and a liability discounted for estimated closure and closed site monitoring costs and to depreciate the asset over the landfill s expected useful life 
previously  we accrued for the closure costs over the life of the landfill and expensed monitoring costs as incurred 
we also recorded an after tax charge of million  or cents per share  for the adoption of eitf eitf requires that vendor allowances reside in inventory with the product and be recognized when the product is sold  changing the timing of our recognition of these items and creating a one time  noncash  cumulative effect adjustment 
compared with total sales in were essentially flat with sales 
boise building solutions sales increased  primarily because of stronger sales in engineered wood products and building materials distribution  while boise paper solutions sales decreased because of lower product prices 
boise office solutions sales and same location sales were flat 
in  materials  labor  and other operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales  compared with  because of increased sales of lower margin products in boise office solutions and lower paper prices in boise paper solutions  partially offset by lower manufacturing costs in our paper business and favorable wood and manufacturing costs in boise building solutions 
selling and distribution expenses as a percentage of sales were flat in  compared with  due primarily to cost control and productivity improvements in boise office solutions 
in  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales  compared with  due to higher compensation and benefits costs 
in accordance with new accounting standards  we stopped amortizing goodwill january  amortization of goodwill in was million after taxes 
the increase in interest expense was attributable to million of distributions on our adjustable conversion rate equity security units in  compared with million in before the distributions  interest expense declined due to decreases in our debt levels during the year and  to a lesser degree  changes in interest rates 
our effective tax benefit rate in was  compared with an effective tax benefit rate of in these unusual tax benefit rates were due to the timing of the recognition of tax benefits associated with the sale and write down of our investment in identitynow 
under income tax accounting rules  in  we were able to recognize a tax benefit of only million related to our million write down in that year 
in contrast  in  we were able to recognize a tax benefit of million associated with the sale of our remaining investment in identitynow and our previous write down 
in addition  in  we recorded a pretax charge of million related to the permanent closure of our plywood and lumber operations in emmett  idaho  and our sawmill in cascade  idaho  a million pretax charge to accrue for a one time liability related to postretirement benefits for our northwest hourly paperworkers  a million charge for the write off of assets in chile  and million of pretax income for the reversal of unneeded reserves for potential claims rising from the sale in of our european office products operations 
before these items  our effective tax provision rates were about and for and the increase in the tax provision rate  compared with the tax provision rate  was due primarily to our charitable donation in of surplus property in vancouver  washington  for which we received a tax benefit 
changes in our tax rates were also due to lower income levels and the mix of domestic and foreign sources of income

the officemax contract business includes sales generated by officemax s field salespeople  catalogs  and e commerce business 
total sales and same location sales increased and in  compared with within product categories  the greatest sales growth occurred in office furniture and technology products  up and  compared with a year ago 
these categories represent approximately of overall sales 
sales of office supplies and paper  our largest category  grew 
excluding the benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates and the sales from the officemax contract business  total sales and same location sales increased 
when excluding the same items  the greatest sales growth within product categories occurred in office furniture and technology products  up and  while office supplies and paper experienced a modest decline  compared with a year ago 
the shift in mix toward furniture and technology products was evident in each quarter of and is reflective of an improving economy  focused sales efforts  and in the case of technology products  changing buying patterns of our customers 
boise office solutions  contract  sold  tons of boise office paper in  a increase over volume 
the combined boise office solutions  which comprises our contract and retail segments  expects to sell approximately  tons of boise office paper in e commerce sales in our contract office products segment increased over and represented of the segment s worldwide sales 
e commerce transactions resulted in nearly billion of revenue for boise office solutions  contract  in in  our gross margin increased  compared with however  the gross margin reflects the results of the officemax contract business and the effect of the vendor allowance accounting change for eitf discussed above 
excluding the margin related to the officemax contract business and the effect of adopting eitf  our gross margin was  the same as in in  our operating expenses were of sales  compared with in operating expenses for the contract office products segment in included the expenses of the officemax contract business  including integration costs  million for the vendor allowance classification change  and million of employee related costs for our cost reduction program 
before these items  our operating expenses increased only  compared with  due primarily to higher pension  healthcare  and benefit expenses 
in  segment income decreased  compared with excluding the results of the officemax contract business  integration costs  and the employee related charge for our cost reduction program  segment income declined 
the decline was primarily attributable to higher pension  healthcare  and benefit expenses 
compared with segment sales and same location sales were essentially flat in  primarily the result of the sluggish us economy 
customers were more cost conscious in their office products and furniture purchases  and widespread white collar layoffs caused our customers to use fewer office products in our contract office products business saw signs of the business beginning to gradually recover during the second half of the year  as quarterly same location sales  compared with the prior year  were negative in the first half and turned positive in the second half of in  segment income decreased from that reported in  as did operating profit as a percentage of sales 
our gross profit margins decreased because sales of higher margin furniture and office supplies decreased 
paper margins also narrowed in  as the price we paid for paper increased more quickly than the price we charged our customers 
year over year  our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased  primarily as a result of cost controls and productivity improvements that more than offset increased pension and employee medical expenses 
operating expenses were also reduced  to a lesser extent  by eliminating amortization of goodwill january  amortization of goodwill totaled approximately million  before taxes  for this segment in our contract office products business sold  tons of boise office papers in  an increase of over we also continued to build our sales to us medium sized businesses offices with approximately to employees  sales increased from to gross profit margins on sales to this sector are generally better than those on sales to larger corporate and government offices 
boise office solutions also increased us e commerce sales 
e commerce technology provides convenience for our customers while reducing our cost of operations

operating results compared with during the second half of  our building products business enjoyed one of the strongest building seasons ever  following a slow start in the first half of due to wet weather 
boise building solutions sales grew in  compared with the previous year 
structural panel prices rose 
building materials distribution sales increased due to strong pricing coupled with an increase in physical sales volume 
during  about of building materials distribution s lumber  panel  and engineered wood product sales were from products manufactured by boise 
sales of engineered wood products laminated veneer lumber  wood i joists  and laminated beams increased  due to increased sales volume 
after a long  wet  and cold spring  especially in the eastern united states  the building season got underway late in the second quarter and held strong through the first two months of fourth quarter as a result of increased demand from housing construction  prices for our major grades of structural panels reached record levels 
relative to  average plywood prices and sales volume increased and  respectively 
in contrast  average prices and volumes for our mix of lumber products  which is mostly ponderosa pine appearance and industrial grades  declined 
an unfavorable balance of supply and demand for pine lumber during the first half of the year pushed prices down until late in the third and fourth quarters  which delayed recovery in these grades until later in the year 
in december  we recorded a million pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington 
we also recorded million of tax benefits associated with the write down 
the write down resulted from our internal review of the operations and indications of current market value 
we recorded the write down in other income expense  net and the tax benefits in income tax provision benefit in the consolidated statement of income 
for the year ended december   the write down decreased net income million 
in february  we sold the yakima operations  excluding timberlands 
the impact of this sale was not material to our financial position or to our results of operations 
in  we began construction of a new facility near elma  washington  to manufacture integrated wood polymer building materials 
the plant has had a very difficult start up  in part due to the plant s unique manufacturing processes 
while product quality has met our expectations  production has not reached anticipated levels 
compared with  segment results included million of additional losses from operations 
we recently announced that we would temporarily discontinue production at the facility to allow us to make the technical improvements necessary to increase production levels 
we are not able to predict how long these improvements may take or at what time shipments of product will resume 
voyageur panel  a joint venture in barwick  ontario  canada  has the capacity to produce million square feet of osb panels annually 
we hold of the equity 
we have an agreement with voyageur panel under which we operate the plant and market its product 
our investment in this venture was million and million at december  and a canadian forest products manufacturer and two insurance companies own the remaining equity interest 
we account for the joint venture under the equity method 
accordingly  segment results do not include the joint venture s sales but do include million of equity in earnings in and million and million of equity in losses in and at december   the debt of this affiliate  which was issued without recourse to us  totaled million 
during  voyageur panel paid the debt balance in full 
the other shareholders have the right to require voyageur panel to buy their equity interests at fair market value 
we have the right to buy any shares sold back to voyageur panel before they are sold to other investors 
together with the other shareholders  we are considering the potential sale of our interests in voyageur panel 
segment income increased million in  compared with  due primarily to increased structural panel prices  increased building materials distribution sales  and favorable wood costs  offset by a pretax charge for the write down of impaired assets at our plywood and lumber operations in yakima  washington  and additional losses from operations incurred at our integrated wood polymer building materials facility 
compared with sales increased in a decline in panel sales was more than offset by sales growth of in engineered wood products laminated veneer lumber  wood i joists  and laminated beams and in building materials distribution due to an increase in physical sales volume 
plywood unit sales volumes and selling prices decreased and  respectively  while particleboard unit sales volumes and selling prices decreased and  respectively 
these price declines resulted in part from excess market supply of plywood and decreased demand for particleboard in  compared with plywood sales volumes declined due to the closure of our idaho facilities in oriented strand board unit sales volumes and selling prices increased and  respectively 
average prices for our mix of lumber products  which are mostly ponderosa pine appearance and industrial grades  increased in  while sales volumes decreased 
consistent with the decline in plywood  lumber sales volumes declined due to the closure of our idaho facilities 
segment income increased million as reported  or million before accounting for the closure of our idaho operations  from to the increase  before accounting for the closure  resulted from increased distribution sales discussed above and favorable wood and manufacturing costs 
segment income also included million of incremental business organization costs  including plant commissioning and start up expenses  for our external siding plant 
acquisitions in october  we purchased the assets of a building materials distribution operation in riverside  california  for million 
this acquisition marked our entrance into the southern california market area in this business but was not material to our financial position or results of operations 
restructuring activities in february  we announced the permanent closure of our plywood and lumber operations in emmett  idaho  and our sawmill in cascade  idaho  due to the significant decline in federal timber offered for sale 
we completed these closures in second quarter  and positions were eliminated 
in first quarter  we recorded a pretax charge of million related to these closures 
for the year ended december   sales for our idaho operations were million  and our operating loss was million 
in addition  in first quarter  we wrote off our investment in assets in chile with a pretax charge of million 
we recorded both of these charges in our boise building solutions segment and in other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of loss for the year ended december  we recorded asset write downs for plant and equipment at the closed idaho facilities and the write off of our equity investment in and related receivables from a joint venture in chile 
employee related costs included pension curtailment costs arising from the shutdowns of the idaho facilities and severance costs 
we recorded other exit costs  including tear down and environmental cleanup costs related to the idaho facilities and reserves for contractual obligations with no future benefit 
these restructuring reserve liabilities were included in accrued liabilities  other in the consolidated balance sheets 
in  we reclassified million of reserves established for environmental cleanup costs at the idaho facilities to other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining environmental cleanup is expected to take seven years  after which postclosing monitoring will be ongoing 
restructuring reserve liability account activity related to these charges is as follows asset write downs employee related costs other exit costs total millions expense recorded assets written down pension liabilities recorded charges against reserve restructuring reserve at december

sales volume decreased despite a increase in the volume of boise office paper sold through boise office solutions 
weak demand throughout the year led to market related curtailment of nearly  tons  up from the amount taken in most of the curtailment was taken in uncoated free sheet 
relative to a year earlier  average prices rose only 
higher average newsprint prices were partially offset by lower containerboard prices 
in  we increased production of value added papers on our smaller machines 
the tonnage of value added grades from these machines increased to about  tons 
among our value added grades  the volume of label  release  and specialty papers grew in versus the year earlier 
value added grades generally have higher unit costs than commodities but also have higher net sales prices and profit margins 
overall  the average net selling price of the value added grades we sold in was per ton higher than the average net selling price of our uncoated commodity grades 
segment results were lower than those of a year ago because of lower unit sales volumes  more market related curtailment  and increased unit manufacturing costs 
total unit manufacturing costs increased  compared with a year ago 
in  fiber costs rose  and chemical unit costs increased 
fixed unit costs were also up about 
compared with sales declined in  as average paper prices declined per ton  or  compared with uncoated free sheet prices declined  containerboard prices declined  and newsprint prices declined 
low demand in a recessionary economy contributed to these price declines 
despite decreased demand  boise paper solutions unit sales volume increased 
the increase was primarily the result of strong integration of our paper and office products businesses 
in  we sold  tons of our paper through boise office solutions  an increase of from to in  about of our total uncoated free sheet paper  including about of our office papers  was sold through our office products business 
we also increased sales of value added papers produced on our smaller machines 
they were up in to about  tons 
value added grades produced on our smaller paper machines accounted for of our uncoated free sheet sales volume in overall  the average net selling price of the value added grades we sold in was per ton higher than the average net selling price of our uncoated commodity grades 
segment income decreased  compared with  due to lower paper prices  which were partially offset by increased unit sales volume and lower unit manufacturing costs 
unit manufacturing costs decreased in the largest cost improvements resulted from falling energy  fiber  and chemical costs 
during  we took approximately  tons of market related curtailment and approximately  tons of downtime for capital projects and maintenance  compared with approximately  tons and  tons  respectively  in  mostly in uncoated free sheet 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily by using cash generated by our operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  and issuing new debt or equity securities 
given the scale of the officemax acquisition  we have undertaken a review of the direction of the company as a whole by exploring strategic alternatives for our paper and building products businesses 
we will consider alternatives ranging from no change in our business mix to potential restructurings  divestitures  spinoffs  and or other business combinations 
we expect this process  which began late in  to take to months 
as a result of the acquisition of officemax  standard and poor s rating services and moody s investors services  inc lowered our credit ratings to bb and ba  respectively  which are both below investment grade 
these downgrades could affect our cost of and ability to obtain new financing 
we have been successful  however  in accessing the credit markets to finance the officemax acquisition and for other general corporate purposes 
recent financings include million of senior notes due in  million of senior notes due in  and a million unsecured credit agreement 
at december   we had unused borrowing capacity of million under our million revolving credit agreement  which expires in june these financings are described in more detail in the financing activities section that follows 
we intend to reduce our debt levels over time by applying any net cash flow from operations after capital spending and by applying proceeds from the sale of assets  if any 
short term borrowings and the current portion of our long term debt totaled million at december  in december  we will receive million under the terms of our adjustable conversion rate equity security units in exchange for the issuance of between million and million shares of our common stock 
in  scheduled long term debt payments total million 
of this amount  million represents the amount outstanding at december   under our revolving credit agreement 
we expect to enter into a new revolving credit agreement before the expiration of our current agreement 
scheduled long term debt payments total million in  including the million of debt associated with the adjustable conversion rate equity security units 
we make both required and voluntary contributions to our noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
in  we contributed million 
we expect to contribute approximately million to million in both and we expect to limit our capital spending to between million to million  excluding acquisitions  in this level of capital spending will provide for leasehold improvements  new stores  quality and efficiency projects  replacement projects  and ongoing environmental compliance 
our ongoing cash requirements are expected to be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  and possible sales of assets 
the sections that follow discuss in more detail our liquidity and capital resources 
operating activities our operating activities generated million  million  and million of positive cash flow in   and  respectively 
in  items included in net income provided million of cash  and unfavorable changes in working capital items used million of cash from operations 
in  items included in net income provided million of cash  and unfavorable changes in working capital items used million of cash from operations 
net income items provided million of cash in  and favorable changes in working capital items provided million of cash from operations 
we have sold fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of trade accounts receivable 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in the consolidated balance sheet  compared with million excluded at december  and the increase at december   in sold accounts receivable of million over the amount at december   provided cash from operations in some of our us employees are covered by noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the assets of the pension plans are invested primarily in common stocks  fixed income securities  and cash equivalents 
the market performance of these investments affects our recorded pension obligations  expense  and cash contributions 
pension expense in was about million  compared with million in and million in these are noncash charges in our consolidated financial statements 
plan contributions include required minimums and  in some years  additional discretionary amounts 
in  the required minimum contribution was million 
during  we made cash contributions to our pension plans totaling million  compared with million in and million in congress is currently considering temporary pension funding relief to replace the temporary three year pension funding relief legislation that expired on december  under the expired legislation  companies were permitted to use of the average year treasury bond formula as opposed to the previous ceiling 
the house of representatives passed a bill that would allow companies to use a funding discount rate based on an index of high quality corporate bonds to be developed by the treasury department 
the senate has passed similar legislation 
if the legislative efforts result in a discount rate that is similar to the previous temporary relief package  our required minimum contribution to our pension plans in is estimated to be million 
however  if no legislative relief is passed and companies have to return to the ceiling  our minimum contribution in would be approximately million 
we expect to make contributions to the plans of at least the minimums required or  if legislative relief is passed  approximately million to million during we expect to make similar contributions in  assuming some form of comparable pension relief legislation passes 
without pension relief legislation  and depending on interest rates  asset returns  and other factors  our minimum pension contribution in could be higher than that range 
we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to meet our future pension requirements 
for more information  see critical accounting estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was in  compared with in investment activities our cash investing activities used million in  million in  and million in  with cash outlays principally for assets acquired in business combinations discussed below and other capital expenditures 
in all three years  these other capital expenditures primarily reflected the cost of facility improvements  facility and equipment modernization  energy and cost saving projects  and environmental compliance 
in  cash investing activities included million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of officemax  inc  a retail distributor of office supplies and paper  technology products  and office furniture 
for information related to the acquisition  see the discussion under acquisition of officemax in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in  investing activities included million for the acquisition of assets of a wholesale building products distribution and reload operation in riverside  california  and million in cash for the acquisition of assets of a contract furniture company located in southern california 
in  we began construction of a new facility near elma  washington  to manufacture integrated wood polymer building materials 
the plant has had a very difficult start up  in part due to the plant s unique manufacturing processes 
while product quality has met our expectations  production has not reached anticipated levels 
we recently announced that we would temporarily discontinue production at the facility to allow us to make the technical improvements necessary to increase production levels 
we are not able to predict how long these improvements may take or at what time shipments of product will resume 
the total cost of this facility was approximately million 
we spent million in  million in  and million in in  investing activities also included about million to build a veneer and plywood manufacturing facility in brazil and million of cash for one office products acquisition 
our expenditures for timber and timberlands included million for the acquisition of approximately  acres of timberland in alabama and brazil 
in  we received the second payment from the sale of our european office products operation in september we used this million payment to reduce debt 
noncash consideration included in capital spending consisted of the assumption of debt and recording of liabilities totaling million in  million in  and million in it also included million for the issuance of million of boise common shares to officemax shareholders electing stock 
details of capital investment by segment are included in the table below capital investment by segment acquisitions expansion quality efficiency a timber and timberlands replacement  environmental  and other total millions boise office solutions  contract boise office solutions  retail   boise building solutions boise paper solutions corporate and other a quality and efficiency projects include quality improvements  modernization  energy  and cost saving projects 
we expect our capital investments in to total between million and million  excluding acquisitions 
our capital spending in will be for leasehold improvements  new stores  quality and efficiency projects  replacement projects  and ongoing environmental compliance 
during  we spent million on environmental compliance 
we expect to spend approximately million in for this purpose 
see the section titled environmental in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financing activities our financing activities provided million in and used million in and million in common and preferred dividend payments totaled million in  million in  and million in in all three years  our quarterly cash dividend was cents per common share 
additions to long term debt in resulted primarily from our acquisition of officemax 
additions included million under an unsecured credit agreement  million of notes  million of notes  million of medium term notes  and million for the sale leaseback of equipment at our integrated wood polymer building materials facility near elma  washington  that was accounted for as a financing arrangement 
payments of long term debt in included million of medium term notes and million under our revolving credit agreement 
additions to long term debt in included million of notes due in  a million floating rate term loan  and million in medium term notes 
payments of long term debt in included million of notes  million of industrial revenue bonds  million of bank debt for our australian operations  and million of medium term notes 
in  our debt increased million to billion 
our debt to equity ratio was 
at december   and at december  our debt to equity ratio decreased because the increase in equity from the stock issued for the officemax acquisition was greater than the increase in debt that resulted from the officemax acquisition 
we lease our store space and other property and equipment under operating leases 
these operating leases are not included in debt  however  they represent a significant commitment 
obligations under operating leases are shown in the contractual obligations section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our debt structure consists of credit agreements  note agreements  adjustable conversion rate equity security units  and other borrowings 
see note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k for a listing of our debt 
for more information  also see contractual obligations and disclosures of financial market risks in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent changes to our debt structure are as follows credit agreements in march  we entered into a three year  unsecured revolving credit agreement with major financial institutions 
the agreement permits us to borrow as much as million at variable interest rates based on either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the borrowing capacity under the agreement can be expanded to a maximum of million 
borrowings under the agreement were million at december  in addition to these borrowings  million of letters of credit are considered a draw on the revolver  thus reducing our borrowing capacity as of december   to million 
at december   our borrowing rate under the revolving credit agreement was 
we have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk from the variable interest payments on million of libor based debt  which gave us an effective interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement of at december  the revolving credit agreement contains customary conditions to borrowing  including compliance with financial covenants relating to minimum net worth  minimum interest coverage ratio  and ceiling ratio of debt to capitalization 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
under this agreement  the payment of dividends depends on the existence and amount of net worth in excess of the defined minimum 
our net worth at december   exceeded the defined minimum by  million 
when the agreement expires in june  any amount outstanding will be due and payable 
in december  we entered into a month  unsecured credit agreement with major financial institutions 
under the agreement  we borrowed million at variable interest rates based on either the libor or the prime rate 
at december   our borrowing rate under the agreement was 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that are essentially the same as those in our revolving credit agreement discussed above  except that the terms require that the net proceeds of asset sales in excess of the first million be used to reduce the loan balance 
the agreement also states that a lien will be applied to no less than million of our inventory if our credit ratings fall to either bb or ba or lower 
when the agreement expires in june  any amount outstanding will be due and payable 
note agreements in august  we issued million of medium term notes due in the proceeds of the notes were used for general corporate purposes 
in october  we issued million of senior notes due in and million of senior notes due in we may redeem all or part of the senior notes at any time at redemption prices defined in the indenture 
net proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  to provide cash for the officemax transaction see the acquisition of officemax section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and for other general corporate purposes 
we paid approximately million in fees and expenses associated with the senior notes transaction 
the fees are being amortized over the terms of the senior notes 
the senior notes are unsecured  however  the senior notes indenture contains covenants and restrictions that could restrict our ability to borrow money  issue preferred stock  pay dividends  repurchase stock  incur subsidiary debt  make investments in persons or firms other than our majority owned subsidiaries  or expand into unrelated businesses 
in particular  the indenture allows us to incur debt or issue preferred stock only if we meet a fixed charges coverage ratio of to over the preceding four calendar quarters 
the indenture does permit us to borrow up to million  pay up to million of common dividends per quarter  and pay for the dividends and repurchases of our series d preferred stock 
at the present time and given our financial condition  we do not believe these covenants and restrictions limit our ability to operate our business in the normal course 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
if we undergo a change of control  the note holders can require us to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to of the notes principal amount 
similarly  if we sell assets under conditions specified in the indenture  the note holders can require us to use proceeds to repurchase the senior notes at of the principal amount 
if we spin off one or more of our business units  the newly created company may offer to exchange the notes for substantially similar notes of the new company 
if this occurs  we must make a concurrent offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount 
as a result of the acquisition of officemax  standard and poor s rating services and moody s investors services  inc  lowered our credit ratings to bb and ba  respectively  which are both below investment grade 
if we regain investment grade ratings with both credit rating agencies  the senior note covenants discussed above will be automatically replaced with the covenants found in our other public debt  except that a restriction on subsidiary indebtedness will remain 
adjustable conversion rate equity security units in december  boise cascade trust i issued  adjustable conversion rate equity security units to the public at an aggregate offering price of million 
boise cascade trust i is a statutory business trust wholly owned by the company 
there are two components of each unit 
investors received a preferred security issued by the trust with a liquidation amount of  which is mandatorily redeemable in december the trust will terminate upon the redemption of the preferred securities 
from each unit  investors receive a quarterly distribution at the annual rate of 
the rate will be repriced in september based on then market rates of return 
investors also have a contract to purchase worth of common shares of boise in december  subject to a collar arrangement 
for each unit  investors will receive between and of our common shares  depending on the average trading price of our common stock at that time 
we will receive per unit or million 
the units trade on the new york stock exchange under ticker symbol bep 
the trust used the proceeds from the offering to purchase debentures issued by boise 
these debentures are senior  unsecured obligations that mature in december they carry the same payment terms as the preferred securities issued by the trust 
we irrevocably guarantee the trust s distributions on the preferred securities 
our guarantee is senior and unsecured and is limited to the funds the trust receives from the debentures 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
interpretation no 
 as revised  required us to reclassify million of adjustable conversion rate equity security units from minority interest to debt in our consolidated balance sheets and recognize distributions on these securities as interest expense rather than minority interest  net of income tax in our consolidated statements of income loss 
as allowed by the fasb s revised interpretation no 
 prior years financial statements were reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 
in all periods presented  there was no net effect on earnings  and the reclassification of these securities to debt did not affect our financial covenants 
other in march  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
this swap converts million of fixed rate million debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately 
the effective interest rates at december  and  were and 
this swap expires in may changes in short term borrowings represent net changes in notes payable 
at december  and  we had million and million of short term borrowings outstanding 
the minimum and maximum amounts of combined short term borrowings outstanding were and million during the year ended december   and were and million during the year ended december  the average amounts of short term borrowings outstanding during the years ended december  and  were million and million 
for and  the average interest rates for these borrowings were and 
at december   we had million of unused borrowing capacity registered with the securities and exchange commission sec for additional debt securities 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations as of december  some of the figures we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the enforceable and legally binding obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table

these borrowings are further explained in note  debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
the table assumes our long term debt is held to maturity 
b we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
we lease our retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
some of our retail store leases require percentage rentals on sales above specified minimums and contain escalation clauses 
these minimum lease payments do not include contingent rental expense 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note  leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
c included in raw materials is million for contracts to purchase timber 
we acquire a portion of our wood requirements from outside sources 
except for deposits required pursuant to wood supply contracts  these obligations are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements until contract payment terms take effect 
the obligations are subject to change based on  among other things  the effect of governmental laws and regulations  our manufacturing operations not operating in the normal course of business  timber availability  and the status of environmental appeals 
d we enter into utility contracts for the purchase of electricity and natural gas 
we also purchase these services under utility tariffs 
the contractual and tariff arrangements include multiple year commitments and minimum annual purchase requirements 
our payment obligations were valued at prices in effect on december   or contract language  if available 
these obligations represent the face value of the contracts and do not consider resale value 
generally  our utility contracts for the purchase of electricity do not permit resale 
however  several of our commitments to purchase natural gas do permit resale 
e the current portion of these liabilities is also included 
f compensation and benefits includes amounts associated with our retirement and benefit plans and other compensation arrangements 
for more information  see critical accounting estimates pensions and see note  retirement and benefit plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k 
g lease obligations for facility closures are included in operating leases 
in accordance with an amended and restated joint venture agreement  the minority owner of our subsidiary in mexico  officemax de mexico  can elect to put its remaining interest in the subsidiary to boise if earnings targets are achieved 
at december   officemax de mexico had met these earnings targets 
these earnings targets are calculated quarterly on a rolling four quarter basis 
accordingly  the targets can be achieved in one quarter but not in the next 
when the earnings targets are achieved and the minority owner elects to put its ownership interest  the purchase price would be equal to fair value  calculated based on both the subsidiary s earnings for the last four quarters before interest  taxes  and depreciation and amortization and the current market multiples of similar companies 
the fair value purchase price in is estimated at million to million 
this contingent obligation is not included in the table above 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business 
these contracts  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
off balance sheet activities and guarantees we have sold fractional ownership interests in a defined pool of accounts receivable 
we account for this sales program under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we have entered into this program to provide us funding at rates favorable to our other borrowing arrangements 
under this program  we sell substantially all of our domestic trade accounts receivable on a revolving basis to a fully consolidated  wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary in turn sells a fractional ownership interest in the receivables to affiliates of two banks 
based on the terms of the sale  we record the sales as true sales and not as loans secured by the receivables 
at december   million of sold accounts receivable were excluded from receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
the portion of fractional ownership interest we retain is included in receivables in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of our retained interest is subordinate to the interests of the bank affiliates  providing them credit support if the receivables become uncollectible 
the anticipated impact of the credit support is reflected in our allowance for uncollectible receivables 
the proceeds available under this program could be reduced  based on the level of eligible receivables  restrictions on the concentrations of receivables  and the historical performance of the receivables 
the available proceeds may not exceed million under our current agreements 
our costs under this program vary based on changes in interest rates 
they totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the purchasers of the receivables commit to our securitization program in day increments 
when the current program expires  none of the parties are obligated to renew the arrangement 
our experience over the last five years  however  has been that the parties do renew the arrangement with minimal alterations 
if the program were not renewed  we would obtain replacement funding from alternative funding sources 
use of those sources  however  might result in an increase in our interest expense and an increase in both liabilities and assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
guarantees note  commitments and guarantees  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data in this form k describes the nature of our guarantees  including the approximate terms of the guarantees  how the guarantees arose  the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees  and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make 
inflationary and seasonal influences we believe inflation has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be affected by inflation in the future 
our office products businesses are seasonal 
sales in the second quarter and summer months are historically the slowest of the year 
our building products businesses are dependent on housing starts  repair and remodel activity  and commercial and industrial building  which in turn are influenced by the availability and cost of mortgage funds 
declines in building activity that may occur during winter affect our building products businesses 
in addition  cold weather may affect our operating costs including energy at our manufacturing facilities 
disclosures of financial market risks our debt is predominantly fixed rate 
at december   the estimated current market value of our debt  based on then current interest rates for similar obligations with like maturities  was approximately million more than the amount of debt reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values of our other financial instruments  cash and cash equivalents  receivables  and short term borrowings are the same as their carrying values 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any significant concentration of credit risks 
concentration of credit risks with respect to trade receivables is limited due to the wide variety of customers and channels to and through which our products are sold  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas 
changes in interest and currency rates expose the company to financial market risk 
we occasionally use derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  rate hedge agreements  forward purchase contracts  and forward exchange contracts  to hedge underlying debt obligations or anticipated transactions 
we do not use them for trading purposes 
for qualifying hedges  the interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swap or underlying debt 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency firm commitments and anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and recognized in income as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transactions occur 
unrealized gains and losses on all other forward exchange contracts are included in current period net income loss 
in november  we entered into a natural gas swap to hedge the variable cash flow risk on  mmbtu per day of natural gas usage to a fixed price 
the swap expires in march the swap was designated as a cash flow hedge 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swap  net of taxes  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet 
the swap was fully effective in hedging the changes in the index price of the hedged item 
effective january  we entered into two electricity swaps that convert and megawatts of usage per hour to a fixed price 
these swaps expire december  these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges 
beginning in  the changes in the fair value of the swaps  net of taxes  were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million 
this swap converts million of fixed rate million debentures to variable rate debt based on six month libor plus approximately 
the effective interest rates at december  and  were and 
the swap expires in may this swap is designated as a fair value hedge of a proportionate amount of the fixed rate debentures 
the swap and debentures are marked to market  with changes in the fair value of the instruments recorded in income loss 
this swap was fully effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the hedged item  accordingly  changes in the fair value of this instrument had no net effect on our reported income loss 
in january  we entered into electricity and natural gas swaps that converted megawatts and  mmbtu of usage to a fixed rate 
the electricity swap expired at the end of  and the natural gas swaps expired in march in august  we entered into an electricity swap that converted megawatts of usage in the northwest to a fixed rate 
this swap expired at the end of all of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of the swaps  net of taxes  were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
these swaps were fully effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
in february  we entered into two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each  one that matured in february and one that matured in february in november  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million that will mature in november the swaps hedged the variable cash flow risk from the variable interest payments on million and million of our libor based debt in and the effective interest rates from the swaps in and were and 
changes in the fair value of these swaps  net of taxes  were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense as interest expense was recognized on the libor based debt 
amounts reclassified in   and increased interest expense by million  million  and million  respectively 
assuming no change in interest rates  million would be reclassified in ineffectiveness related to these hedges was not significant 
we are exposed to modest credit related risks in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
however  we do not expect the counterparties  which are all major financial institutions  to fail to meet their obligations 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates or utility indexes 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for obligations with variable interest rates and sensitivity to energy market risk  the table sets forth payout amounts based on current rates and does not attempt to project future rates

the primary sources of wood fiber are timber and the byproducts of timber  such as wood chips  wood shavings  and sawdust 
factors such as governmental forest management practices and regulations and urban real estate development influence the supply of timber 
we own or control approximately million acres of timberland in the united states 
we manage our timberlands as part of our boise building solutions and boise paper solutions segments 
the financial impact of our timberlands on our results of operations is included in these segments 
the open market cost of timber and other wood fiber is subject to commodity pricing  which can fluctuate greatly depending on weather  governmental restraints  and industry conditions 
the amount of timber we harvest each year from our timber resources  compared with the amount we purchase from outside sources  varies according to the price and supply of wood fiber for sale on the open market and the harvest levels we deem sound in the management of our timberlands 
during  we met of our fiber needs through our own timber and wood fiber sources  through private sources  and through government sources 
during  these percentages were   and  and in  they were   and 
in march  we announced that we would no longer harvest timber from old growth forests in the united states 
this policy became effective in as a result of this policy  we will not enter into any timber sale contracts on public or private forestlands that require harvesting old growth forests 
this policy formally recognizes a trend that we had already been following for several years 
our formal adoption of this policy will not materially affect our available timber supply 
changes in government policy and environmental litigation can cause the amount of timber available for commercial harvest from public and private lands to vary considerably 
declines in the amount of timber offered for sale can negatively impact our wood manufacturing facilities 
in recent years  these declines have been severe enough to cause the closure of numerous facilities  including two of our own 
future legislation and litigation concerning the use of public lands  the protection of endangered species  the promotion of forest health  and the response to and prevention of catastrophic wildfires may either increase or decrease the amount of timber supply from both public and private forestlands 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future log supply and costs or its potential impact on our manufacturing facilities 
long term leases of private timberlands generally provide boise with timber harvesting rights and carry with them responsibility for managing the timberlands 
the remaining life of all leases  including renewal terms  ranges from to years 
in addition  we have an option to purchase approximately  acres of timberland under lease and or contract in the southern united states 
we manage our timberlands so that they will provide a continuous and sustainable supply of wood for future needs 
our two northwest pulp and paper mills receive approximately of their wood chips from internal sources  including our whole log chipping facility  our cottonwood fiber farm near wallula  washington  and our northwest building materials manufacturing facilities 
excluding the chips provided by our yakima plywood and lumber operations  which were sold in february  about would have been provided from internal sources 
roughly of the pulp used by our uncoated free sheet machine in wallula during was made from cottonwood fiber from our farm 
in  we sold approximately  acres of timberland in idaho and  acres in alabama 
in  we purchased approximately  acres of timberland to support the operations of our plywood and lumber mills in northeastern oregon and also sold approximately  acres in alabama 
in  we purchased approximately  acres of timberland to support the operations of our pulp and paper mill in jackson  alabama 
fiber for our veneer and plywood plant in brazil is initially coming from private sources 
boise manages the land and trees and schedules the harvest for one of these private sources in brazil under multiyear agreements 
this private source provides a significant portion of our plant s fiber needs 
in  we also purchased approximately  acres of eucalyptus plantation land in brazil to meet the future fiber requirements of the plant 
boise s success depends on responsible environmental stewardship our ability to sustain the resources that contribute to the products and services we offer our customers 
our forest management practices embrace our own forest stewardship values and measures as well as the sustainable forestry initiative sfi program  a comprehensive system of principles  objectives  and performance measures that integrates the sustainable growing and harvesting of trees with protection of wildlife  plants  soil  and water quality 
during and  pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc conducted sustainable forestry audits on our us timberlands  and on other private and public lands from which we purchase timber  to determine whether our forest management practices complied with the sfi program requirements 
those pwc audits found our timberlands to be in full compliance with sfi requirements  resulting in our timberlands being certified under the sfi standard 
during  the sfi program added a product labeling component for manufactured products 
this component calls for independent  third party audits of fiber sources and fiber procurement processes 
products manufactured at a certified facility can bear the sfi label 
audits of our fiber sources and fiber procurement processes are being performed as part of a second round of sustainable forest audits that began in and will be completed in pwc is performing these audits  and we will publish findings from them in late environmental our businesses are subject to a wide range of general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations 
boise paper solutions and boise building solutions  in particular  are affected by laws and regulations covering air emissions  wastewater discharges  solid and hazardous waste management  site remediation  and forestry operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in the operation of these businesses 
we incur substantial capital and operating expenditures to comply with federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or in enforcement actions 
our failure to comply could also result in governmental or judicial orders that stop or interrupt our operations or require us to take corrective measures  install additional pollution control equipment  or take other remedial actions 
we anticipate capital expenditures of about million in to comply with environmental requirements 
we anticipate spending similar or greater amounts in the years ahead 
these capital expenditures  along with our established operating procedures and controls  will allow us to continue to meet environmental standards 
in january  the environmental protection agency epa proposed rules that regulate air emissions from boilers and wood panel plants 
we expect the epa to finalize these rules in while the final requirements are not yet known  we expect capital expenditures in the range of million to million to comply with these rules during the period from to as an owner and operator of real estate  we may be liable under environmental laws for the cleanup of past and present spills and releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from our properties and operations 
we can be found liable under these laws if we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such substances 
in some cases  this liability may exceed the value of the property itself 
we have been notified that we are a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or similar federal and state laws  or have received a claim from a private party  with respect to active sites where hazardous substances or other contaminants are or may be located 
in most cases  we are one of many potentially responsible parties  and our alleged contribution to these sites is relatively minor 
for sites where a range of potential liability can be determined  we have established appropriate reserves 
we believe we have minimal or no responsibility with regard to several other sites 
we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of the total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups 
based on our investigations  our experience with respect to cleanup of hazardous substances  the fact that expenditures will  in many cases  be incurred over extended periods of time  and the number of solvent potentially responsible parties  we do not believe that the known actual and potential response costs will  in the aggregate  materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results 
these estimates require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain 
we reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our current critical accounting estimates are as follows pensions we have experienced rapidly increasing retirement benefit plan costs 
in response to escalating costs  the retirement committee approved the following changes to our pension plan for salaried employees no new entrants into the plan effective november   a reduction in the service crediting rate for years of service earned after december   from to  and for boise office solutions  contract  participants  a benefit freeze effective december   with one additional year of service provided to active boise office solutions  contract  participants on january   at the crediting rate 
the benefit freeze at our boise office solutions  contract  segment affects about  of our  employees 
these changes had a small negative effect on our expense and will have a million favorable impact on expense in  with a positive compounding effect over time 
we account for pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
this statement requires us to calculate our pension expense and liabilities using actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate assumption and a long term asset return assumption 
we base our discount rate assumption on the rates of return on high quality bonds currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
we base our long term asset return assumption on the average rate of earnings expected on invested funds 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to pensions is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  based on the performance of plan assets  actuarial valuations  and changes in interest rates  and the effect on our financial position and results of operations could be material 
the estimate for pensions is a critical accounting estimate for our boise office solutions  contract  boise building solutions  boise paper solutions  and corporate and other segments 
the boise office solutions  retail  employees  among others  do not participate in the pension plans 
for  our discount rate assumption was  and our long term asset return assumption was 
using these assumptions  our pension expense was million  following expense of million and million in and if we had decreased our estimated discount rate to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would have been million  and net income would have decreased approximately million 
if we had increased our discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would have been million  and net income would have increased approximately million 
for  our discount rate assumption is  and our expected return on plan assets is 
using these assumptions  we estimate that our pension expense will be approximately million 
if we were to decrease our estimated discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
if we were to increase our discount rate assumption to and our expected return on plan assets to  our pension expense would be approximately million 
pension plan contributions include required minimums and  in some years  additional discretionary amounts 
in  the required minimum contribution was million 
during  we made cash contributions to our pension plans totaling million  compared with million in and million in congress is currently considering temporary pension funding relief to replace the temporary three year pension funding relief legislation that expired on december  under the expired legislation  companies were permitted to use of the average year treasury bond formula as opposed to the previous ceiling 
the house of representatives passed a bill that would allow companies to use a funding discount rate based on an index of high quality corporate bonds to be developed by the treasury department 
the senate has passed similar legislation 
if the legislative efforts result in a discount rate that is similar to the previous temporary relief package  our required minimum contribution to our pension plans in is estimated to be million 
however  if no legislative relief is passed and companies have to return to the ceiling  our minimum contribution in would be approximately million 
we expect to make contributions to the plans of at least the minimums required or  if legislative relief is passed  approximately million to million during we expect to make similar contributions in  assuming some form of comparable pension relief legislation passes 
without pension relief legislation  and depending on interest rates  asset returns  and other factors  our minimum pension contribution in could be higher than that range 
we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to meet our future pension requirements 
the amount of additional minimum pension liability is determined based on the value of plan assets compared with the plans accumulated benefit obligation 
because of better returns on plan assets in than  our minimum pension liability decreased  resulting in a million increase in shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   our discount rate assumption was 
if we had changed our estimated discount rate to  our minimum pension liability adjustment would have increased shareholders equity million 
if we had changed our discount rate assumption to  our minimum pension liability adjustment would have increased shareholders equity million 
the change in the additional minimum liability that we will record in will depend on the actual market value of plan assets on our valuation date december and the assumptions chosen at that date 
when recorded  the adjustments to the minimum pension liability are noncash and do not affect net income loss 
long lived asset impairment we account for the impairment of long lived assets in all of our segments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment of a long lived asset exists when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value and when the carrying value is not recoverable through future operations 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
long lived asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate  as it is susceptible to change from period to period 
to estimate whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is impaired  we estimate the cash flows that could be generated under a range of possible outcomes  and we estimate the likelihood of possible outcomes 
to measure future cash flows  we are required to make assumptions about future production volumes  future product pricing  and future expenses to be incurred 
in addition  estimates of future cash flows may change based on the availability of timber  environmental requirements  capital spending  and other strategic management decisions 
we estimate the fair value of an asset or asset group based on quoted market prices the amount for which the asset s could be bought or sold in a current transaction with a third party  when available 
when quoted market prices are not available  we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value 
as discussed above  in december  we completed our acquisition of officemax 
given the scale of the officemax acquisition  we have undertaken a review of the direction of the company as a whole by exploring strategic alternatives for our paper and building products businesses 
we are considering alternatives ranging from no change in our business mix to potential restructurings  divestitures  spinoffs  and or other business combinations 
we expect this process  which began late in  to take to months 
the review of the company s strategic direction could affect our valuations of expected future cash flows 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of assets and the effects of changes in circumstances timber availability  environmental requirements  capital spending  and other management decisions on these valuations  both the precision and reliability of our estimates are subject to uncertainty 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
environmental remediation we are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws and regulations 
as is the case with other companies in similar industries  we face exposure from actual or potential claims and legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
we account for environmental remediation liabilities in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position we record liabilities on an undiscounted basis when assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate our environmental liabilities based on various assumptions and judgments  as we cannot predict with certainty the total response and remedial costs  our share of total costs  the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties  or the amount of time necessary to complete any remediation 
in making these judgments and assumptions  we consider  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites  information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors  and our historical experience at other sites that are judged to be comparable 
due to the number of uncertainties and variables associated with these assumptions and judgments and the effects of changes in governmental regulation and environmental technologies  the precision of the resulting estimates of the related liabilities is subject to uncertainty 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to our environmental liabilities 
as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change 
goodwill impairment we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  typically resulting in goodwill 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
the statement requires estimates of the fair value of our reporting units 
if we determine the fair values are less than the carrying amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  we must recognize an impairment in our financial statements 
at december   we had billion of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
of the billion  million  million  and million were recorded in our boise office solutions  contract  boise office solutions  retail  and boise building solutions segments  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our boise office solutions  contract  and boise building solutions segments in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we concluded that no impairment existed 
based on our review for impairment indicators in the last three quarters of  we have determined that an impairment review is not required prior to our annual review during the first quarter of in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units based upon discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting our estimated average cost of funds 
differences in assumptions used in projecting future operating cash flows and cost of funds could have a significant impact on the determination of impairment amounts 
in estimating future cash flows for our office products and building products businesses  we used our internal budgets 
our budgets were based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches or capital projects  and customer commitments related to new and existing products 
these budgets also included assumptions of future production volumes and pricing of commodity products 
due to the inherent volatility of commodity product pricing  our pricing assumptions were based on the average pricing over the commodity cycle 
these prices were estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts  and other published forecasts 
if our estimates of projected future cash flows were too high by  there would be no impact on the reported value of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances on these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
cautionary and forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
statements that are not historical or current facts  including statements about our expectations  anticipated financial results  and future business prospects  are forward looking statements

you can find examples of these statements throughout this report  including the summary and outlook section 
we cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward looking statements we make in this report 
we have listed below inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those we project 
we do not assume an obligation to update any forward looking statement 
competition in our markets could harm our ability to achieve or maintain profitability 
all of the markets we serve are highly competitive  with a number of large companies operating in each 
we compete in our markets principally through price  service  quality  and value added products and services 
boise office solutions  contract and retail 
the office products market is highly competitive 
purchasers of office products have many options when purchasing office supplies and paper  technology products  and office furniture 
we compete with worldwide contract stationers  large retail office products suppliers  direct mail distributors  discount retailers  drugstores  supermarkets  and thousands of local and regional contract stationers  many of whom have long standing customer relationships 
increased competition in the office products industry  together with increased advertising  has heightened price awareness among end users 
such heightened price awareness has led to margin pressure on office products 
besides price  competition is also based on customer service 
boise building solutions 
the building products markets in which we compete are very large and highly fragmented  with fewer than ten national producers but hundreds of local and regional manufacturers and distributors 
most of our competitors are located in the united states and canada  although we have seen increasing competition from outside north america 
we compete not only with manufacturers and distributors of similar building products but also with products made from alternative materials  such as steel and plastic 
many factors chiefly price  quality  and service influence competition in the building products markets 
boise paper solutions 
our major paper products are uncoated free sheet  containerboard  and newsprint  all of which are globally traded commodities with numerous worldwide manufacturers and distributors 
about a dozen major manufacturers compete in the north american paper market 
price  quality  and service are important competitive determinants across paper markets 
all of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the united states  and we compete largely in the domestic arena 
we do  however  face competition from foreign producers 
the level of this competition varies depending on the level of demand abroad and the relative rates of currency exchange 
our paper products also compete with electronic transmission and document storage alternatives 
as trends toward more use of these alternatives continue  we may see variances in the overall demand for paper products or shifts from one type of paper to another 
for example  demand for newsprint has declined as newspapers are replaced with electronic media 
some of our competitors in each of our businesses are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources available to them  and there can be no assurance that we can continue to compete successfully with them 
some of our competitors are also currently lower cost producers than we are and may be better able to withstand price declines 
in addition  if we do not continue to provide excellent customer service and quality products in each of our businesses  our profitability in each business and our overall profitability may be harmed 
we cannot ensure that our integration with officemax will be successful 
integrating and coordinating our operations and personnel with those of officemax will involve complex operational and personnel related challenges 
this process will be time consuming and expensive  may disrupt the business of either or both companies  and may not result in the full benefits we expect 
the difficulties  costs  and delays that could be encountered include unanticipated issues in integrating information  communications  and other systems  negative effects on employee morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments  difficulties attracting and retaining key personnel  loss of customers  unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing  logistics  marketing  paper sales  and administration methods  and unanticipated costs of terminating or relocating facilities and operations 
we have more indebtedness since the merger  which could adversely affect our cash flows  business  and ability to fulfill our debt obligations 
we have a substantial amount of debt  some of which we recently incurred as part of our acquisition of officemax 
as of january   our outstanding debt was billion 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other purposes  increase the cost and reduce the availability of funds from commercial lenders  debt financing transactions  and other sources  increase our vulnerability to  and limit our flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  create competitive disadvantages compared with other companies with lower debt levels  and cause further downgrading of our credit rating  which could limit our ability to borrow money and increase the cost of doing so 
the outcome and timing of our evaluation of strategic alternatives is uncertain 
at the same time we announced our acquisition of officemax  we announced we would evaluate strategic alternatives for our paper and building products businesses 
we have engaged goldman  sachs co 
to assist the company in developing  evaluating  and implementing these alternatives 
we are considering alternatives ranging from no change in our business mix to restructurings  divestitures  spinoffs  and other business combinations 
the evaluation and any subsequent implementation of the plans that we develop could  in fact  take longer than we have anticipated 
the evaluation and its timing  outcome  and implementation may significantly affect the company and its future financial results and business prospects 
the prices we charge for our paper and building products are subject to cyclical market pressures 
our paper and building products businesses are subject to cyclical market pressures 
historical prices for our products have been volatile  and our direct influence over the timing and extent of price changes for our products is limited 
the relationship between supply and demand in the paper and building products industries significantly affects product pricing 
demand for building products is driven mainly by factors outside our control  such as the construction  repair and remodeling  and industrial markets  interest rates  and weather 
the supply of paper and building products fluctuates based on available manufacturing capacity  and excess capacity in either industry  both domestically and abroad  can result in significant declines in market prices for our products 
prolonged periods of weak demand or excess supply in any of our businesses could negatively affect our market share  seriously reduce our margins  and harm our liquidity  financial condition  or results of operations 
increases in our raw material costs may harm the results of our operations 
the cost of our raw supplies  such as wood fiber  energy  and chemicals  significantly affects the results of our operations 
selling prices of our products have not always increased in response to increases in the prices of our raw materials 
on occasion  our results of operations have been  and in the future may be  harmed if we are unable to pass raw material price increases through to our customers 
wood fiber is a significant raw material for our paper and building products businesses 
the percentage of our wood fiber requirements obtained from our timberlands will fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including changes in our timber harvest levels and changes in our manufacturing capacity 
the cost of various types of wood fiber that we purchase in the market has at times fluctuated greatly because of economic or industry conditions 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be limited by natural disasters such as fire  insect infestation  disease  ice storms  windstorms  flooding  and other weather conditions and causes 
we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our standing timber from natural disasters or other causes 
environmental regulation and environmental compliance expenditures affect our results 
our paper and building products businesses are subject to a wide range of general and industry specific environmental laws and regulations  particularly with respect to air emissions  wastewater discharges  solid and hazardous waste management  site remediation  forestry operations  and endangered species 
compliance with these laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business 
we expect to continue to incur significant capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  including permit requirements  could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties or in enforcement actions  including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures  installation of pollution control equipment  or remedial actions 
as an owner and operator of real estate  we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup and other costs and damages  including tort liability  resulting from past or present spills or releases of hazardous or toxic substances on or from our properties 
liability under these laws may be imposed without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such substances on our property and  in some cases  may not be limited to the value of the property 
unanticipated situations could give rise to material environmental liabilities 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant expenditures 
we may be unable to generate funds or other sources of liquidity and capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures
