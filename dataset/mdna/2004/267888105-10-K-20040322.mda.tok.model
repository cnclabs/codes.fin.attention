item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the year ended december  proved to be a challenging one for dmc 
our explosive metalworking group and aerospace group both experienced declines in sales and operating results in as compared to those in additionally  our pmp division continued to experience significant operating losses in  leading to our decision to sell this underperforming division 
the sale of pmp was completed on october  and the operating losses of pmp  as well as the loss recorded on the sale  have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and pmp results were previously reported with those of our aerospace group 
as a result of a decrease in income from continuing operations from  in to  in and a loss from discontinued operations of  in  dmc reported a consolidated net loss of  for the year ended december  this consolidated net loss compared to consolidated net income of  in that included a loss from discontinued operations of  and an after tax loss of  from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle that related to the write off of pmp s goodwill 
the explosive metalworking group began with a relatively low backlog of million and experienced a slow flow of new orders during the first half of as a result  explosive metalworking sales and operating income declined to  and  respectively  from  and  respectively  in after eliminating the favorable foreign exchange effects of approximately million relating to the translation of nobelclad europe s sales from euros to us dollars  the year to year sales decline for the explosive metalworking group approximated million 
other than the variable costs of direct materials  supplies  labor and subcontract costs associated with the production and sale of clad products  the major portion of manufacturing overhead expenses and operating expenses for both the us and european cladding businesses are fixed in nature 
as a result  the decrease in sales volume led to a significant reduction in gross profit margins and operating income for the explosive metalworking group 
steps have recently been taken to improve the fixed cost structure of our two european cladding businesses  but full benefit from these organizational changes will not be realized until due to transitional employment and severance costs that will be incurred in the outlook for measurable improvement in sales performance and operating income is promising 
the explosive metalworking backlog increased to million at december  and the flow of new orders during the early weeks of has been very strong 
us demand for our clad metal products is largely driven by plant maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing and oil refining facilities 
postponed capital spending within these industries over the past few years  improved economic conditions and the clean fuels act appear to be working together to increase demand for our products in the us in contrast to the us market  demand for our clad products in europe is more dependent on large projects  such as the building of new purified terephthalic acid pta plants in different parts of the world  and on sales of electrical transition joints that are used in the aluminum smelting industry 
european sales should improve in as nobelclad receives expected customer orders in support of scheduled new pta plant construction and continues to gain market share in the electrical transition joint business 
we do not expect to benefit in from a large nickel hydrometallurgy project  such as the goro project that contributed more than million to sales  but new hydrometallurgy projects are in the planning phase and could appear as early as our aerospace group reported sales of  in as compared to sales of  in this decrease in sales  which was split evenly between spin forge and amk welding  contributed to an increase in the aerospace group operating loss from  in to  in spin forge reported operating losses in excess of million in both and  with its operating loss being almost entirely offset by record operating income at amk welding 
while spin forge is currently involved in a number of new development programs  it remains highly dependent on two missile motor case programs for the defense industry 
there are no current orders for one of these two programs and it is not clear when spin forge will receive the next order 
management is hopeful that spin forge can show the significant improvement in its sales and operating results that has been budgeted  but such improvement is dependent on the booking of a significant amount of new orders during the first half of amk welding reported record sales and operating income in as a result of significant revenues from welding development work on a new ground based turbine that did not recur in amk welding sales and operating results for will likely be comparable to those for  but the prospects for and beyond appear to be excellent as the new ground based turbine goes into production and the demand for commercial aircraft engines  which has been depressed since  improves 
as the new ground based turbine goes into production  amk welding may be required to invest approximately  to  in a new heat treat furnace and other capital equipment to support the anticipated increase in production volume and customer delivery requirements 
the company believes that it will have sufficient cash resources to fund such capital expenditures 
despite the net loss reported in and the small amount of net income reported in  dmc generated cash flow from operations of more than million and million for the respective years 
approximately million and million of the operating cash flow was used for capital expenditures in and  respectively  with most of the remaining operating cash flow used to repay long term debt obligations or reduce net borrowings under working capital lines of credit 
with the expected improvement in operating income and minimal expected income tax payments due to more than million in net operating loss carry forwards for us federal income tax purposes  operating cash flow for should be very strong 
a significant portion of the operating cash flow that we expect to generate in will be used to satisfy approximately million in principle payments that are due in under various long term debt agreements  which will further strengthen our balance sheet that benefited from long term debt principal payments of approximately million in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for decreased to  from  in sales by our explosive metalworking group  which include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  decreased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the explosive metalworking sales decrease reflects a decrease in us clad sales that was partially offset by a us dollar sales increase at nobleclad europe 
the noblelclad europe sales increase of approximately million includes a sales volume decrease of approximately million that was entirely offset by a favorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately million due to the significant decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro 
the decrease in worldwide explosive metalworking group sales is principally attributable to more than million of shipments in support of inco s goro nickel project in new caledonia 
there were no similar large project orders and shipments in our aerospace group contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this sales decrease reflects year to year sales decreases of and at spin forge and amk welding  respectively 
the spin forge sales decrease relates to the absence of sales in under a pressurant tank program for launch vehicles that generated more than  of revenues in amk welding reported record sales in as a result significant revenues from welding development work on a new ground based turbine that has not yet reached the production phase 
the absence of similar development work in resulted in the year to year sales decrease at amk 
gross profit 
gross profit for decreased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin decreased to in from in the gross profit margin for our explosion metalworking group decreased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to in from in the decrease in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to the sales decrease discussed above and the resultant less favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group is principally due to the sales declines experienced by both spin forge and amk welding 
spin forge reported a negative gross margin of in  a slight improvement from the negative gross margin of that it recorded in amk welding s gross margin declined from a record level of in to in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in approximately  of the increase in general and administrative expenses reflects increased legal  audit and board of directors expenses associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  activities surrounding the divestiture of pmp  and amendments to the company s articles of incorporation 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in this increased percentage is attributable to decreased net sales and higher year to year spending levels for our us operations 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in this increase in selling expenses is largely attributable to an increase in outside selling commissions associated with a large export order that nobelclad shipped during as a result of the increase in outside sales commissions and an unfavorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately  nobleclad europe s selling expenses increased from  in to  in selling expenses for our us operations decreased from  in to  in due principally to a decrease in bonuses earned by the us explosive metalworking group sales team 
as a result of the decrease in net sales and higher year to year selling expenses at nobelclad  consolidated selling expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in income from operations 
dmc reported income from operations of  in  a decrease of  from the  of operating income reported in this year to year decrease reflects a significant decline in operating income reported by our explosive metalworking group and an increased operating loss for our aerospace group 
our explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this significant decrease in explosive metalworking operating income is largely attributable to the sales decrease discussed above  which resulted in a  decline in reported gross profit  and higher selling expenses 
as we stated at the beginning of  with no large projects like the goro nickel project on the horizon  the explosive metalworking group would likely have difficulty matching its sales and operating income performance in this proved to be the case 
however  an improved year end backlog and strong booking levels during the early part of support the outlook for significant improvement in the group s sales and operating results 
dmc s aerospace group reported a loss from operations of  in compared to an operating loss of  in spin forge reported operating losses in excess of million in both and  with its operating loss being almost entirely offset by record operating income at amk welding 
amk welding s operating income in was less than half of that reported in as a result of the decrease in its sales 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease relates principally to a decline in interest rates during the year but also reflects lower average borrowings 
outstanding borrowings were reduced to  at december  from  at the end of related party interest expense totaled  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
dmc recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in on income from continuing operations as compared to a consolidated income tax provision of  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes or tax benefits associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary nitro metall 
the effective tax rate for is high because us taxes were provided at a rate on  of intercompany dividends received in from nobleclad 
the dividend income was eliminated in dmc s consolidated statement of operations  but us taxes are provided on such dividend income in the consolidated income tax provision without any offsetting tax credit as the recoverability of that tax credit does not meet the more likely than not test required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this increased the consolidated effective tax rate increased from an expected rate of approximately to an actual rate of 
income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased from  in to  in this decrease is principally attributable to the large decrease in income from operations as discussed above and an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in discontinued operations 
in august of  dmc announced that pmp was continuing to incur significant operating losses and that management would be considering alternatives with respect to pmp  including the potential sale or closure of the business 
on october   dmc completed the sale of its pmp division 
the sales price was  and is being financed through the issuance of a promissory note payable over a year period 
the sale included the inventory and property  plant and equipment of pmp 
the loss recorded on the sale of pmp  as well as the operating losses reported by pmp in  and  have been reported as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
the net loss from discontinued operations increased from  in to  in  with the net loss including a net of tax loss from operations of  as compared to  in and a  net of tax loss from the sale of pmp assets 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   dmc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income 
the company recorded a net loss of  in compared to net income of  in the net loss includes income form continuing operations of  and a loss from discontinued operations of  net income for includes income from continuing operations of  that was almost entirely offset by a loss from discontinued operations of  and a loss of  related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as further described above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for increased to  from  in sales by our explosive metalworking group  which include explosion bonding of clad metal and shock synthesis of synthetic diamonds  increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
explosive metalworking group results for and include net sales of nobelclad in the amounts of  and  respectively 
the increase in worldwide explosive metalworking group sales is principally attributable to more than million of shipments in support of inco s goro nickel project in new caledonia 
our aerospace group contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
this small increase reflects a sales increase at amk welding that was largely offset by a decrease in year to year sales at spin forge 
amk welding s large sales increase reflects a significant amount of revenues that it derived in from welding development work on a new ground based turbine 
the spin forge sales decrease relates a more than million year to year decrease in sales under a pressurant tank program for launch vehicles 
gross profit 
gross profit for increased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin increased to in from in the gross profit margin for our explosion metalworking group increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for the aerospace group decreased to in from in the increase in the gross profit margin for the explosive metalworking group is principally due to increased sales relating to the goro nickel project and the more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses that resulted from the higher sales volume 
the decline in the gross margin rate for the aerospace group is principally due to the poor sales performance of spin forge where a negative gross margin of was reported in compared to a positive gross margin of in the negative gross margin at spin forge was largely attributable to sales for this division being at a level that did not provide for full coverage of its fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to increased compensation expense associated with annual salary adjustments 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in due to the increase in sales 
selling expense 
selling expenses increased by to  in from  in the increase in selling expenses relates to increased compensation expense associated with higher bonuses for the explosive metalworking group and annual salary adjustments 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses decreased from in to in due to the increase in net sales 
income from operations 
dmc reported income from operations of  in  an increase of  or  from the  reported in this year to year increase reflects a significant improvement in operating results for our explosive metalworking group that was partially offset by the operating loss experienced by our aerospace group 
our explosive metalworking group reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase in operating income is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
dmc s aerospace group reported a loss from operations of  in compared to operating income of  in the group s operating loss is attributable to the previously discussed decline in sales and gross profit at spin forge that was only partially offset by excellent operating results at amk welding 
interest expense  net 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in this decrease relates principally to a decline in interest rates during the year but also reflects lower average borrowings during the latter part of outstanding borrowings were reduced to  at december  from  at the end of related party interest expense totaled  and  in and  respectively 
income tax provision 
dmc recorded a consolidated income tax provision of  in on income before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as compared to a consolidated income tax provision of  in this significant increase reflects an increase in the effective tax rate to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and nitro metall 
the tax provision in the us was low because dmc was able to generate enough taxable income in to allow it to fully recognize the tax benefits associated with operating loss carry forwards for which valuation allowances has been established as of december  income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle increased from  in to  in despite an increase in income before taxes of more than million 
the reason for this small increase in year to year income from continuing operations is attributable to an increase in the effective tax rate from in to in as explained above 
discontinued operations 
on october   dmc completed the sale of its pmp division 
the loss recorded on the sale of pmp  as well as the operating losses reported by pmp in  and  have been reported as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
the net loss from discontinued operations increased from  in to  in as a result of a significant decline in pmp s sales from to and an increase in pmp s pre tax operating loss from  in to  in a tax benefit of  and  was recognized in and with respect to pmp s operating losses using an estimated us effective tax rate of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
on january   dmc adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  we wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
net income 
the company recorded net income of  in compared to net income of  in this decline is attributable to the  goodwill impairment charge discussed above and an increase in the effective income tax rate to in from in liquidity and capital resources historically  dmc has obtained its operational financing from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
on june   our stockholders approved a stock purchase agreement between dmc and snpe  inc snpe 
the closing of the transaction resulted in a payment from snpe of  to dmc in exchange for  shares of dmc common stock at a price of per share causing snpe to become a majority stockholder of dmc on the closing date 
an additional  cash payment was made by snpe to dmc to purchase a five year  convertible subordinated note that is convertible in whole or in part into common stock by snpe at a conversion price of per share 
we also borrowed  on june  under a credit facility with snpe that carried interest at the federal funds rate plus and provided for maximum borrowings of  proceeds from the snpe equity investment  convertible subordinated note issuance and credit facility borrowings aggregated  and enabled us to repay all outstanding borrowings under a bank revolving credit facility on which the company had defaulted 
in connection with its july  acquisition of nobelclad  dmc entered into a  term loan agreement with snpe 
the term loan bears interest at the federal funds rate plus 
commencing september  and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter  principal payments of  are due  with a final principal payment of  being due on june  in anticipation of its acquisition by dmc  nobelclad acquired the stock of nitro metall and financed this acquisition with proceeds obtained from a term loan with a french bank in the amount of  euros  based upon the december  exchange rate 
this term loan carries interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 
annual principal payments of  euros begin on june  and are due on each anniversary date thereafter until final maturity on june  the bank has the option of demanding early repayment of any outstanding loans if groupe snpe s indirect ownership of nobelclad falls below 
nobelclad also maintains a million euro  based upon the december  exchange rate intercompany working capital line with groupe snpe under which borrowings of  were outstanding as of december  this intercompany line bears interest at euribor plus 
additionally  dmc maintains a  swedish krona line of credit with a swedish bank for its nitro metall operations 
as of december   there was  swedish krona in outstanding borrowings under this line of credit  based upon the december  exchange rate and the line has a variable interest rate  which was at december  in december  we obtained a  revolving line of credit with a us bank that replaced the  credit facility between dmc and snpe  inc this bank line of credit is being used to finance ongoing working capital requirements of our us operations 
initial proceeds from the bank line of credit were used to repay  of borrowings that were outstanding under the credit facility with snpe  inc the bank line expires on december  and carries an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a calculated borrowing base that is a function of inventory and accounts receivable balances and are secured by accounts receivable and inventories of our us operations and by new investments in property  plant and equipment with respect to us operations that are made during the term of the agreement 
as of december   borrowing availability under the line of credit was approximately million greater than the  in outstanding borrowings as of that date 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund working capital  debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
however  a significant portion of our sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to perform existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
consequently  any restriction on the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
dmc attempts to minimize its risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
risks associated with the availability of funds are minimized by borrowing from multiple lenders 
the nature of dmc s business is largely insulated from the negative effects of inflation on sales and operating income because the pricing on custom orders reflects current raw material and other manufacturing costs 
the company s existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets  limits on capital expenditures and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   the company failed to meet minimum book net worth and minimum net income covenants for its us operations under its revolving line of credit with a us bank 
at the beginning of  the lender established monthly  quarterly and annual financial covenants that were based upon company management s forecast of operating results for the respective periods 
covenant violations occurred as a result of an unexpected fourth quarter net loss that was largely attributable to lower than expected fourth quarter sales and operating income and a year end tax provision adjustment 
the company has obtained waivers from its lender for these violations and new financial covenants for have been established that are based upon management s forecast of operating results  cash flows and capital expenditures of the company s us operations 
therefore  as of december   the company is in compliance with all financial covenants and provisions of its debt agreements 
there is no assurance that the company will not violate financial covenants in the future and  in the event of a default  that the company will be successful in obtaining waivers

these sources were more than offset by the repayment of intercompany line of credit borrowings in the amount of  distributions to dmc s parent related to july reorganization of nobelclad nitro metall in the amount of  bond principal payments of  and dividends payments of  by nobelclad and nitro metall to nef  their former parent company 
future capital needs and resources we anticipate that  for the foreseeable future  significant amounts of available cash flows will be utilized for operating expenses to support our domestic and foreign manufacturing operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and other general corporate expenditures 
we expect cash inflows from operating activities to exceed outflows for the full year however  our success depends on the execution of our strategies  including our ability to secure an adequate level of new customer orders at all operating divisions  and continue to implement the most cost effective internal processes 
based on available cash resources  anticipated capital expenditures and projected operating cash flow  we believe that we will be able to fully fund our operations during in making this assessment  we have considered presently scheduled debt service requirements during  as well as the availability of funding related to our line of credit with snpe and our bank lines of credit  the anticipated level of capital expenditures in  and our expectation of realizing positive cash flow from operations in critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
revenue recognition 
the company s contracts with its customers generally require the production and delivery of multiple units or products 
the company records revenue from its contracts using the completed contract method as products are completed and shipped to the customer 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  the company provides currently for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by the company for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  the company estimates the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
in performing its asset impairment evaluation of spin forge fixed assets as of december   company management projected a return to profitability of this division in and subsequent years that would enable asset recoverability through the generation of future positive cash flows 
estimates of such future profitability and positive cash flows are partially dependent on the continuation of a missile motor case program that is currently on hold and future revenues from the successful development of new programs 
management believes its projection of future results are supported by realistic estimates of future sales volume under existing programs and new sales that should result from current new business development projects and recent quoting activities 
spin forge s projected return to profitability is also supported by the magnitude of the operating income that it reported in both and at sales levels below those that are projected for and subsequent years 
if actual results are significantly less than those projected by company management  the company may be required to record an asset impairment in the future 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
cost elements included in inventory are material  labor  subcontract costs and factory overhead 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the functional currency for the company s foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from the company s operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
impact of sfas no 
in june  the fasb authorized the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is to be performed on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as a sfas no 
operating segment or one level lower 
goodwill is no longer allocated to other long lived assets for impairment testing under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  they are carried at the lower cost or market value and tested for impairment at least annually 
all other recognized intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
dmc adopted sfas no 
as of january  and in early disclosed that up to the full amount of the remaining goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of pmp could be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  dmc completed its evaluation of goodwill impairment at pmp and determined that the remaining goodwill in the amount of  was impaired 
accordingly  the company wrote off all of the remaining pmp goodwill  less associated tax benefits of  and reported the resultant after tax loss of  or 
per diluted share  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those disclosed in the financial statements forming part of this form k  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties
