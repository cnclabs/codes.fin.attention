the audited financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december   and in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a global leader in the development  manufacture and marketing of rapid  accurate and cost effective nucleic acid probe based products used for the clinical diagnosis of human diseases and for the screening of donated human blood 
we have over years of nucleic acid detection research and product development experience  and our products  which are based on our patented nucleic acid testing  or nat  technology  are used daily in clinical laboratories and blood collection centers in major countries throughout the world 
in september  our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market immediately after our former parent company  chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd 
distributed all of its shares of our common stock to its shareholders 
since our spin off into an independent  publicly traded company  we have achieved strong growth in both revenues and earnings due principally to the success of our blood screening products which are used to detect the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type  or hiv  and hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
under our collaboration agreement with chiron corporation  or chiron  we are responsible for the research  development  regulatory process and manufacturing of our blood screening products while chiron is responsible for marketing  sales  distribution and service 
revenues we derive revenues from three primary sources product sales  collaborative research revenue and royalty and license revenue 
the majority of our revenues come from product sales  which consist primarily of sales of our nat assays tested on the proprietary instruments that serve as the analytical platform for our assays 
we recognize as collaborative research revenue payments we receive from chiron for the products we provided under our collaboration agreements with chiron prior to regulatory approval and the payments we receive from chiron  bayer corporation  or bayer  and other collaboration partners  including the national institutes of health  or nih  for research and development activities 
our royalty and license revenues reflect fees paid to us by third parties for the use of our proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   product sales  collaborative research revenues and royalty and license revenues equaled  and  respectively  of our total revenues of million 
product sales historically  our primary source of revenue has been the sale of clinical diagnostic products in the united states 
our primary clinical diagnostic products include our pace  accuprobe  amplified mycobacterium tuberculosis direct test  and aptima combo product lines 
we currently manufacture and ship approximately million tests per year for the diagnosis of a wide variety of infectious microorganisms  including those causing sexually transmitted diseases  or stds  tuberculosis  strep throat  pneumonia and fungal infections 
the principal customers for our clinical diagnostics products include large reference laboratories  public health laboratories and hospitals located in north america  europe and japan 
sales of our pace family of assays accounted for approximately of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in in  we began to supply nat assays for use in screening blood donations intended for transfusion 
our first blood screening assay detects hiv and hcv in donated human blood 
our blood screening assays and instruments are marketed through our collaboration with chiron under the procleix trademark 
we recognize product sales from the manufacture and shipment of tests for screening donated blood through our collaboration with chiron to blood bank facilities located in the countries where our products have obtained governmental approvals 
blood screening product sales are then adjusted monthly upon payment by chiron to us of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net revenue from sales by chiron to the end user  less the transfer price revenues previously paid 
net sales are ultimately equal to the sales of the assays by chiron to third parties  less freight  duty and certain other adjustments specified in our agreement with chiron  multiplied by our share of the net revenue  which was with respect to sales of assays that include a test for hcv beginning the second quarter of after implementation of commercial pricing  through april   after which our share of net revenues from sales of assays that include a test for hcv was adjusted to 
effective january   our share of net revenues from commercial sales of assays that include a test for hcv  such as the procleix hiv hcv assay and the procleix ultrio hiv hcv hbv assay  which received its community european  or ce  mark in january  was permanently changed to under our agreement with chiron 
with respect to commercial sales of blood screening assays under our collaboration with chiron that do not include a test for hcv  such as possible future commercial tests for west nile virus  or wnv  we will continue to receive reimbursement for our manufacturing costs plus of net revenues 
our costs related to these products primarily include manufacturing costs 
in february  the food and drug administration  or fda  approved our biologics license application  or bla  for our assay used to screen donated blood for hiv and hcv 
accordingly  we began to recognize product sales revenue for tests shipped in the united states in the second quarter of outside the united states  the procleix hiv hcv assay has received ce marking and approval in a number of other countries 
product sales also include the sales or rental revenue associated with the delivery of our proprietary integrated instrument platforms to customers for performing our nat assays 
we provide multiple instrument rental options to our customers depending on the types and volumes of products purchased 
instruments are manufactured by third party contractors  but we generally provide technical support and instrument service to maintain these systems in the field 
chiron is responsible for placement and servicing of instruments used in connection with our blood screening business and bayer and other international distributors are primarily responsible for placement and servicing of instruments used in our clinical diagnostics business outside the united states 
direct sales of our instrument platforms to customers accounted for approximately of our product sales for both the years ended december  and however  we generally retain title to the instruments and recover our instrument costs in connection with the sale of the assays 
the costs associated with the instruments are charged to cost of products sold on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the instrument  which ranges from three to five years 
the costs to maintain these systems in the field are charged to cost of product sales as incurred 
collaborative research revenue we have developed a nat assay to detect hiv and hcv in donated human blood and have also developed a semi automated instrument system to conduct the test 
these assays and instruments are marketed through our collaboration with chiron under the procleix name 
the procleix hiv hcv assays and instrumentation were used in clinical trials  under an ind from early through in february  the fda approved the procleix hiv hcv assays 
fda approval of the procleix hiv hcv assays has allowed chiron to implement commercial pricing for sales of the procleix hiv hcv assays to united states customers  which resulted in a significant increase in the revenues we received from such sales in the third and fourth quarters of and all of in march  we signed a definitive agreement with chiron for the development and commercialization of the procleix ultrio assay 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in reimbursements for expenses incurred related to the development of this assay 
we have also developed a nat assay to detect wnv  which is currently being used in clinical trials under an ind application 
we expect to receive further reimbursement for certain costs incurred during the development of the procleix ultrio and wnv assays from chiron and separately from the national heart  lung  and blood institute  a part of the nih 
we have recorded revenues related to use of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval as collaborative research revenue because price restrictions applied to these products prior to fda license approval in the united states and similar approval in foreign countries 
we began deliveries of the commercially approved procleix hiv hcv products to the united states customers in the second quarter of accordingly  we began to classify revenues associated with these products as product sales in our financial statements beginning in that period 
collaborative research revenue for the use of our procleix hiv hcv blood screening products for the year ended december  was million 
all sales of this assay in have been classified as product sales 
in addition  for the year ended december   we recognized million in collaborative research revenue through our collaboration with chiron from deliveries of wnv tests on a cost recovery basis 
we expect to continue recognizing these sales as collaborative research revenue until such time as fda approval has been received 
under the strategic alliance agreement we entered into with chiron in june  we have responsibility for research  development and manufacturing of the blood screening products covered by the agreement while chiron has responsibility for marketing  distribution and service of the blood screening products worldwide 
we received a million up front license fee from chiron in connection with the agreement in and an additional payment of million upon achieving an agreed upon contract milestone in additional payments of up to million are due to us in the future under the agreement if we achieve certain other specified milestones relating to the development of what we believe to be the world s first fully automated  integrated  high throughput nat instrument system known as the tigris instrument 
our costs to develop and commercialize the blood screening assays and associated instruments have been substantial and have had a significant impact on our operating results and financial position since we completed beta evaluations of the tigris instrument for clinical diagnostic applications and undertook initial beta trials for blood screening applications in the third quarter of and completed a clinical trial of the tigris instrument for diagnostic application in june we received fda clearance to run our aptima combo assay on the tigris instrument in december and  in january  commenced clinical trials of our procleix ultrio assay on the tigris instrument for a blood screening application 
in february  we commenced an arbitration proceeding against chiron in connection with our blood screening collaboration 
during the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a resolution to most of the disputed items and  in january  we received million in partial settlement of the claims 
during the first quarter of  we recognized million of the settlement in other income primarily for services provided in prior periods 
additionally  million of the settlement was a prepayment for inventory  all of which was recorded into revenues during the first nine months of the remaining million primarily represents the collection of an outstanding receivable 
the arbitration proceedings did not result in any disruption in service to our blood screening customers 
we are confident that any future disputes that arise between the companies will be resolved equitably through the dispute resolution procedures contained in the collaboration agreement 
in  we were awarded a million contract by the national heart  lung and blood institute  a part of the nih  to develop nat assays for screening donor blood for hiv and hcv 
in  the contract was modified with the addition of million for the development of a semi automated system for the detection of hiv hcv in pooled plasma and million for the development of hiv and hepatitis b virus  or hbv  tests 
in january  we began work on a three year million cost sharing contract with the nih to modify the procleix hiv hcv assay to incorporate hbv detection capability and make it simpler for organ donation centers to test the blood of organ donors 
the nih reimbursed us million of this cost  and we and chiron will share equally the remaining costs to complete the project 
all payments due to us under these reimbursement contracts have been received and were recorded as collaborative research revenues as reimbursable costs were incurred 
we received a million contract extension from the nih in october to develop a nat assay for the detection of the wnv 
the nih allocated an additional million to the contract extension in february billings under these contract extensions were completed in september in addition  in february  our initial ind application for the wnv assay was accepted by the fda 
testing on archived blood samples for wnv began in april we commenced wnv testing on current donated samples in june we initiated the development of this assay and have recognized collaborative research revenue under the contract extension as reimbursable costs were incurred 
in november  we received an additional million contract extension from the nih for the development of the wnv assay 
in  following the execution of our agreement with chiron  chiron assigned the clinical diagnostic portion of the agreement to bayer 
under the terms of our collaboration with bayer  we agreed to develop  manufacture and market nat assays for viral targets and cancer markers in the clinical diagnostic market with bayer 
we record product sales of the assays to bayer for use in clinical diagnostic applications at agreed upon transfer prices upon shipment to bayer 
we recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of our strategic alliance agreement with chiron as reimbursable costs are incurred 
the costs associated with the reported collaborative research revenue are reflected in our statements of income under the captions research and development  marketing and sales and general and administrative based on the nature of the costs 
we do not separately track the costs applicable to the blood screening development collaboration with chiron and therefore are not able to quantify the direct costs associated with the collaborative research revenue 
in november  we initiated an arbitration proceeding against bayer in connection with the clinical diagnostic collaboration 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement  bayer acquired the exclusive right to distribute nucleic acid diagnostic tests designed and developed by gen probe for the detection of hiv  hepatitis and other specified viruses  subject to certain conditions 
in the arbitration  we are seeking to prove that bayer has failed to fulfill the conditions required to maintain its exclusive distribution rights 
accordingly  we are seeking confirmation that the agreement grants us  in the present circumstances  a co exclusive right to directly distribute the viral diagnostic tests that are the subject of the agreement 
gen probe s arbitration demand also seeks money damages due to bayer s failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote  market and sell viral diagnostic assays developed by gen probe 
in november  bayer filed a counterclaim for money damages based on alleged delays in the development of the tigris instrument and certain assays  and other claims 
the matter has been set for hearing beginning on september  there can be no assurances as to the final outcome of the arbitration 
royalty and license revenue we recognize non refundable up front license fees over the performance period of the applicable agreement or at the time that we have satisfied all substantive performance obligations under such agreement 
we also receive milestone payments for successful achievement of contractual development activities 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if there are no remaining substantive performance obligations under such agreement and the amounts are non refundable 
in may  we entered into a worldwide collaboration with biom rieux  vitek  inc the collaboration involved research and development activities  as well as the transfer to biom rieux  pursuant to separate distribution agreements with biom rieux sa  of product distribution rights in international markets  excluding japan 
as part of these agreements  we licensed our nat technologies to biom rieux to jointly develop nat assays and adapt and develop instrumentation during a five year and ten year term 
in return  biom rieux paid us million of license and prepaid royalty fees in and an additional million of license fees in in august  we entered into amended agreements with biom rieux  inc that transitioned the relationship from a collaborative arrangement to a royalty bearing arrangement that covers semi automated probe assays and advanced  fully automated probe assays for the diagnosis of infectious diseases and detection of food pathogens 
under the terms of the amended agreements  biom rieux will pay us royalties based on sales of products incorporating the licensed technologies  subject to a minimum annual royalty payment  which began in january with respect to the semi automated probe assays and are scheduled to begin in with respect to the fully automated probe assays 
we will also receive a reduction in the royalties based on the amount of cumulative royalties that have been paid to us 
in addition  we transferred to biom rieux all information  trade secrets  procedures  methods  data and processes necessary for biom rieux to assume development of the products that are the subject of the agreement in exchange for the prepaid royalties paid under the original agreement 
accordingly  we recognized million and million in royalty fees related to this agreement in and  respectively 
in addition  we recognized million and million in minimum annual royalties in and  respectively  in connection with this license agreement 
we amortized previously received license fees in an amount equal to million annually through the period ended december  cost of product sales cost of product sales includes direct material  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead associated with the production of inventory on a standard cost basis 
indirect cost elements  which include manufacturing variances  purchase price variances  and allowances for scrap  etc  are also included as a component of cost of product sales  as well as certain related expenses  such as royalties  warranty  and instrument amortization 
in addition  we manufacture significant quantities of raw materials  development lots  and clinical trial lots of product prior to receiving fda approval for commercial sale 
during the blood screening development process for the procleix hiv hcv assays for the united states market  we also manufactured and delivered equivalent products for sale in international markets where governmental approvals had been obtained 
however  due to the relatively low initial sales volumes for these products in markets outside of the united states  we continued to charge the costs of manufacturing blood screening products to research and development expense  except for an amount equal to the product sales revenues recorded for international commercial sales  which was charged to cost of product sales and approximates the costs applicable to those product sales 
beginning in  the sales volume for the approved products shipped equaled or exceeded the estimated cost applicable to those product sales  and we ceased the allocation of the costs of manufacturing blood screening products to research and development expense 
as a result of the implementation of commercial pricing for our procleix hiv hcv blood screening assays in the united states  we have classified these costs as costs of product sales rather than research and development expenses 
during  our manufacturing facilities produced three wnv development lots and four procleix ultrio development lots 
additionally  several smaller scale wnv and procleix ultrio development lots were produced in our pilot manufacturing facility located at genetic center drive 
the costs associated with these development lots were classified as research and development expense 
during and  our blood screening manufacturing facility operated below its potential capacity and will continue to operate below its potential capacity for the foreseeable future 
this available capacity  as well as available capacity at our clinical diagnostics manufacturing facility  provides us with the opportunity to expand the manufacturing of both our own products and the products of other companies on a contract basis  without adding substantial fixed manufacturing costs 
during  a portion of this available capacity was utilized for development activities  as new product offerings are being identified for commercialization 
the costs associated with this excess capacity are included as a component of inventory and cost of product sales except to the extent that available capacity was utilized in the production of pre commercial development lots 
certain operating costs of our blood screening facility  together with other manufacturing costs for the production of assays that are delivered under the terms of an ind application are classified as research and development expense prior to fda approval 
research and development in recent years  we have invested significantly in research and development as part of our ongoing efforts to accelerate the development of new products and technologies  particularly our tigris instrument and our procleix ultrio assay for screening donated blood 
our research and development expenses consist of expenses associated with the development of proprietary products and instrument platforms  as well as expenses related to the co development of new products and technologies in collaboration with our strategic partners 
research and development costs in total are expected to increase in the future due to new product development  clinical trial costs and clinical manufacturing costs  however  we expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to decline in future periods 
the timing of clinical trials and development manufacturing costs is variable and is affected by product development activities and the regulatory process 
in connection with our research and development efforts  we have various license agreements  which provide us with rights to develop and market products using certain technologies and patent rights maintained by third parties 
these agreements generally provide for a term that commences upon execution of the agreement and continues until expiration of the last patent related to the technologies covered by the license 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of inventories  long lived assets including patent costs and capitalized software and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we record revenue from product sales on our blood screening products shipped to countries where regulatory approval has been received based on a contracted transfer price with our third party collaboration partner  chiron 
blood screening product sales are then adjusted monthly upon payment by chiron to us of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net revenue from sales by chiron to the end user  less the transfer price revenues previously paid 
we record revenues related to use of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval as collaborative research revenue 
we do this because price restrictions apply to these products prior to fda approval in the united states and in certain foreign countries 
as commercial pricing was implemented in the united states  we classified domestic sales of these products as product sales in our financial statements 
chiron began to implement commercial pricing in the united states for the blood screening products in the second quarter of commercially approved products that we began shipping in the second quarter of have been recorded as product sales based on the contracted transfer price with chiron 
based on the terms of our agreement with chiron  our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user will not be known until reported by chiron to us 
blood screening product sales are adjusted upon payment by chiron to us of amounts reflecting our ultimate share of net revenue from sales by chiron of these products  less the transfer price revenues initially paid 
product sales also include the sales or rental value associated with the delivery of our proprietary integrated instrument platforms performing our nat assays 
historically  we have provided our instrumentation to laboratories and hospitals without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into an equipment lease 
instead  we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation in the amounts we charge for our diagnostic assays 
the costs associated with an instrument are charged to costs of goods sold on a straight line basis over the estimated life of an instrument  which ranges from three to five years 
the costs to maintain these systems in the field are charged to operations as incurred 
we also recognize collaborative research revenue over the term of various collaboration agreements as negotiated monthly contractual payments are earned or we incur reimbursable costs related to the applicable agreement and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
negotiated monthly contracted amounts are earned in relative proportion to the performance required under the contracts 
non refundable license fees are recognized over the related performance period or at the time that we have satisfied all performance obligations related to the agreement 
milestone payments related to a particular milestone are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones when we have earned the milestone payment  the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and the fees are non refundable 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheet 
we recognize royalty revenue related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technologies under license agreements with third parties 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
for those arrangements where royalties are not reasonably estimable  we recognize revenue upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit losses historically have been minimal and within management s expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we record valuation adjustments to our inventory balances for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of such inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand and the shelf life and expiration dates for finished goods and materials used in the manufacturing process 
we operate in an environment that is regulated by the fda and other governmental agencies that may place restrictions on our ability to sell our products into the marketplace if certain compliance requirements are not met 
we have made assumptions that are reflected in arriving at our net inventory value based on the information currently available to us 
if future product demand  regulatory constraints or other market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory valuation reserves may be required 
we also manufacture products to conduct developmental evaluations and clinical trials and to validate our manufacturing practices prior to receiving regulatory clearance or for commercial sale of our products 
in these circumstances  uncertainty exists regarding our ability to sell these products until the fda or the other governing bodies commercially approves them 
accordingly  the manufacturing costs of these items in inventory are charged to research and development 
in cases where we manufacture products that are sold into approved markets and also maintained for further development evaluations for other markets  we may also provide valuation allowances for this inventory due to the historical uncertainties associated with regulated product introductions 
to the extent any of these previously manufactured products are sold to end users  we realize revenues  subject to any applicable adjustments in royalty rates under our collaboration agreements with chiron and others and reduce any inventory reserves that are directly applicable to such products 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is reviewed at least annually in the fourth quarter of each year 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreased market capitalization relative to net book value 
when there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
patent costs we capitalize the costs incurred to file and prosecute patent applications 
we amortize these costs over the lesser of the remaining useful life of the related technology or eight years 
at december   capitalized patent costs  which have been included in other assets on the face of the balance sheet  totaled approximately million  net of accumulated amortization 
we expense all costs related to abandoned patent applications 
historically  our expense related to abandoned patent costs has not been material but  if we elect to abandon any of our currently issued or unissued patents  the related expense could be material to our operations in the period of abandonment 
capitalized software costs we capitalize costs incurred in the development of computer software related to products under development after establishment of technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value and will be amortized over the estimated life of the related product beginning when the product is available for sale 
at december   capitalized software development costs related to our tigris instrument totaled million 
we completed beta evaluations of this instrument for clinical diagnostic applications and undertook initial beta trials for blood screening applications in the third quarter of and we completed a clinical trial for a diagnostic application in june we initiated clinical trials of our procleix ultrio assay on the tigris instrument for a blood screening application in january if we are not able to successfully deliver this instrument to the marketplace and attain customer acceptance  the asset could be impaired and an adjustment to the carrying value of this asset would be considered by management at that time 
we plan to begin to amortize the capitalized software costs in on a straight line basis over months during the second half of income taxes through december   we were included in the consolidated federal and in various combined state income tax returns of our former parent company  gen probe holding company  inc formerly known as chugai pharma usa  inc 
pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with gen probe holding company  we generally were allocated an amount of the consolidated tax liability equal to the tax that would have been applicable if computed separately 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million that are more likely than not to be realized 
other than a million deferred tax asset and an offsetting million tax valuation for assets acquired in the reorganization  no additional valuation is deemed necessary 
in connection with the merger of gen probe holding company into us  we recorded approximately million of deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets relate principally to financial statement depreciation in excess of that deducted for tax purposes and to research and development tax credits previously held by chugai pharma usa  llc  the successor to our former sister company chugai biopharmaceuticals  inc  which have been included in our combined tax returns 
these deferred tax assets are being carried forward and may be realized in future periods depending on  among other factors  whether we have sufficient taxable income in the future periods 
the deferred tax assets recorded are fully offset by a valuation reserve until these deductions and credits are realized 
net deferred tax assets of million relate to research and investment credits taken in our tax returns  timing differences arising from the recording of deferred revenue and certain reserves and accruals 
these amounts are offset by capitalized costs expensed for tax purposes and other items 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to reduce the deferred tax asset would be made in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth operating data as a percentage of total revenues years ended december total revenues product sales collaborative research revenue royalty and license revenue operating expenses cost of product sales research and development marketing and sales general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations total other income expense income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage product sales product sales increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in commercial sales of procleix blood screening products  both in the united states and international markets  and a million increase in std product sales 
procleix blood screening product sales represented million  or of product sales for the year ended december   compared to million  or of product sales  for the year ended december  we expect competitive pressures related to our std and blood screening products to continue into the foreseeable future  primarily as a result of the introduction of competing products into the market and continuing pricing pressure  particularly with our std products 
collaborative research revenue collaborative research revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in revenue for reimbursement from chiron of our development costs incurred on the procleix ultrio assay 
additionally  revenues increased by million in due to additional funds received from the nih in november to develop a nat assay for the detection of wnv 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in firm support commitment payments in connection with procleix tests provided to united states customers through our collaboration with chiron 
collaborative research revenue tends to fluctuate based on the amount of research services performed  the status of projects under collaboration and the achievement of milestones 
due to the nature of our collaborative research revenues  results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
our ability to generate additional collaborative research revenues depends  in part  on our ability to initiate and maintain relationships with potential and current collaborative partners 
these relationships may not be established or maintained and current collaborative research revenue may decline 
royalty and license revenue royalty and license revenue decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily the result of million in prepaid license fees and royalties from biom rieux which were fully amortized as of december   partially offset by a million increase in net license income from bayer for the licensing of rights to certain patented technology and a million increase in minimum annual royalties from biom rieux 
royalty and license revenue may fluctuate based on the nature of the related agreements and the timing of receipt of license fees 
results in any one period are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in the future 
in addition  our ability to generate additional royalty and license revenues may depend  in part  on our ability to market and capitalize on our technologies 
we may not be able to do so and future royalty and license revenue may decline 
cost of product sales cost of product sales decreased million to million  or of product sales revenues in  from million  or of product sales revenues in the million decrease in cost of sales principally consisted of a million reduction in manufacturing costs related to costs absorbed by research and development for the production of pre commercial development lots partially offset by a million increase in cost of sales attributable to increases in sales volume 
cost of product sales may fluctuate significantly in future periods based on changes in production volumes for both commercially approved products and products under development or in clinical trials 
cost of product sales are also affected by manufacturing efficiencies  allowances for scrap or obsolete materials  additional costs related to initial production quantities of new products after achieving fda approval  and contractual adjustments  such as instrumentation costs  instrument service costs and royalties 
our gross profit margin on product sales increased to in  from in the gross profit margin benefited by approximately million  or  of product sales  primarily from the implementation of commercial pricing in the united states for procleix blood screening products  as well as an increase in our revenue sharing percentage with chiron in the second quarter of additionally  our margin benefited from certain manufacturing costs absorbed by research and development for the production of pre commercial development lots 
effective january   we will have a decrease in our revenue sharing percentage with chiron  from to 
this change  combined with lower planned levels of development lots and higher instrument costs  including the amortization of our capitalized software development costs  and related service costs  attributed to the commercial launch of our tigris instrument  should result in lower future gross margin percentage levels compared to in addition  currently our non military customers utilize pooled blood screening samples for testing 
we anticipate that requirements for smaller pool sizes or ultimately individual donor testing  if and when implemented  could result in lower gross margin rates as additional tests would be required to deliver the sample results  unless a corresponding increase in sales pricing structure is implemented 
we are not able to accurately predict the extent to which our gross margin may be negatively affected as a result of smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing because we do not know the ultimate selling price that chiron  our distributor  would charge to the end user if smaller pool sizes or individual donor testing is implemented 
research and development our research and development expenses include salaries and other personnel related expenses  temporary personnel expenses  outside services  laboratory and manufacturing supplies  pre commercial development lots and clinical evaluation trials 
research and development expenses increased million to million  or of total revenues  in  from million  or of total revenues  in the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in the production of pre commercial development lots built and expensed during the year  including three wnv and four procleix ultrio development lots  and a million increase in salaries and temporary labor resulting from higher staffing levels 
marketing and sales our marketing and sales expenses include personnel costs  promotional expenses  and outside services 
marketing and sales expenses increased million to million  or of total revenues  in  from million  or of total revenues  in the increase in expenses was primarily related to a million increase in professional consulting and personnel costs in our marketing and sales force to support increases in sales for our clinical diagnostic products 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for finance  legal  public relations  human resources and business development  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal  patents and auditing services 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of total revenues  in from million  or of total revenues  in the increase was principally the result of a million increase in salaries and benefits resulting from higher staffing levels  including the acquisition of the majority ownership of molecular light technology limited  partially offset by a million decrease in professional fees primarily attributed to last year s spin off from chugai pharmaceutical

chiron began implementing commercial pricing for the sale of these products in the united states in the second quarter of revenues from the sale of these products are now classified as product sales in our financial statements 
we record revenues related to use of our blood screening products in the united states and other countries in which the products have not received regulatory approval as collaborative research revenues 
collaborative research revenue collaborative research revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in was primarily the result of a million decrease in firm support commitment payments recorded in in connection with tests provided to united states customers through our collaboration with chiron for pooled blood sampling under the terms of the ind application

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations through cash from operations  cash received from collaborative research agreements  royalty and license fees  the private placement of debt and cash from capital contributions 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million in  compared to net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million in our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  we paid million  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of a majority interest in molecular light technology limited 
in addition  our investing activities consisted of purchases  net of proceeds of million for short term investments and million for capital expenditures 
our expenditures for capital additions vary based on the stage of certain development projects and may increase in the future related to the timing of development of new product opportunities and to support expansion of our facilities in connection with those opportunities 
however  the average age of our property  plant and equipment is approximately five years  which gives us flexibility in planning capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  cash provided by investing activities consisted of million in cash received from our merger with gen probe holding company  inc  partially offset by million in payments made on our long term debt during during the year ended december   we received million from the proceeds of stock option exercises and purchases made through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
on a going forward basis  cash from financing activities will be affected by receipts from sales of stock under our espp and from the exercise of stock options 
we expect fluctuations to occur throughout the year  as the amount and frequency of stock related transactions are dependent upon the market performance of our common stock  along with other factors 
we have an unsecured bank line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which expires in july  under which we may borrow up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  at the bank s prime rate  or at libor plus 
we have not taken advances against the line of credit since its inception 
the line of credit agreement requires us to comply with various financial and restrictive covenants 
financial covenants include requirements as to tangible net worth  liabilities as a percentage of tangible net worth  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities  required minimum levels of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and maximum levels of pre tax and after tax losses 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in  we expect to commence the construction of an additional building at our genetic center drive location 
this new building will consist of an approximately  square foot outside shell  with approximately  square feet built out with interior improvements 
the additional space that will not initially be built out will allow for future expansion 
the project is estimated to take two years for completion and is currently estimated to cost approximately to million 
these costs will be capitalized as incurred and deprecation will commence upon our completion and use  which is planned for early we plan to implement a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  software system effective in  which is currently estimated to represent an approximate to million expenditure  the majority of these costs are expected to be incurred during further  we expect to incur approximately million to purchase tigris instruments that will be added to our installed base during contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations due to lessors for properties that we lease as well as other amounts due for purchase commitments as of december  were as follows amounts in thousands contractual obligations total operating leases material purchase commitment total reflects obligations on facilities under operating leases in place as of december  future minimum lease payments are included in the table above 
amounts represent our minimum purchase commitments from two key vendors for raw materials used in manufacturing and instrumentation 
does not include amounts relating to our obligations under our collaboration with chiron  pursuant to which both parties have obligations to each other 
we are obligated to manufacture and supply our blood screening assay to chiron  and chiron is obligated to purchase all of the quantities of this assay specified on a day demand forecast  due days prior to the date chiron intends to take delivery  and certain quantities specified on a rolling month forecast 
in connection with the joint development of the procleix hiv hcv assay  and as a condition for chiron s agreement to pay for most of the clinical trial costs related to approval of that assay  we agreed to pay the costs related to the clinical trial for the next joint development project with chiron 
our obligation is limited to the cost incurred for the previous joint clinical trial  which was approximately million 
as of december   we had incurred approximately million of clinical trial expenses and we anticipate these costs will continue through the end of our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for continued research and development of new products  costs related to commercialization of blood screening products and purchases of the tigris instrument for placement with our customers 
certain research and development costs are funded under collaboration agreements with partners or agencies of the united states government 
we anticipate additional funds from these sources as reimbursable costs are incurred  but these funds may not materialize and these relationships may not continue 
we believe that our available cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  additional debt financing may contain more restrictive covenants than our existing debt 
we may from time to time consider the acquisition of businesses and or technologies complementary to our business 
we could require debt financing if we were to engage in a material acquisition in the future 
in august  we filed a form s shelf registration statement with the sec relating to the possible future sale of up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in september  we repaid the remaining principal on the fixed rate financing of our headquarters building 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest income is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in short term investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to foreign exchange risk for expenditures in certain foreign countries  but the total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies at december  were not material 
we believe that our business operations are not exposed to market risk relating to commodity price risk
