item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters that are both very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that require some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions that  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause our future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management s current estimates 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers financial condition  our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
while these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we established  it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future 
inventory we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity of reserves for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
these reviews require management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the reserve required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we account for our goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we review the recorded value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value 
we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
the sfas goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
in step  we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows  and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital  which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows 
factors that management must estimate when performing this step in the process include  among other items  sales volume  prices  inflation  discount rates  exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these factors  and they include inherent uncertainties 
the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes  updated to reflect current expectations 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
if we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we must complete step of the impairment analysis 
step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and comparing it to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if 
table of contents the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
the variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events 
all such factors are interdependent and  therefore  do not change in isolation 
accordingly  our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if we had used other assumptions and estimates or if different conditions occurred in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
for example  based on available information as of our most recent review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  if our pre tax earnings were to have decreased by with respect to the pre tax earnings we used in our forecasts  the enterprise value of each of our divisions would have continued to exceed their respective net book values 
also  based on the same information  if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase by basis points the discount rate we used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  the fair value for each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value  except for the paperboard division 
if we had concluded that it was appropriate to further increase that discount rate by basis points  the fair value for each of our other reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value  except for the folding carton division 
under such circumstances where the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value  we would have completed step of the impairment analysis for that reporting unit 
we do not believe that such a change in the discount rate was appropriate at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal and no facts have come to our attention that would require us to perform an interim impairment analysis under sfas in connection with the closure of our facility in wright city  missouri  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal subsequently  we performed step of the sfas impairment test for the laminated paperboard products division  which at that time we had not yet consolidated with our mill division 
the results of our testing indicated the goodwill of the laminated paperboard products division was not further impaired 
in connection with the shutdown of the laminated paperboard product converting lines at our aurora  illinois  facility and our decision to close our otsego  michigan  facility in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed step of the impairment test for the paperboard division as required under sfas and determined the goodwill of the paperboard division was not impaired 
in connection with the closure of the st 
paul  minnesota  folding carton facility we announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed step of the impairment test for the folding carton division as required under sfas and determined the goodwill of the folding carton division was not impaired 
in addition  we completed the annual test of the goodwill associated with each of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal and we identified no indicators of impairment 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long lived assets is impaired 
the sfas test is a step test for assets that are held and used as that term is defined by sfas first  we determine whether indicators of impairment are present 
sfas requires us to review long lived assets for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset might not be recoverable 
accordingly  while we do routinely assess whether impairment indicators are present  we do not routinely perform tests of recoverability 
second  we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value 
this model requires management to estimate future net cash flows 
the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes  updated to reflect current expectations 
third  we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset 
the test is similar for assets classified as held for sale  except that the assets are recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less anticipated cost to sell 
other intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
most of the assets are amortized over periods of less than years 
we identify the weighted average lives of our intangible assets by category in note other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 

table of contents our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe no impairment indicators currently exist 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
we calculate our group insurance reserve based on estimated reserve rates 
we utilize claims lag data provided by our claims administrators to compute the required estimated reserve rate per carrier 
we calculate our average monthly claims paid utilizing the actual monthly payments during the trailing month period 
at that time  we also calculate our required reserve utilizing the reserve rates discussed above 
during fiscal  the average monthly claims paid fluctuated between million and million and our average claims lag fluctuated between and times the average monthly claims paid 
our accrual at september   represents approximately times the average monthly claims paid 
a change in the average claims lag would change our reserve by approximately million 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our group health insurance costs 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
a increase in our effective tax rate would increase tax expense from continuing operations by approximately million for fiscal while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our income tax exposure 
pension the determination of our obligation and expense for pension is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we describe these assumptions in note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein  which include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation levels 
during fiscal  the effect of a change in the discount rate would have changed income before income taxes by approximately million 
during fiscal  the effect of a change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have changed income before income taxes by approximately million 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we accumulate actual results that differ from our assumptions and amortize the difference over future periods 
therefore  these differences generally affect our recognized expense  recorded obligation and funding requirements in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and our future expense 
stock options we have elected to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options 
under apb  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  we recognize no compensation expense 
we disclose 
table of contents pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share in note shareholders equity of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
segment and market information we report our results in three industry segments the packaging products segment  the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment  and the paperboard segment 
in april  we consolidated our laminated paperboard products division and mill division under common management 
see business above 
the following table shows certain operating data for our three industry segments 
we do not allocate certain of our income and expenses to our segments and  thus  the information that management uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts 
we report these items as non allocated expenses 
these items include elimination of intercompany profit  restructuring and other costs and certain corporate expenses 
in april  we consolidated our laminated paperboard products division and mill division under common management 
we refer to the combined division as the paperboard division 
the paperboard division now consists of the previously consolidated specialty paperboard division  the former coated paperboard division and the former laminated paperboard products division 
as part of this reorganization  we moved our macon  georgia  drum manufacturing facility into our corrugated packaging division 
we also reviewed our allocation of internal costs and determined that it was more appropriate to designate some home office administrative costs as non allocated and to not allocate these costs to our operating segments 
we have restated the segment data in this report as a result of our review of the internal cost allocation and reclassified million  million and million of costs to the non allocated category for fiscal   and  respectively

table of contents overview during fiscal  we took advantage of strengthening demand for our products by capitalizing on our ongoing cost reduction efforts and investments in cost reducing technologies 
overall  net sales increased for the fiscal year compared to fiscal net sales increased in each of our segments in fiscal despite a pricing environment for our products that remains highly competitive 
in our packaging products segment  folding carton division net sales increased  both due to growth during the period in the portion of our business that was not attributable to acquisitions which we refer to as our internal growth and growth arising from the acquisitions that we completed during fiscal in the current margin environment for our folding carton division  competitive pricing pressure significantly offset the contribution from increased volume 
we expect competitive pricing pressures to continue during fiscal during fiscal  the strong growth in folding carton sales and the high capacity at which some of our folding carton facilities operated created some inefficiencies in our operations 
we expect to address these inefficiencies during fiscal  in part by reducing sales to our lower margin accounts 
based on our current expectations  which are impacted by the announced closure of our st 
paul  minnesota facility  we may see a modest decline in folding carton sales in fiscal net sales in our packaging products segment contributed by our interior packaging division increased primarily due to increased volume 
in our merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment  net sales of merchandising displays increased due to strong demand and sales to new customers as we expanded our presence in the north american display business 
the market for merchandising displays continues to reflect price competitiveness through more frequent bidding for business and increased demand for lower cost displays with more economical designs 
we continue to expand that business platform by broadening our permanent and multi material display capabilities as well as developing theft deterrent solutions for high theft products that are sold in various classes of retailers 
these theft deterrent solutions are in various stages of development 
in fiscal  our merchandising displays business completed a small acquisition to expand into mexico 
we expect our ability to leverage our joint expertise and our existing relationships with customers that also do business in mexico will allow us to grow the business in the coming years 
our corrugated packaging division net sales increased in fiscal due to increased volume and our acquisition of a corrugator in athens  alabama  in august the seller built the corrugator in december but operated it at much less than its capacity 
while the facility was losing money when we acquired it  we believe we can integrate this facility with our existing operations and establish a profitable growth operation in the growing southeastern marketplace 
our paperboard segment net sales increased during fiscal primarily as a result of higher selling prices and increased volumes 
although average paperboard prices were up per ton for the year  the price increase was less than the per ton increase in our fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs 
we expect to continue to see some further price increases in the first and second quarters of fiscal resulting from price increases we previously announced 
significantly higher costs offset the effect of increased net sales company wide 
at our recycled paperboard mills alone the aggregate costs of recycled fiber  energy  chemicals and freight increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  we closed several of our operations when we concluded that the operations were no longer cash flow positive 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our wright city  laminated paperboard products facility 
we did not consolidate the majority of the sales of this operation into our remaining laminated facilities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of the laminated paperboard product converting lines at our aurora  illinois  facility 
we did not consolidate the majority of the sales from these products into our remaining facilities 
we will continue to manufacture specialty recycled paperboard and solid fiber book and binder products at the facility 
we announced the closure of our otsego  michigan  recycled specialty paperboard mill effective july  we shifted approximately  tons  approximately one third of the volume of this facility  to our remaining recycled paperboard facilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our st 
paul  minnesota  folding carton facility 
we expect this closure to be effective in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to shift the majority of its production to our other folding carton facilities 
operating losses at our 
table of contents wright city facility  the laminated paperboard products operations of our aurora facility  our otsego mill  and our st 
paul facility for fiscal were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of these closures  we expect greater capacity utilization at our other operations  reduced aggregate costs and more efficient production operations  all of which we expect to be accretive to earnings 
our annual pension cost increased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal  primarily due to two factors 
costs increased million as a result of our reduction of the assumed discount rate from the fiscal rate of to the fiscal rate of  due to a decrease in the underlying benchmark index 
our net pension cost also increased million due to negative market returns in recent years 
see note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein 
during fiscal  we contributed approximately million to our retirement plans in order to maintain funded status according to internal revenue service guidelines 
in fiscal  we contributed approximately million 
in fiscal  we currently expect to contribute approximately million to million  an amount roughly equivalent to our pension expense for the year 
results of operations we provide quarterly information in the following tables to reflect trends in our results of operations 
for additional discussion of quarterly information  see our quarterly reports on form q filed with the sec 
net sales unaffiliated customers net sales for fiscal increased compared to fiscal due to net sales increases in each of our segments arising primarily from strong demand for our products 
packaging products segment net sales increased 
merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment net sales increased 
paperboard segment net sales increased 
net sales for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily due to growth in folding carton net sales 
packaging products segment net sales increased 
merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment net sales were lower primarily due to the september closure of our dothan  alabama facility 
paperboard segment net sales were relatively flat 
we have provided further information regarding factors that impacted net sales in the segment discussions below 
net sales aggregate packaging products segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions net sales of the packaging products segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal increased compared to fiscal net sales of the packaging products segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal increased compared to fiscal net sales aggregate by division packaging products segment folding carton interior packaging total in millions 
table of contents the increase in packaging products segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to sales growth in our folding carton division where sales were up from the prior year period 
approximately million of the million increase in segment net sales was attributable to our fiscal acquisitions and the remainder was primarily due to internal growth 
competitive pricing significantly offset the contribution from increased net sales 
net sales in our interior packaging joint venture increased million in fiscal primarily due to increased volume 
the increase in packaging products segment net sales before intersegment eliminations for fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of both higher volumes due to internal growth and the acquisitions of groupe cartem wilco inc which we refer to as cartem wilco and pcpc  inc  d b a pacific coast packaging corp 
which we refer to as pacific coast packaging by the folding carton division 
the two acquisitions contributed million of the million increase in folding carton net sales 
higher volumes were partially offset by lower prices in a highly competitive pricing environment 
our interior packaging sales increased million in fiscal due to increased volume and our ability to successfully implement a price increase due to paperboard cost increases 
we believe the increased volume was impacted by increased sales to beer and wine manufacturers  which increased significantly during the period in relation to sales to food glass manufacturers 
net sales aggregate merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions net sales of the merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal increased compared to fiscal net sales of this segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal net sales aggregate by division merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment merchandising displays corrugated packaging total in millions the increase in merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment net sales before intersegment eliminations for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in net sales of merchandising displays  which were up 
this increase occurred primarily due to strong demand and sales to new customers as we expanded our presence in the north american display business 
our corrugated packaging net sales increased or million due to increased volume and our athens acquisition in august  which contributed million in net sales 
the decrease in this segment s net sales before intersegment eliminations for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily the result of lower prices and volumes in the corrugated packaging division 
the lower corrugated packaging sales relative to the prior year period was primarily the result of the september closure of our dothan  alabama  facility and our sale of that facility s customer relationships 
net sales at corrugated packaging locations other than dothan increased over fiscal the increase in net sales of merchandising displays was primarily due to growth from the acquisitions we made in fiscal sales of merchandising displays increased despite a weakening in the market for promotional displays 

table of contents net sales aggregate paperboard segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions net sales of the paperboard segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal increased compared to fiscal net sales of the paperboard segment before intersegment eliminations for fiscal were relatively flat compared to fiscal net sales aggregate by division paperboard segment recycled paperboard fiber total in millions the increase in paperboard segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a increase in paperboard tons shipped and an per ton increase in our average selling price for all tons shipped 
during fiscal  our mills operated at of capacity compared to in fiscal total tons shipped in fiscal for the segment increased to  tons from  tons shipped in fiscal net sales of our recycled fiber division increased primarily due to increased fiber prices and volume 
sales of laminated paperboard products continued to decline as we continued to experience a decrease in demand for our products by customers in the ready to assemble furniture and book and binder industries  which during fiscal continued to be our primary laminated paperboard products markets  as well as continued competitive pricing 
net sales also decreased due to closures of our laminated plant facilities at the end of fiscal and second quarter of fiscal for fiscal as compared to fiscal  total tons shipped for the year were down slightly at  but net sales in the segment were stable primarily due to an increase in fiber prices over the prior year 
fiber price increases were offset primarily by competitive pricing for clay coated recycled paperboard and by declines in sales of our laminated paperboard products  as we continued to experience a decrease in demand for our products by customers in the ready to assemble furniture and book and binder industries 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased to  million of net sales in fiscal from  million of net sales in fiscal primarily due to million of net sales of increased fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs at our recycled paperboard mills 
fiber  energy  chemical and freight costs at our recycled paperboard mills increased million  million  million and million  respectively 
energy costs continue to be driven by higher natural gas prices 
in fiscal  we hedged most of our winter requirements for natural gas purchases at a nymex equivalent price of less than per mmbtu million british thermal units 
in fiscal  we hedged approximately two thirds of our winter energy purchases at a nymex equivalent price of approximately per mmbtu that resulted in a small benefit compared to the winter nymex contract close prices 
across our businesses we also experienced increased freight costs of million of net sales  excluding the million of recycled paperboard freight costs referred to above  increased group insurance expense of million of net sales  increased pension expense of million of net sales  and increased workers compensation expense of million of net sales during fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in freight costs was primarily due to increased volumes associated with our increased net sales and  to a lesser degree  increased fuel surcharges 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower expenses for maintenance and repairs of million 
we also partially offset the effect of these increased costs by leveraging certain fixed costs at our higher operating rates 
we

cost of goods sold increased to  million of net sales in fiscal from  million of net sales in fiscal primarily due to million of net sales of increased fiber and energy costs at our recycled paperboard mills 
fiber and energy costs at our recycled paperboard mills increased million and million  respectively 
energy costs continued to be driven by higher natural gas prices 
we have provided further information regarding factors that impacted cost of goods sold in the segment discussions included below under the heading segment operating income 
we value substantially all of our us inventories at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in  first out  or lifo  inventory valuation method  which we believe generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in  first out  or fifo  inventory valuation method 
in periods of increasing costs  the lifo method generally results in higher cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
the following table illustrates the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on our results of operations 
these supplemental fifo earnings reflect the after tax effect of eliminating the lifo adjustment each year 
fiscal fiscal fiscal lifo fifo lifo fifo lifo fifo in millions cost of goods sold net income our ability to work as an integrated business  as opposed to different units  has given us opportunities to reduce production overhead costs and to take advantage of economies of scale in purchasing  customer service  freight and other areas common to all of our facilities 
in  we continued the six sigma process that we introduced company wide during fiscal to reduce our variable manufacturing and transactional costs 
six sigma is a process improvement methodology that has a relentless focus on customer needs and delivering significant bottom line results 
it is a disciplined  data driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects in any process  from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service

bad debt decreased compared to the prior fiscal year due to lower total exposure to and improvements in the credit quality of several customers 
acquisitions in august  we acquired a corrugator located in athens  alabama 
the corrugator is capable of producing a variety of flute size configurations 
our athens acquisition will allow us to continue to grow our corrugated packaging division  better serve customers located in our market area and expand our geographic reach 
the purchase price of this transaction was approximately million 
we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting  which requires us to record the assets and liabilities of the acquisition at their estimated fair value 
the purchase price did not exceed the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired  therefore  we recorded no goodwill 
we included the results of operations of the athens operations in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is preliminary and subject to refinement 
the pro forma impact of the athens acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial results for fiscal included in the assets acquired are million of intangible assets 
the intangible assets consist of customer relationships and a non compete agreement 
we are amortizing the customer relationships over years and the non compete agreement over five years 
in january  we completed our acquisition of cartem wilco 
we acquired cartem wilco to strengthen our presence in the health and beauty and pharmaceutical packaging markets and to expand our folding carton operations in canada 
the purchase price of this stock acquisition  including out of pocket expenses  was approximately million 
in august  we completed our acquisition of pacific coast packaging  a folding carton manufacturer located in kerman  california 
the purchase price of this transaction including the assumption of debt was approximately million 
we acquired pacific coast packaging both for its geographic significance and for the way it complements our current customer base and growth strategy 
pacific coast packaging  our first folding carton operation on the west coast  is a low cost producer of folding cartons for the quick serve food  in store deli  stock and gift box markets 
we accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting  which requires us to record the assets and liabilities of the acquisitions at their estimated fair value with the excess of the purchase price over these amounts recorded as goodwill 
we included the results of operations from our cartem wilco and pacific coast packaging facilities in our consolidated results from the respective dates of acquisition 
the pro forma impact of these acquisitions is not material to the consolidated financial results 
in fiscal  included in the assets acquired were million of intangible assets and million of assets held for sale 
the assets held for sale represent the fair value of three small subsidiaries of cartem wilco that we sold effective december  the intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trademarks 
we are amortizing the customer relationships over a weighted average life of years 
we are amortizing the trademark over one year 
approximately million of the million in goodwill is deductible for us income tax purposes 

table of contents in fiscal  cash paid for purchase of businesses was million  which consisted primarily of the purchase price for the athens acquisition discussed above 
in fiscal  we completed our third party appraisals of pacific coast packaging  which we acquired in fiscal we reclassified million to goodwill  of which million was a reduction in the customer list intangible  million was an increase in property  plant and equipment  and million was a decrease in inventory 
in fiscal  we also completed the final adjustments to our fiscal cartem wilco acquisition and recorded million of additional goodwill 
we recorded million of goodwill in fiscal  approximately million of which is deductible for us income tax purposes

we do not allocate restructuring and other costs to the respective segments for financial reporting purposes 
if we had allocated these costs  we would have charged million to our packaging products segment  million to the paperboard segment  and million to our corporate operations and would have recorded a gain of million for our merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment 
of these costs  million were non cash 
facilities that we closed or announced that we planned to close during fiscal had combined revenues of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  including the laminated paperboard product converting lines at our aurora facility 
we cannot separately identify operating losses at our aurora facility because the facility manufactures other items and utilizes shared services 
however  we can reasonably estimate pre tax operating losses of the laminated paperboard products converting lines 
facilities that we closed or announced that we planned to close during fiscal had combined pre tax operating losses of million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively  including the laminated paperboard products converting lines at our aurora facility 
fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our hunt valley  maryland  and mundelein  illinois  merchandising displays facilities 
the closures resulted in the termination of approximately employees 
we consolidated the operations of these plants into other existing facilities 
in connection with these closings during fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge million  which consisted of million for equipment removal and relocation costs and other costs of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our dallas  texas  laminated paperboard products facility 
the closure resulted in the termination of approximately employees and we consolidated the operations of this plant into other existing facilities 
in connection with this closing during fiscal  we recorded a pre tax charge of million that consisted of an asset impairment charge of million to write down the equipment to fair value less cost to sell  and severance and other employee costs of million 
in addition  we had accrual adjustments totaling million of income resulting primarily from the reversal of certain accruals for severance and other costs at our closed laminated paperboard products plant in vineland  new jersey  and the earlier than planned sales of property at vineland and our closed folding carton plant in augusta  georgia 
expenses recognized as incurred from previously announced facility closings totaling million were attributable to equipment relocation costs of million primarily from vineland and a closed folding carton plant in el paso  texas  million due to changes in estimated workers compensation claims  a net gain on sale of property and equipment of million primarily due to the sale of the vineland and el paso facilities  and million in other miscellaneous items 
expenses recognized as

of these costs  million income was non cash 
facilities that we closed during fiscal had combined revenues of million and million and combined operating losses of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal during fiscal  we incurred restructuring and other costs related to announced facility closings 
during fiscal  we generally accrued the cost of employee terminations at the time of notification to the employees in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we expensed as incurred certain other costs  such as moving and relocation costs 
these restructuring costs include the closing of a laminated paperboard products plant in vineland  new jersey  a corrugating plant in dothan  alabama  and a folding carton plant in el paso  texas 
the closures resulted in the termination of approximately employees 
in connection with these closings  we incurred charges of million during fiscal  which consisted of asset impairment charges of million  severance and other employee costs of million  equipment relocation costs of million  carrying costs of million  and other costs of million 
facilities that we closed during fiscal had combined revenues of million and combined losses of million during fiscal we consolidated the operations of the closed plants into other existing facilities 
during fiscal  we incurred impairment charges of million when we permanently shut down our specialty paper machine at our dallas  texas  mill million and our no 
paper machine at our lynchburg  virginia specialty mill million  and determined that certain equipment in our folding carton division was impaired million 
we also recorded income of million during fiscal for closure events prior to fiscal  primarily for the gain on sale of building and equipment at our previously closed jersey city  new jersey  laminated paperboard products facility 
we do not allocate restructuring and other costs to the respective segments for financial reporting purposes 
if we had allocated these costs  we would have charged million to our packaging products segment  million to our merchandising displays and corrugated packaging segment  and million to the paperboard segment

partially offsetting the effect of these cost increases was the margin generated from increased sales in the segment that resulted from leveraging certain fixed costs at higher operating rates 
operating income attributable to the packaging products segment for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal our operating margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal despite increased net sales resulting from internal growth  the acquisitions of cartem wilco and pacific coast packaging in the folding carton division and increased volume in the interior packaging division 
higher volumes were more than offset by the highly competitive pricing environment and increased raw material and energy costs 
partially offsetting these higher costs was decreased bad debt expense of million in the segment

b in fiscal  for all prior periods  we revised the method of computation of the average recycled paperboard and corrugated medium prices and the weighted average recovered paper cost  and restated the amounts shown  to better reflect their impact on our segment operating results 
the average recycled paperboard and corrugated medium prices represent the average gross sales price per manufactured ton shipped adjusted for volume discounts and freight billed or allowed 
the average recycled paperboard and corrugated medium prices are not adjusted for payment discounts or sales returns and allowances 
the weighted average recovered paper cost represents the average cost of fiber per manufactured ton shipped  including related freight and brokerage costs

our laminated paperboard operations margins have declined due to reduced volume  competitive pricing  weakness in the ready to assemble furniture and book and binder markets and increased prices for paperboard

the changes we implemented as a result of this review resulted in a one time income tax benefit of million 
approximately million of the benefit relates to the filing of amended tax returns for fiscal years and and comparable adjustments made to the fiscal tax returns 
the changes related to certain income apportionment factors and a correction of an allocation of intercompany charges 
the impact of these changes was not material to our net income for any of the fiscal years in question  therefore  we recorded the cumulative impact in the current period 
the remaining million tax benefit relates to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance for net operating loss carry forwards which we refer to as nols and credits that we had previously concluded were not realizable 
we anticipate that the restructuring will allow us to realize the benefit of these nols in future years 
due to this one time tax benefit  our fiscal effective income tax rate is not comparable to our effective income tax rate in fiscal we estimate our marginal effective income tax rate for fiscal to be approximately 
provision for income taxes for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal decreased to from for fiscal the decline in the effective rate is primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill in fiscal  as a result of the adoption of sfas in fiscal  and the expiration of statutes of limitations with respect to prior tax years for state tax purposes that resulted in favorable tax treatment

in the first quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of our plastic packaging division and the sale of certain assets and liabilities that we acquired in the january cartem wilco acquisition that were associated with a small folding carton and label plant in quebec 
the plastic packaging division transaction closed effective october   and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
as a result of the transaction  in fiscal we recorded an after tax gain of approximately million 
the sale of certain cartem wilco assets and liabilities  effective december   resulted in no gain or loss and we received cash proceeds of approximately million 
we have reclassified the results of operations for these components as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to declining sales prices of case ready packaging  higher raw material costs  primarily resin  and a shift toward lower margin extruded roll stock sales

we have included the new disclosures in note retirement plans of the notes to the consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein under the heading retirement plans 
our adoption of sfas r did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued revised fasb interpretation no

we adopted this interpretation on march  for any variable interest entities which we refer to as vies in which we hold a variable interest that we acquired before february  we have not acquired any variable interests since that date 
the only vie in which we believe we hold a variable interest is the seven hills joint venture with lafarge that is discussed in note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements section of the financial statements included herein under the heading investment in corporate joint venture 
in november  the fasb released fasb statement no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter which we refer to as sfas 
sfas is the result of the fasb s efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued an exposure draft  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and which we refer to as fas r 
as proposed  fas r would require us to implement the proposed standard no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal fas r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
fas r would eliminate the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
as proposed  companies would be required to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements including stock options and employee stock purchase plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into various hedging transactions 
the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
there can be no assurance that we will manage or continue to manage any such risks in the future or that any such efforts will be successful 
derivative instruments we enter into a variety of derivative transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics on a portion of our outstanding debt 
we use forward contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in non functional foreign currency rates with respect to our operating units receivables 
we also use commodity swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling sales prices and rising raw material costs 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge  we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  in current earnings during the period of the changes in fair values 
for each derivative instrument that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  we report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassify that portion into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we recognize the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  in current earnings during the period of change 
we defer and amortize gains or losses on the termination of interest rate swap agreements as an adjustment to interest expense of the related debt instrument over the remaining term of the original contract life of the terminated swap agreements 
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments  we recognize the gain or loss in current earnings during the period of change 
we include the fair value of cash flow hedges in other long term liabilities and other assets on the balance sheet 
during fiscal  we realized cash proceeds of million by terminating interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and entering into comparable replacement interest rate swaps at then current market levels 
we do not expect any material impact on net income or change in interest rate risk from these transactions relative to our position before we entered into these transactions 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt 
we use swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt 
based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september  and september   if market interest rates increase an average of basis points  after considering the effects of our swaps  our interest expense would have increased by million and million  respectively 
we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
market risks impacting pension plans our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment 
adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities 
during fiscal and  the effect of a change in the discount rate would have impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
we have transaction gains or losses that result from changes in our operating units non functional currency 
for example  we have non functional currency exposure at our canadian operations because they have purchases and sales denominated in us dollars 
we record these gains or losses in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement 
from time to time  we enter into currency forward or option contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure 
as a result of the strengthening canadian dollar with respect to the us dollar  including gains and losses on forward and option contracts  we recognized a transaction gain of million in fiscal and recognized a transaction loss of million in fiscal to mitigate potential foreign currency transaction losses  we may utilize offsetting internal exposures or forward contracts 
we also have translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
as a result of the canadian dollar strengthening in relation to the us dollar  our translated  before tax earnings from our canadian operations were increased 
translated earnings were million higher in fiscal than if we translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
translated earnings were also million higher in fiscal than if we translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
commodities the principal raw material we use in the production of paperboard and corrugating medium is recycled fiber 
our purchases of old corrugated containers which we refer to as occ account for our largest fiber costs and approximately of our fiscal year purchases amount includes double lined kraft clippings  a source of recycled fiber  due to the high price correlation to occ 
the remaining of our fiber purchases includes grades such as old newsprint and boxboard cuttings 
from time to time we make use of financial swap agreements to limit our exposure to rising occ prices 
with the effect of our occ swaps  a hypothetical increase in total fiber prices would have increased our costs by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in times of higher fiber prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of the increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
solid bleached sulphate solid unbleached sulphate we purchase solid bleached sulphate which we refer to as sbs and solid unbleached sulphate which we refer to as sus from external sources to use in our folding carton converting business 
a hypothetical increase in sbs and sus prices combined would have increased our costs by approximately million during fiscal and by approximately million during fiscal in times of higher sbs and sus prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
linerboard corrugating medium we have the capacity to produce approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium at our st 
paul  minnesota  operation 
from time to time  we make use of swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling corrugating medium prices at our st

we estimate market risk as a hypothetical decrease in selling price 
with the effect of our medium swaps  such a decrease would have resulted in lower sales of approximately million during fiscal and approximately million during fiscal we consume approximately  tons per year of corrugating medium and linerboard in our corrugated box converting operations 
a hypothetical increase in linerboard and corrugating medium pricing would have resulted in increased costs of approximately million during fiscal and approximately million 
table of contents during fiscal we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
energy we spent approximately million on energy in fiscal converting all purchases into mmbtu million british thermal units  we bought approximately million mmbtu during fiscal natural gas accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total energy purchases in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million during fiscal we spent approximately million on energy in fiscal converting all purchases into mmbtu  we bought approximately million mmbtu during fiscal natural gas accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total purchases in fiscal without the effect of fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy would have increased our cost of energy by million 
we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we periodically evaluate alternative scenarios to manage these risks
