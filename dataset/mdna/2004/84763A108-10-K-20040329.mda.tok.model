item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in part ii 
unless the context otherwise requires  all references to the company  we  us  our  spectrum and spectrum pharmaceuticals refer to spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc and its subsidiaries  as a consolidated entity 
we primarily conduct all our activities as spectrum pharmaceuticals 
part i item business corporate background and business strategy spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc is a delaware corporation which was originally incorporated in colorado as americus funding corporation in december  became neotherapeutics  inc in august  was reincorporated in delaware in june  and was renamed spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc in december we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the business of acquiring  developing and commercializing proprietary and generic drug products which have a primary focus on the treatment of cancer and related disorders 
our business strategy since august has two principal components first  what we refer to as our oncology strategy  to acquire rights to clinical stage oncology drug candidates and either alone  or through alliances with other companies  develop and eventually commercialize those drugs  and second  what we refer to as our generic drug strategy  to seek to generate revenues from the sale of generic versions of drugs whose patent protection expires in the near term 
prior to august  when we announced a shift in our strategic focus  we were primarily engaged in the discovery and development of neurology drugs as well as functional genomics research 
our oncology strategy focuses on the acquisition  or in licensing  and continued development of clinical stage  novel drugs for the treatment and supportive care of cancer patients 
we currently have three drug candidates in clinical development satraplatin  eoquin and elsamitrucin 
of these product candidates  satraplatin is being co developed by a third party pharmaceutical company under an exclusive license  and the others are being developed by us 
we also plan to continue to pursue acquisitions  or in licensing  of additional clinical stage cancer drugs from other companies and institutions 
we believe that this method of drug development is a cost effective business strategy 
however  to date our oncology strategy has not produced any marketable products 
we intend  either alone  or through alliances with other companies  to market our oncology drug candidates if our clinical trials are successful and we obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
the strategic focus on clinical stage drug candidates those eligible for human trials is designed to address certain risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability  and reducing the risk of failure  both of which are higher with an early stage product 
further  in order to reduce our future financing needs to fund our oncology research and development  our plan is to generate revenues from the sale of generic versions of drugs coming off patent over the next several years 

table of contents our generic drug strategy is to identify and acquire distribution rights for selected generic drugs both directly and through alliances with third party companies  apply our expertise and experience to further develop and pursue regulatory approval for those drugs  then either directly or through third party alliances  market and distribute those generic drugs into retail and institutional channels 
during  we filed with the united states food and drug administration fda three abbreviated new drug applications anda for the generic drugs ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 
we intend to file several additional andas during and beyond 
we have entered into product supply and distribution alliances in order to manufacture and sell our generic drug candidates and intend to enter into additional alliances in the future 
we also have several neurology drug compounds that we intend to out license for further development because we are not pursuing internally  and do not presently intend to pursue internally  further development of these drug compounds  which include ait for dementia  sppi for attention deficit disorders  sppi for psychosis  schizophrenia and other mood disorders and neotrofin for neurodegenerative degeneration of the nervous system diseases 
drug candidates our drug candidates  their target indications  and status of development are summarized in the following table drug candidate target indication development status oncology satraplatin hormone refractory prostate cancer phase clinical trial began in september  fda granted fast track status in september eoquin superficial bladder cancer phase clinical trial began november radiation sensitization pre clinical elsamitrucin refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma phase clinical trial expected to begin in generics ciprofloxacin anti bacterial anda filed january carboplatin anti cancer anda filed october fluconazole anti fungal anda filed december while other indications have not yet been identified  some of our drug candidates may prove to be beneficial in additional disease indications as we continue to study and develop these drug candidates 
oncology strategy cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  accounting for approximately of all deaths 
in the united states  approximately million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in and over  persons are expected to die from the disease in accordingly  demand for improved and novel cancer treatments is very high 
cancer occurs when abnormal cells divide without control 
these cells can invade nearby tissues or spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body 
to percent of all cancers are believed to be due to inheriting a faulty gene 
the remaining to percent are believed to be caused by damage to the genes during a person s lifetime 
these damaging agents can be internal  such as hormones or an altered immune system  or external  such as viruses  tobacco  and exposure to chemicals or harmful ultraviolet sunrays 
sometimes ten or more years may pass between exposure and cancer detection 
cancer is treated by surgery  chemotherapy  radiation therapy  hormonal therapy and immunotherapy 

table of contents we believe that traditional chemotherapeutic agents are likely to remain the mainstay therapy for cancer for the foreseeable future 
however  we continue to seek additional novel drugs  delivery methods and combination therapies that address cancer or cancer related indications with significant unmet medical need 
accordingly  we are actively seeking novel and proprietary oncology drug candidates that have demonstrated initial safety and efficacy in clinical trials  target oncology  or cancer  indications with significant unmet medical need  where current treatments either do not exist or are not effective  and we believe are acquirable at a fair value based on our judgment of clinical and commercial potential 
we believe that our strategy of in licensing late stage oncology drug candidates with prior test data rather than developing early stage oncology drugs  enables us to better select drug candidates with promising potential 
since these drug candidates are further along the typical drug development timeline  we are better positioned to potentially generate product revenues earlier  if our clinical trials are successful and we obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
to date  we have in licensed three clinical stage oncology drug candidates discussed below 
we believe these drug candidates have the potential to be effective therapeutic agents with less adverse side effects than drugs currently on the market for the same indication 
our goal is to develop and  if successful  commercialize these drugs in the united states and worldwide 
satraplatin satraplatin  a third generation the first and second generation being cisplatin and carboplatin  respectively orally administered platinum derived chemotherapy agent  is being developed by our co development partner gpc biotech ag frankfurt stock exchange gpc as a second line chemotherapy treatment for its initial indication  hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc 
cancer is referred to as refractory when it has not responded or is no longer responding to previous treatment 
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men 
according to figures released by the american cancer society  approximately  new cases and  deaths will occur in the us during the initial treatment of prostate cancer includes surgery along with radiation therapy and hormonal therapy 
although hormonal therapy is generally very effective  and produces a response in most patients  it is non curative 
the average duration of response to initial hormonal treatment is eighteen months 
once the disease progresses after the initial hormonal treatment  it is considered hormone refractory 
for those patients failing hormone therapy  treatment currently involves chemotherapy which is also non curative and is limited to improvement of symptoms of cancer without any significant prolongation of survival 
platinum compounds  like satraplatin  continue to represent one of the most widely used classes of chemotherapeutic agents in modern cancer therapy and are typically used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various types of cancer including prostate cancer 
while the platinum compounds currently on the market are intravenously administered  satraplatin is an orally administered compound 
we believe an orally administered platinum derived chemotherapeutic agent may offer important clinical and commercial advantages over platinum drugs that need to be intravenously administered in a hospital setting  including ease of administration and patient convenience 
these advantages  in turn  could potentially lead to improved patient compliance as well as potential cost savings to patients and the healthcare system 
a pivotal phase trial  the sparc satraplatin and prednisone against refractory cancer trial for satraplatin in hrpc  was initiated by gpc biotech in september  following completion of an assessment by a special committee of the fda 
also in september  the fda granted fast track designation to satraplatin as a second line chemotherapy for patients with hrpc 
in february  gpc biotech announced the receipt of a scientific advice letter from the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea enabling the phase pivotal trial on satraplatin to proceed in europe using the sparc protocol 

table of contents the decision to pursue hrpc as the initial indication for satraplatin was based  among other things  on results from a randomized  patient study initiated in june in first line chemotherapy for hrpc sponsored by bristol myers squibb that were presented at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in june the data demonstrated statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression and doubling of progression free survival in the satraplatin treated group compared to the control group in addition to hrpc  satraplatin has shown initial indication of anti tumor activity in ovarian and small cell lung cancer  among others  in phase trials conducted to date 
in august  we in licensed satraplatin from its developer  johnson matthey plc  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments to be made based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties based on any net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
in september  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech for further development and commercialization of satraplatin 
under the terms of this agreement  gpc biotech agreed to fully fund the development expenses for satraplatin  and to pay us an initial license fee of million  including million received upon signing  and million in cash and million as an equity investment in shares of our common stock received in the fourth quarter of  following the initial dosing of the first patient treated in the ongoing phase study 
we may receive additional payments based upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones  as well as royalties on any future sales 
the development plans for satraplatin are established by a joint development committee with members from both spectrum and gpc biotech  however  members from gpc biotech represent a majority of the committee and the final procedures are effectively decided and implemented by gpc biotech 
we have the ability to perform additional studies  if so desired  at our expense 
eoquin eoquin eo  apaziquone  a synthetic prodrug an inactive drug compound which is activated by certain enzymes present in higher amounts in cancer cells than in normal tissues  is currently being developed for its initial indication  superficial bladder cancer  or cancer which has not invaded the muscle of the bladder wall 
the american cancer society estimates that there will be  new cases and  deaths from bladder cancer in in the us superficial bladder cancer accounts for to percent of all cases of bladder cancer at first diagnosis 
the initial treatment of this cancer is surgical removal of the tumor 
because of the high frequency of early recurrences of the tumor  patients are usually prescribed additional therapy to prevent or delay such recurrences 
this additional therapy generally consists of immunotherapy or chemotherapy drugs instilled directly into the bladder 
since eoquin is activated preferentially within tumor cells  we believe it carries a lesser risk of killing or harming normal body cells 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a multi national  multi center phase clinical trial 
the decision to initiate phase trials in this indication was based  among other things  on results from phase trials that demonstrated that eoquin was safe  with no systemic toxicity  and was well tolerated at the dose level chosen for the phase trials 
more importantly  eoquin demonstrated an initial indication of anti tumor activity against superficial bladder cancer  as evidenced by six of eight patients showing a complete response complete disappearance of the tumor as confirmed by biopsy after receiving six treatments with eoquin over a period of six weeks 
of these six patients  none has experienced a recurrence  and two were free of tumor recurrence at the end of months 
one of the purposes of the ongoing phase trials is to determine the level of anti tumor activity in a larger number of patients 
we have also initiated an investigation of whether eoquin may have potential utility as a radiation sensitizer in the treatment of certain cancers 
radiotherapy along with chemotherapy has been the primary treatment for a number of cancers 
certain types of cancer cells can be primed through pre treatment by a radiation sensitizer to respond better to radiation therapy 
in  we in licensed eoquin and numerous related derivates from the nddo research foundation in the netherlands  in exchange for an up front fee  additional payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 

table of contents elsamitrucin elsamitrucin  an anti tumor antibiotic that acts as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes involved in dna replication  topoisomerase i and ii  is currently being developed for its initial indication  refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma 
non hodgkin s lymphoma is a tumor arising from the lymph nodes 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  new cases and  deaths will occur from non hodgkin s lymphoma in in the us in early stages  localized diseased lymph nodes can be treated with radiation therapy 
later stages of this disease are treated with chemotherapy or with chemotherapy plus radiation and highly specific monoclonal antibodies depending on the type of non hodgkin s lymphoma 
we believe elsamitrucin may prove to be an important addition in treating refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma patients because it has shown some activity when used alone and it has exhibited a relatively low level of associated toxicity 
by inhibiting the activity of the two key enzymes involved in dna replication  elsamitrucin is thought to lead to dna breaks that prevent the correct replication of dna and ultimately result in cancer cell death 
we plan to initiate an approximately patient  phase trial in patients with refractory non hodgkin s lymphoma  during the second quarter of in clinical trials conducted to date  elsamitrucin has also demonstrated a favorable side effect profile  notably  minimal toxicity to bone marrow 
we in licensed elsamitrucin from its developer  bristol myers squibb  in  in exchange for an upfront fee  additional payments based upon achievement of milestones and a royalty based on net sales  if and when a commercial drug is approved and sales are initiated 
generic drug strategy as a result of the number of branded pharmaceutical products coming off patent over the next decade  combined with the aging us population and cost containment efforts by the us federal government and private insurance payors  we believe the us market for generic drugs will display continued growth 
we hope to capitalize on that growth and generate revenues to help fund our oncology research and development 
once we identify a generic drug candidate and secure a possible supplier of either the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the drug or the dosage form  we begin our own development and initiate regulatory approval processes 
for generic drugs  the regulatory approval process includes preparation and submission to the us food and drug administration fda of an abbreviated new drug application anda 
the anda is a process created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of for the accelerated approval of generic drugs 
among the many topics that must be covered in an anda is a demonstration that the generic drug has both bio equivalence  which means that the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the previously approved branded drug  and chemical equivalence to the reference listed brand name product  and that distribution of the generic drug will not infringe any existing patent s or is otherwise lawful 
during  we filed andas for ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 
we have identified additional generic drugs that we believe represent desirable market opportunities and we intend to file several additional andas during and beyond 
future anda filings may be prepared directly through our internal development program  or jointly with current or new business alliance partners 
the success of our generic drug strategy depends significantly upon our relationships with our active pharmaceutical ingredient or dosage form suppliers based in india and other countries and our ability to develop and expand distribution channel relationships in the united states because we currently have no internal manufacturing or distribution capabilities 
we believe our relations with our existing partners to be good  and we believe those relationships provide a good foundation for launching our generic drug strategy 
the long term success of our generic drug strategy  however  depends in significant part on our ability to continue to improve and expand our existing relationships and establish new relationships with additional drug source and distribution partners  and otherwise enlarge and enhance our generic drug distribution capability  particularly in the united states 

table of contents business alliances in seeking business alliances in connection with our generic drug strategy  we have focused  in particular  on seeking alliances with active pharmaceutical ingredient and dosage form companies based in india that have demonstrated expertise and capability to produce high quality products cost effectively with sufficient production capability to supply a distribution program in the united states 
in addition  we have focused on seeking alliances with distribution companies with the necessary experience and expertise to market and distribute our generic drug candidates 
during we will continue to seek new alliances in india and elsewhere to expand the portfolio of generic drug candidates available to us and advance our overall generic drug strategy 
the following are our current business alliance partners jb chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd 
jbcpl operates manufacturing facilities in india  which produce active pharmaceutical ingredients  intermediates building blocks in chemical compounds  finished dosage form pharmaceuticals and herbal remedies 
jbcpl s products are marketed in over countries 
jbcpl has been a participant in the pharmaceutical industry for more than years 
in  spectrum and jbcpl formed a joint venture named neojb llc  a delaware limited liability company 
neojb is and owned by spectrum and a subsidiary of jbcpl  respectively 
in conjunction with the formation of neojb  we granted a five year warrant to jbcpl to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
through neojb  we intend to utilize jbcpl s drug manufacturing capabilities to produce selected generic drug products and to market those generic drugs in the united states 
in  neojb entered into an agreement with jbcpl under which jbcpl granted neojb an exclusive license to obtain regulatory approval for market and distribute certain products  including ciprofloxacin and fluconazole  within the united states 
the agreement contemplates  and the parties expect  that additional products may be added to the agreement from time to time 
the agreement provides that we  or neojb  will bear all costs of regulatory approvals for the products and that jbcpl will manufacture and supply to neojb the products in such quantities as neojb may require at prices reasonably acceptable to both parties 
the agreement provides that jbcpl shall not enter into any distribution or sale arrangement or grant any license with respect to any product covered by the agreement in the united states unless it first offers to enter into a supply agreement with neojb pursuant to certain procedures and conditions 
in addition  the agreement provides that neojb shall not  for years from the later of the termination of the agreement or expiration of the applicable patents  market in the united states any products which would compete with the distribution  marketing or sale of the products covered by the agreement 
the agreement continues so long as jbcpl or any of its affiliates is a member of neojb or until jointly terminated by the parties 
under our alliance agreement with jbcpl  an entity affiliated with jbcpl agreed to invest million in our common stock 
the first  was invested in following acceptance by the fda of our anda filing for ciprofloxacin  for  shares of our common stock at a price per share of equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately prior to the date of acceptance of the anda by the fda  and the remaining  will be invested if and when the anda is approved  at a price per share equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately prior to the date of approval of the anda by the fda 
fdc limited  based in mumbai  india  has been manufacturing pharmaceuticals for over years 
fdc limited manufactures  among other products  active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain oral  ophthalmic and otic drugs at their manufacturing facilities  and is actively selling certain active pharmaceutical ingredients produced at their fda approved facilities in india into the united states market 
in  spectrum and fdc limited entered into an agreement under which spectrum  on behalf of fdc limited  will prepare and file with the fda one or more andas for certain ophthalmic drugs manufactured by fdc  and thereafter  if the anda is approved by the fda  market those products in the united states as fdc s exclusive distributor either directly or through third parties 
the agreement 
table of contents contemplates  and the parties expect  that additional products may be added to the agreement from time to time 
the agreement provides that all product registrations and andas for drugs covered by the agreement shall be obtained by us in fdc s name at our cost and that fdc will manufacture and supply to us the products in such quantities as we may require at prices reasonably acceptable to both parties 
the agreement continues until jointly terminated by the parties 
however  either party may terminate the agreement upon material breach by the other party or upon the failure to reach certain milestones within specified time periods 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement upon failure to agree to a mutually satisfactory supply price with respect to the products  in which case fdc is prohibited from selling such products within the united states for a price less than that offered to us under the agreement 
lannett company  inc  based in philadelphia  is a pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution company that markets and distributes generic drugs 
in august  we entered into an agreement with lannett under which it will be our exclusive distributor for ciprofloxacin in the united states 
the agreement provides that the parties shall mutually agree on an annual minimum amount of ciprofloxacin that lannett must use its commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell in the united states 
the agreement contemplates  and the parties expect  that additional products may be added to the agreement from time to time 
lannett agrees that if it decides to distribute any products other than ciprofloxacin under this agreement  that it will not  without our prior written consent  market  distribute or sell any product that competes with such additional products 
the agreement continues for months after the date upon which we are first allowed to sell ciprofloxacin in the united states  unless renewed by mutual agreement 
generic products the following are our current generic drug candidates ciprofloxacin 
ciprofloxacin is a synthetic  broad spectrum anti bacterial agent that is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of microorganisms in certain diseases 
ciprofloxacin is available in multiple dosage forms including tablets  oral suspension  otic  intravenous infusion and ophthalmic preparations 
in march  through our affiliate neojb and on behalf of jbcpl our joint venture partner in neojb  we filed an anda for ciprofloxacin tablets 
although no assurance can be given  we hope to receive fda approval during our ciprofloxacin tablets will be manufactured by jbcpl utilizing its fda approved facility in india 
the total us market size for the branded form of ciprofloxacin  cipro  is estimated at over billion dollars 
however  because the brand name company retains some portion of the unit market for the branded product post patent expiration and may introduce innovative dosage forms of the branded product such as extended release forms before or immediately following patent expiration of the branded drug  the market size for the generic drug is usually smaller than the market for the branded form of the drug 
the us patent for cipro  held by bayer pharmaceuticals corp 
expired in december the fda granted pediatric exclusivity discussed below under patents and proprietary rights to bayer which expires in june we intend to begin marketing and selling the tablet dosage form of ciprofloxacin through our alliance with lannett if and when anda approval is given by the fda and following the expiration of the pediatric exclusivity period 
carboplatin 
carboplatin is an anti cancer drug indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents and for the palliative treatment of patients with ovarian cancer recurrent after prior chemotherapy  including patients treated with cisplatin  another chemotherapeutic agent 
in october  we filed an anda for an injectable form of carboplatin 
the total us market size for the branded form of carboplatin  paraplatin  is estimated at over million 
the us patent for paraplatin  held by bristol myers squibb co  expires in april if fda approval for our anda is obtained  we intend to begin marketing and sales of carboplatin immediately following such approval and the expiration of the patent 
we will likely use one or more third party distributors with particular experience distributing injectable oncology drugs to carry out our distribution plan 
we cannot at this time  however  provide any assurance that we either will establish distributor arrangements with third party distributors or will be able to acquire the necessary quantities of the drug from our supply sources on commercially feasible terms or terms otherwise acceptable to us 

table of contents fluconazole 
fluconazole is a synthetic anti fungal agent indicated for the treatment of localized and systemic fungal infections 
fluconazole is available in multiple dosage forms including tablets  oral suspension and intravenous infusion 
in december  through neojb  we filed an anda for fluconazole tablets on behalf of jbcpl 
we have entered into a supply agreement with jbcpl pursuant to which jbcpl will manufacture fluconazole for neojb utilizing jbcpl s fda approved facility in india 
the total us market size for the branded form of fluconazole  diflucan  is estimated at over million 
the original patent for diflucan  held by pfizer inc  expired on january  the fda granted pediatric exclusivity to pfizer until july  following the expiration of the pediatric exclusivity period and subject to fda approval of our anda  we intend to begin marketing and selling fluconazole using one or more third party distributors with experience selling generic drug products into retail and institutional channels 
we cannot provide assurance at this time that we will successfully establish distributor arrangements with a qualified third party distributor for this generic drug product 
patents and proprietary rights the patent process the united states constitution provides congress with the authority to secure for limited times to inventors the exclusive right to their discoveries 
congress codified this right in united states code title which gave the patent office the right to grant patents to inventors and defined the process for securing a us patent 
this process involves the filing of a patent application that teaches a person having ordinary skill in the respective art how to make and use the invention in clear and concise terms 
the invention must be novel not previously known and non obvious not an obvious extension of what is already known 
the patent application concludes with a series of claims that specifically describe the subject matter that the patent applicant considers his invention 
the patent office undertakes an examination process that can take from one to five years depending on the complexity of the patent and the problems encountered during examination 
generally  the less novel an invention is  the longer the examination process will last 
in exchange for disclosing the invention to the public  the successful patent applicant is provided a right to exclude others from making  using or selling the claimed invention for a period of years from the filing date of the patent application 
under certain circumstances a patent term may be extended 
patent extensions are most frequently granted in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under the drug price competition and pricing term restoration act of  to recover some of the time lost during the fda regulatory process  subject to a number of limitations and exceptions 
the patient term may be extended up to a maximum of five years  however  as a general rule  the average extension period granted for a new drug is approximately three years and approximately months for a new medical device 
only one patent can be extended per fda approved product and a patent can only be extended once 
generic drugs and pediatric exclusivity as an incentive for pharmaceutical companies to research the safety and efficacy of their brand name drugs for use in pediatric populations  congress enacted the food drug administration modernization act of which included a pediatric exclusivity for brand name drugs 
this pediatric exclusivity protects drug products from generic competition for six months after their patents expire in exchange for research on children 
for example  if a pharmaceutical company owns a patent covering a brand name drug they can only exclude third parties from selling generic versions of that drug until that patent expires 
however  if the fda grants a brand named drug pediatric exclusivity the fda will not approve of the sale of any generic drugs for six months beyond the patent term covering the brand name drug 
thus  the pediatric exclusivity effectively extends the brand named company s patent protection for six months 
this extension applies to all dosage forms and uses that the original patent s covered 

table of contents our patent and proprietary rights we in license from third parties certain patent and related intellectual property rights 
in particular  we have licensed rights with respect to satraplatin  eoquin and elsamitrucin from johnson matthey plc  the nddo research foundation in the netherlands and bristol myers squibb  respectively  in each case for the remaining life of the applicable patents 
our agreements provide us with exclusive worldwide rights to  among other things  develop  sublicense  and sell the drug candidates 
we are responsible for all development  patent filing and maintenance costs except with regard to patent filing and maintenance costs for satraplatin  sales  marketing and liability insurance costs 
our protection  preservation and infringement free commercial exploitation of these patents and related intellectual property rights is very important to the successful execution of our oncology strategy 
in connection with our generic drug strategy  we have filed andas for ciprofloxacin and fluconazole on behalf of jbcpl 
jbcpl will own the andas and we will have the exclusive license to market and distribute those drugs within the united states 
we filed our own anda for carboplatin and we plan to file other andas in the future for our own account and on behalf of others 
we also hold us and foreign patent rights related to our neurology drug candidates 
all neurology patents were assigned to us by the inventors  including dr 
alvin glasky a former chairman and ceo of the company and mcmaster university  for certain royalty payments 
we intend to out license these patent rights for further development because we are not pursuing internally  and do not presently intend to pursue internally  further development of any products based on the neurology patents 
in addition to the specific intellectual property subjects discussed above  we have filed for certain trademark protections 
in conducting our business generally  we rely upon trade secrets  know how  licensing arrangements and appropriate and customary practices for the protection of our confidential and proprietary information 
please also read our discussion of patent and intellectual property matters in the risk factors section of this report 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition 
many companies of all sizes  including a number of large pharmaceutical companies as well as many specialized pharmaceutical companies  engage in drug development activities and generic drug marketing activities similar to ours 
our oncology strategy competitors that have products on the market or in research and development that are in the same clinical focus as us include amgen  inc  bayer ag  eli lilly and co  novartis pharmaceuticals corporation  bristol myers squibb company  glaxo smithkline  biogen idec pharmaceuticals  inc  guilford pharmaceuticals  inc  cephalon  inc  aventis pharmaceuticals inc  pfizer  inc  avi biopharma  inc  chiron corp  corixa corp  genta inc  imclone systems incorporated  mgi pharma  inc and supergen  inc  among others 
many of our competitors are large and well capitalized companies such as eli lilly and co 
and bristol myers squibb focusing on a wide range of diseases and drug indications  and have substantially greater financial  research and development  human and other resources than we do 
furthermore  large pharmaceutical companies have significantly more experience than we do in pre clinical testing  human clinical trials and regulatory approval procedures  among other things 
technologies under development by these and other pharmaceutical companies could result in treatments for diseases and disorders for which we are developing our own treatments 
several other companies are engaged in research and development of compounds that are similar to our research 
in the event that one or more of these programs is successful  the market for some of our drug candidates could be reduced or eliminated 
companies that have a significant generic presence include american pharmaceutical partners  bedford laboratories  barr laboratories  sicor  inc  teva pharmaceuticals and watson pharmaceuticals  inc 
some 
table of contents additional competitors in the generics market include eon labs  inc  pliva  inc  impax laboratories  inc 
and akorn  inc  a competitor particularly in the field of generic ophthalmic drugs 
the generic market is particularly price sensitive and price competitive and success in the generic business is dependent upon many factors  including fda approval  ability to launch at patent expiration of the brand name drug product and the number of generic competitors entering the market 
although we believe that our generic drug strategy  and particularly our alliances with india based pharmaceutical companies who are able to manufacture drugs at their fda approved plants  provides us an opportunity to compete in the generic drug markets we have identified  we have not yet sold any generic drugs  or had any approved  and can not provide any assurance that our entry into these markets will be successful or profitable 
any product for which we obtain fda approval must also compete for market acceptance and market share 
for example  cisplatin and carboplatin are the most prevalent platinum based derivatives used in chemotherapy and are the primary treatment for many of the cancer types we are pursuing 
our drug candidate  satraplatin  if the fda approves it for sale  would likely compete against these drugs directly 
unless satraplatin is shown to have better efficacy and is as cost effective  if not more cost effective  than cisplatin and carboplatin  it may not gain acceptance by the medical field and therefore never be successful commercially 
competition for branded drugs is less driven by price and is more focused on innovation in treatment of disease  advanced drug delivery and specific clinical benefits over competitive drug therapies 
we expect technological developments and improvements in the fields of our business to continue to occur at a rapid rate and  as a result  expect competition to remain intense 
please also read our discussion of competition matters in the risk factors section of this report 
sales and marketing in previous years we did not have any products or services to market  and therefore  had no marketing  sales  or distribution organization 
in anticipation of fda approval of our andas for our generic drugs  in we entered into an agreement with lannett company to market and distribute our first generic drug  ciprofloxacin  if and when our anda is approved by the fda 
we also intend to seek alliances with other third parties to assist us in the marketing and sale of our other drug candidates 
in addition  in we hired a vice president of marketing and sales and intend to hire additional sales and marketing personnel in the future  as needs dictate 
research and development from our inception through september  we devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts to early stage drug research and development 
commencing with the launch of our new business strategy in august  we eliminated early stage drug research and development and focused our research and development efforts on development of later stage drug product candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
research and development expenditures are expensed as we incur them and were approximately million in  million in  and million in governmental regulation the production and marketing of our oncology and generic drug products are subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation 
the federal food  drug and cosmetics act  as amended from time to time  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our proposed products 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework  including for drugs already at a clinical stage of development  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to regular inspections by the fda and must comply with good manufacturing practices 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign 
table of contents manufacturing establishments must also comply with good manufacturing practices and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in certain of such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
general information about the drug approval process the united states system of new drug approval is one of the most rigorous in the world 
only a small percentage of compounds that enter the pre clinical testing stage are ever approved for commercialization 
our oncology strategy focuses on in licensing clinical stage drug candidates that are already in or about to enter human clinical trials 
this strategic focus on clinical stage drug candidates those eligible for human trials is designed to address certain risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability and reducing the risk of failure  both of which are higher with an early stage product 
the following general comments about the drug approval process are relevant to the development activities we are undertaking with our oncology drugs 
pre clinical testing during the pre clinical testing stage  laboratory and animal studies are conducted to show biological activity of a drug compound against the targeted disease and the compound is evaluated for safety 
investigational new drug application after pre clinical testing  an investigation new drug application is submitted to the fda to begin human testing of the drug 
phase clinical trials after an investigational new drug application becomes effective  phase human clinical trials can begin 
these trials  involving small numbers of healthy volunteers or patients usually define a drug candidate s safety profile  including the safe dosage range 
phase clinical trials in phase clinical trials  controlled studies of volunteer human patients with the targeted disease are conducted to assess the drug s effectiveness 
these studies are designed primarily to determine the appropriate dose levels and to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug on humans  as well as to determine if there are any side effects on humans 
phase clinical trials this phase usually involves large numbers of patients with the targeted disease 
during the phase clinical trials  physicians monitor the patients to determine the drug candidate s efficacy and to observe and report any adverse reactions that may result from long term use of the drug on a large  more widespread  patient population 
during the phase clinical trials  the drug candidate is compared to either a placebo or a standard treatment for the target disease 
new drug application after completion of all three clinical trial phases  if the data indicates that the drug is safe and effective  a new drug application is filed with the fda 
we estimate that approval of a new drug application for a cancer drug generally takes six months to three years 
fast track review the fda has established procedures for accelerating the approval of drugs to be marketed for serious diseases for which the manufacturer can demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
one of our drug candidates  satraplatin  has been given a fast track designation for the hormone refractory prostate cancer indication 
abbreviated new drug application anda the abbreviated new drug application is particularly relevant for our generic drug strategy 
an anda is the abbreviated review and approval process created by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of for the accelerated approval of generic drugs 
an anda applicant must certify that the generic drug does not infringe on existing patent s  that the relevant patents have expired and no further patent protection is afforded to the innovator  or that the relevant patent s for the brand name product is invalid 
the anda must also demonstrate both chemical equivalence and bio equivalence the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug in the body is substantially equivalent to the previously approved brand name drug  unless a bio equivalence waiver is granted by the fda in the case of an injectable generic drug to the brand name product 
the anda drug development and approval process generally takes less time than the nda drug development and approval 
table of contents process since the anda process does not require new clinical trials establishing the safety and efficacy of the drug product 
we estimate that approval of an abbreviated new drug application generally takes one to two years 
approval if the fda approves the new drug application  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe to patients for treatment 
the marketing of a drug after fda approval is subject to substantial continuing regulation by the fda  including regulation of manufacturing practices and the advertising and promotion of the drug 
failure to comply with fda and other governmental regulations can result in fines  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas  andas or other product applications enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although we have internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
see risks factors any failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation could prevent or delay product approval or cause governmental authorities to disallow our products after approval and subject us to criminal or civil liabilities 
the generic drug enforcement act of established penalties for wrongdoing in connection with the development or submission of an anda 
under this act  the fda has the authority to permanently or temporarily bar companies or individuals from submitting or assisting in the submission of an anda  and to temporarily deny approval and suspend applications to market generic drugs 
the fda may also suspend the distribution of all drugs approved or developed in connection with certain wrongful conduct and or withdraw approval of an anda and seek civil penalties 
the fda can also significantly delay the approval of any pending nda  anda or other regulatory submissions under its fraud  untrue statements of material facts  bribery and illegal gratuities policy 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies  and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies 
the impact of this new requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
continuing studies of the proper utilization  safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals and other health care products are being conducted by industry  government agencies and others 
such studies  which increasingly employ sophisticated methods and techniques  can call into question the utilization  safety and efficacy of previously marketed products and in some cases have resulted  and may in the future result  in the discontinuance of their marketing 
employees as of december   we had sixteen full time employees  of which four hold md degrees and one holds a md degree 
we anticipate hiring additional personnel as needs dictate to implement our growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in sufficient numbers to meet our needs 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we regard our relations with our employees to be good

for financial information regarding our business activities  please see item financial statements 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this report  any one of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose a part or all of your investment 
you should consider these risks carefully before deciding to invest in our common stock 
factors that may affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and prospects include our losses will continue to increase as we expand our development efforts  and our efforts may never result in profitability 
our cumulative losses since our inception in through december  were in excess of million  almost all of which consisted of research and development and general and administrative expenses 
we lost approximately million in  million in and million in we expect to continue to incur losses in the future  particularly as we continue to invest in the development of our oncology drug candidates  and expand the scope of our generics operations 
we currently do not sell any products or services and we may never achieve revenues from sales of products or become profitable 
even if we eventually generate revenues from sales  we nevertheless may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years 
our business does not generate the cash needed to finance our ongoing operations and therefore  we will need to raise additional capital 
our business does not generate cash from operations needed to finance our ongoing operations 
we have relied primarily on raising capital through the sale of our securities  and or out licensing our drug candidates and technology  to meet our financial needs 
our existing cash and investment securities are sufficient to fund our current planned pharmaceutical operations for the next two years based upon our current operating expenses 
therefore  we expect that we may need to seek additional capital within the next two years  through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements to continue operating our businesses and to support the research and development of our potential products long term 
in addition  if we choose to expand our operations beyond what is currently planned  or should our anticipated operating expenses increase  we will have to raise capital sooner 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms  if at all 
accordingly  we may be forced to significantly change our business plans and restructure our operations to conserve cash  which would likely involve out licensing or selling some or all of our intellectual  technological and or tangible property not presently contemplated and at terms that we believe would not be favorable to us and or reducing the scope and nature of our currently planned research and drug development activities 
an inability to raise additional capital would also impact our ability to expand operations 

table of contents our existing oncology drug candidates may not prove safe or effective 
each of our existing three oncology drug candidates  satraplatin  eoquin and elsamitrucin  are in various stages of clinical trials 
the principal purpose of such trials is to research and  hopefully  verify the safety and efficacy of the drug candidates in treating a particular disease or symptom 
clinical trial data may indicate that any or all of our drug candidates either are not sufficiently safe for human use or do not have a meaningful beneficial effect in the treatment of a particular disease or symptom 
if we  or a regulatory body such as the fda  conclude that any of our drug candidates either are not safe or have no beneficial effect  then the value of that drug candidate will be materially diminished or lost entirely 
if and when we acquire additional oncology drug candidates  they also will be subject to these same risks and uncertainties 
our oncology drug candidates may not be more effective  safer or more cost efficient than competing drugs and otherwise may not have any competitive advantage 
oncology drugs produced by other companies are currently on the market for each cancer type we are pursuing 
even if one or more of our oncology drug candidates ultimately received fda approval  we cannot provide any assurance that our drug candidates will have better efficacy in treating the target indication than a competing drug  have a more favorable side effect profile than a competing drug  be more cost efficient to manufacture or apply  or otherwise demonstrate a competitive advantage over competing therapies 
accordingly  even if fda approval is obtained for one or more of our drug candidates  we can provide no assurance that it will gain acceptance by the medical field or become commercially successful 
the development of our lead drug candidate  satraplatin  depends on the efforts of a third party 
in september  we entered into a co development and license agreement with gpc biotech ag for the development and commercialization of our lead drug candidate  satraplatin 
gpc biotech has agreed to fully fund development and commercialization expenses for satraplatin 
we will not have control over the drug development process and therefore  the success of our lead drug candidate will depend upon the efforts of gpc biotech 
there is no assurance that gpc biotech will be successful in the clinical development of the drug  the achievement of any milestones such as the acceptance of a nda filing by the fda or the eventual commercialization of satraplatin 
our efforts to acquire or in license and develop additional oncology drug candidates may fail 
the long term success of our oncology strategy depends in part on obtaining clinical stage drug candidates in addition to our existing portfolio of satraplatin  eoquin and elsamitrucin 
we are actively seeking to acquire or in license additional clinical stage oncology drug candidates 
we can give no assurance  however  that we will be successful in locating and acquiring or in licensing additional desirable drug candidates on acceptable terms 
price and other competitive pressures may make the marketing and sale of our generic drugs not commercially feasible and not profitable 
we have not yet successfully obtained regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market one or more generic drug products in the united states  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to complete a transfer price arrangement with the manufacturer of the drug product that will allow us to market the drug s in the united states on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in addition  the generic drug market in the united states is extremely competitive  characterized by many participants and constant downward price pressure on generic drug products 
consequently  margins are continually reduced and it is necessary to continually introduce new products to achieve and maintain profitability 
if we obtain regulatory approval to market one or more generic drug products in the united states  then we may face opposition from the producers of the branded versions of these drugs 
branded pharmaceutical companies have aggressively sought to prevent generic competition  including the extensive use of litigation 

table of contents in addition  many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent  which could extend patent protection for a number of years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to the united states pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  and attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation 
in addition  some branded pharmaceutical companies have engaged in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs 
some of these initiatives could have an impact on products that we will seek to introduce into the united states 
we have limited resources  and may not be able to effectively respond to these or other measures that may be taken by pharmaceutical companies that produce the branded version of our generic products 
we may not be successful in establishing additional generic drug supply relationships 
long term success of our generic drug strategy depends in part on our ability to expand and enhance our existing relationships and establish new relationships for supplying generic drug products 
we do not presently intend to focus our research and development efforts on developing active pharmaceutical ingredients or the dosage form for generic drugs 
in addition  we currently have no capacity to manufacture generic drug products and do not intend to spend our capital resources to develop the capacity to do so 
therefore  we must rely on relationships with other companies to supply our generic drug products 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in expanding or enhancing our existing relationships or in securing new relationships 
if we fail to expand relationships  our ability to expand our generic drug business will be harmed 
we may not be successful in expanding our generic drug distribution capabilities in the united states 
many of our competitors have substantial  established direct and indirect distribution channels 
we have not yet undertaken the marketing and distribution of a generic drug product and we currently have no direct sales and marketing organization and our limited sales and marketing resources our devoted to establishing and enhancing our third party distribution relationships 
the long term success of our generic drug strategy depends in part on our ability to enlarge and enhance our generic drug distribution capability in the us we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in expanding or enhancing our existing distribution channel relationships  establishing new  additional distribution channel relationships or establishing a direct generic drug marketing capability sufficient to effectively and successfully compete 
once approved  our supply of a generic drug product is dependent upon the production capabilities of our supply sources 
we have no internal manufacturing capacity for our drug product candidates  and therefore  we will be dependent on our manufacturing partners for our supply of products 
the manufacture of certain generic drug products  including the acquisition of compounds used in the manufacture of the finished generic drug product  may require considerable lead times 
further  sales of a new generic drug product may be difficult to forecast 
also  we will have no control over the production process 
accordingly  there could arise circumstances in which market demand for a particular generic product could outstrip the ability of our supply source to timely manufacture and deliver the product  thereby causing us to lose sales 

table of contents we are dependent on third parties for clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing our proposed products 
we may not conduct some clinical trials ourselves  and we will not manufacture any of our proposed products for commercial sale nor do we have the resources necessary to do so 
in addition  we do not have the capability to market our drug products ourselves 
we intend to contract with larger pharmaceutical companies or contract research organizations to conduct such activities 
in connection with our efforts to secure corporate partners  we may seek to retain certain co marketing rights to certain of our drug candidates  so that we may promote our products to selected medical specialists while our corporate partner promotes these products to the medical market generally 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to enter into any partnering arrangements on this or any other basis 
if we are not able to secure adequate partnering arrangements  we will have to hire additional employees or consultants with expertise in marketing  since our current employees have no experience in these areas 
we cannot be certain that sufficient employees with relevant skills will be available to us 
any increase in the number of our employees would increase our expense level  and could have an adverse effect on our financial position 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we or our potential corporate partners can successfully introduce our proposed products or that such proposed products will achieve acceptance by patients  health care providers and insurance companies 
further  it is possible that we may not be able to secure arrangements to manufacture and market our proposed products at prices that would permit us to make a profit 
to the extent that clinical trials are conducted by corporate partners  we may not be able to control the design and conduct of these clinical trials 
our limited experience at managing and conducting clinical trials ourselves may delay the trials and increase our costs 
we may manage and conduct some future clinical trials ourselves rather than hiring outside clinical trial contractors 
while some of our management has had experience at conducting clinical trials  we have limited experience in doing so as a company 
if we move forward with self conducted clinical trials  our limited experience may delay the completion of our clinical trials and increase our costs 
rapid technological advancement may render our drug candidates obsolete 
the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology 
we cannot provide any assurance that a competitor may not develop a new technology  product or therapy that has better efficacy  a more favorable side effect profile or is more cost effective than one or more of our drug candidates or generic products and thereby cause our drug candidate or generic product to become commercially obsolete 
competition for patients in conducting clinical trials may prevent or delay approval of a drug candidate and strain our limited financial resources 
many pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials in patients with the cancer types that our drug candidates target 
as a result  we must compete with them for clinical sites  physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials 
also  due to the confidential nature of clinical trials  we cannot be certain how many of the eligible cancer patients may be enrolled in competing studies and consequently not available to us 
this competition may increase costs of our clinical trials and delay the introduction of our potential products 
we are a small company relative to our principal competitors and our limited financial resources may limit our ability to develop and market our oncology drug candidates and our generic strategy drug products 
many companies  both public and private  including well known pharmaceutical companies and smaller niche focused companies  are developing products to treat all of the diseases we are pursuing  or distribute generic drug products directly competitive to the generic drugs we intend to market and distribute 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing 
table of contents and sales experience and resources than us 
as a result  our competitors may be more successful than us in developing their products  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing their products to consumers 
we may need additional expertise in marketing and other areas in order to achieve our business objectives and we may not be able to attract additional skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel among pharmaceutical companies is intense  and the loss of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional skilled personnel required for the expansion of our business  could significantly damage our business 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market and sell any of our oncology or generic drugs 
before our drug candidates can be marketed and sold in the united states  regulatory approval must be obtained from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies 
following successful completion of phase clinical trials  a comprehensive new drug application nda must be filed with the fda 
the review and approval  or denial  process for an application can take years 
we can give no assurance that the fda  and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  will timely  or ever  approve an application 
among the many possibilities  the fda may require substantial additional testing or clinical trials or find our drug candidate is not sufficiently safe or effective in treating the targeted disease 
further  we cannot provide any assurance that a competitor may not develop a competing drug or therapy that impairs or eliminates the commercial feasibility of our drug candidates 
we plan to use our management s experience with the regulatory approval process in the united states to prepare  file and prosecute appropriate abbreviated new drug applications andas for our current and future generic drug candidates 
during we filed three andas for ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 
we intend to file additional andas during and beyond 
we cannot provide any assurance that the fda will approve all  or any  of our andas 
generic drugs generally have a relatively short window in which they can be profitable before other manufacturers introduce competing products that impose downward pressure on prices and reduce market share for other versions of the generic drug 
consequently  delays in obtaining fda approval may also significantly impair our ability to compete 
any failure to comply with extensive governmental regulation could prevent or delay product approval or cause governmental authorities to disallow our products after approval and subject us to criminal or civil liabilities 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose many requirements on the introduction of new drugs through lengthy and detailed clinical testing and data collection procedures  and other costly and time consuming compliance procedures 
these requirements apply to every stage of the clinical trial process and make it difficult to estimate when any of our drug candidates will be available commercially  if at all 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable fda regulations  if we fail to comply with the regulations applicable to our clinical testing  the fda may delay  suspend or cancel our clinical trials  or the fda might not accept the test results 
the fda  or any comparable regulatory agency in another country  may suspend clinical trials at any time if it concludes that the trials expose subjects participating in such trials to unacceptable health risks 
further  human clinical testing may not show any current or future product candidate to be safe and effective to the satisfaction of the fda or comparable regulatory agencies or the data derived from the clinical tests may be unsuitable for submission to the fda or other regulatory agencies 
once we submit a drug candidate for commercial sale approval  the fda or other regulatory agencies may not issue their approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
if we are delayed or fail to obtain these approvals  our business and prospects may be significantly damaged 
if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  either 
table of contents prior to seeking approval or in marketing our products after approval  we could be subject to regulatory or judicial enforcement actions 
these actions could result in product recalls or seizures  injunctions  civil penalties  criminal prosecution  refusals to approve new products and withdrawal of existing approvals  and enhanced exposure to product liabilities 
intellectual property rights are complex and uncertain and therefore may subject us to infringement claims 
the patent positions related to our drug portfolio candidates that we have in licensed from third parties and those related to our generic strategy drug candidate portfolio are inherently uncertain and involve complex legal and factual issues 
although we are not aware of any infringement by any of our drug candidates on the rights of any third party  there may be third party patents or other intellectual property rights relevant to our drug candidates of which we are not aware 
third parties may assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to our drug candidates or our generic drug products 
this could draw us into costly litigation as well as result in the loss of our use of the intellectual property that is critical to our business strategy 
intellectual property litigation is increasingly common and increasingly expensive 
patent and other intellectual property litigation is becoming more common in the pharmaceutical industry 
litigation is sometimes necessary to defend against or assert claims of infringement  to enforce our patent rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of proprietary rights of third parties 
no third party has asserted that we are infringing upon their patent rights or other intellectual property  nor are we aware that we are infringing upon any third party s patent rights or other intellectual property 
we may  however  be infringing upon a third party s patent rights or other intellectual property  and litigation asserting such claims might be initiated in which we would not prevail or we would not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on reasonable terms  if at all 
all such litigation  whether meritorious or not  as well as litigation initiated by us against third parties  is time consuming and very expensive to defend or prosecute and to resolve 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology we also claim  we may have to participate in interference proceedings required by the patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial costs  even if we ultimately prevail 
results of interference proceedings are highly unpredictable and may result in us having to try to obtain licenses in order to continue to develop or market certain of our drug candidates 
we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual protections for our un patented  confidential and proprietary technology 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we enter into proprietary information agreements with our employees  consultants and others  these agreements may not successfully protect our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information 
we may be subject to product liability claims  and may not have sufficient product liability insurance to cover any such claims  which may expose us to substantial liabilities 
we may be exposed to product liability claims from patients who participate in our clinical trials  or  if we are able to obtain fda approval for one or more of our potential products  from consumers of our products 
although we currently carry product liability insurance in the amount of million per occurrence and in the aggregate  it is possible that the amounts of this coverage will be insufficient to protect us from future claims 

table of contents further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance or obtain or maintain additional insurance on acceptable terms for our clinical and commercial activities or that such additional insurance would be sufficient to cover any potential product liability claim or recall 
failure to maintain sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects and results of operations if claims are made that exceed our coverage 
the loss of key personnel could significantly hinder our growth strategy and might cause our business to fail 
our success depends upon the contributions of our key management and scientific personnel  especially dr 
rajesh c 
shrotriya  our chairman  president and chief executive officer and dr 
luigi lenaz  the president of our oncology division 
dr 
shrotriya has been president since and chief executive officer since  and has spearheaded the major changes in our business strategy and coordinated structural reorganization 
dr 
lenaz has been president of our oncology division since and has played a key role in the identification and development of our oncology drug candidates 
the loss of the services of dr 
shrotriya  dr 
lenaz or any other key personnel could delay or preclude us from achieving our business objectives 
dr 
shrotriya has an employment agreement with us that will expire on december   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless we  or dr 
shrotriya  gives notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 
dr 
lenaz has an employment agreement with us that will expire on july   with automatic one year renewals thereafter unless dr 
lenaz or we give notice of intent not to renew at least days in advance of the renewal date 
we also may need substantial additional expertise in marketing and other areas in order to achieve our business objectives 
competition for qualified personnel among pharmaceutical companies is intense  and the loss of key personnel  or the delay or inability to attract and retain the additional skilled personnel required for the expansion of our business  could significantly damage our business 
there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market 
the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
any future equity issuances by us may have dilutive and other effects on our existing stockholders 
as of march   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding  and in addition  security holders held options  warrants and preferred stock which  if exercised or converted  would obligate us to issue up to approximately million additional shares of common stock 
a substantial number of those shares  when we issue them upon conversion or exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
the market price of our common stock could fall as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
we have financed our operations  and for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to finance a substantial portion of our operating cash requirements  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and may have a dilutive impact on our other stockholders 
these issuances would also cause our net income  if any  to decrease or our loss per share to decrease in future periods 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could drop 
the market price and volume of our common stock fluctuate significantly and could result in substantial losses for individual investors 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock is highly volatile 
factors that may cause the market price and volume of our common stock to decrease include fluctuations in our results of operations  timing and announcements of our technological innovations or new products or those of our competitors  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments with respect to patents and proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of products 
table of contents developed by us or others  changes in health care policy in the united states and in foreign countries  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  the pharmaceutical industry generally and general market conditions 
in addition  the market price and volume of our common stock may decrease if our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
while a decrease in market price could result in direct economic loss for an individual investor  low trading volume could limit an individual investor s ability to sell our common stock  which could result in substantial economic loss as well 
during  the price of our common stock ranged between and  and the daily trading volume  was as high as  shares and as low as  shares 
certain charter and bylaws provisions and our stockholder rights plan may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace current management 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  as amended  and bylaws may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or replace our current management 
these provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could delay  discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business or replacing our current management  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which we distributed rights to purchase units of our series b junior participating preferred stock 
the rights become exercisable upon the earlier of ten days after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has acquired or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock or ten business days after a tender offer has commenced that would result in a person or group beneficially owning or more of our outstanding common stock 
these rights could delay or discourage someone from acquiring our business  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
the use of hazardous materials in our research and development efforts imposes certain compliance costs on us and may subject us to liability for claims arising from the use or misuse of these materials 
our research and development efforts involved and may involve the use of hazardous materials  including biological materials  chemicals and radioactive materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the storage  use and disposal of these materials and some waste products 
we believe that our safety procedures for the storage  use and disposal of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local regulations 
however  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if there were to be an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  which could exceed our financial resources 
we currently maintain insurance coverage of up to  per occurrence for injuries resulting from the hazardous materials we use  and up to  per occurrence for pollution clean up and removal  however  future claims may exceed these amounts 
currently the costs of complying with federal  state and local regulations are not significant  and consist primarily of waste disposal expenses 
item properties our corporate administrative offices are located in a two story  square foot facility containing office and laboratory space  constructed for us in irvine  california 
the base monthly rent for the facility is currently  plus taxes  insurance and common area maintenance 
the lease on this facility expires on june  at which time we anticipate renewing the lease for a five year period  at a cost equal to or better than our current lease rate 
this facility is suitable and adequate to undertake our current and anticipated future operations  however  at this time  we are currently utilizing only half of the facility 
for the foreseeable future we expect to continue sub leasing the laboratory space to one or more third parties we lease a small administrative office in zurich  switzerland on an expense sharing basis 
the financial and other terms of this lease are not material to our business 

table of contents as of december   we were also committed through september under a non cancelable lease entered into in with the regents of the university of california  irvine uci  in order to conduct our functional genomics research at a laboratory administrative facility adjacent to the university 
in march  we reached a settlement  subject to completion of definitive documentation  with uci  pursuant to which the future lease obligations have been terminated

financial condition general since inception in through august  we devoted our resources primarily to fund research on early stage  or novel  drug products and functional genomics discovery  and recorded significant losses 
our operations have historically been financed by the issuance of capital stock because it is generally difficult to 
table of contents fund pharmaceutical research via borrowings due to the significant expenses involved  lack of revenues sufficient to service debt and the significant inherent uncertainty as to results of this research and the timing of those results 
in august  we adopted a new business model  with a primary focus on conducting development research on late stage oncology products 
this strategy is designed to address the risks of drug development by shortening the timeline to marketability  and reducing the risk of failure  which is higher with an early stage product 
further  in order to mitigate our future financing needs to fund such research  our plan is to generate revenues from the sale of generic versions of drugs coming off patent over the next several years 
if successful  we believe this strategy may provide revenues as early as our cumulative losses through december  have exceeded million 
our operating expenses  excluding stock based compensation and restructuring expenses  were reduced from approximately million per quarter during the first half of to an average of less than million per quarter during such reduction in expenses was principally due to reductions in personnel  occupancy  drug product and formulation costs  associated with the discontinued neurology and functional genomics activities 
our anticipated average operating expenses excluding stock based compensation and restructuring charges  if any for is expected to increase to approximately million per quarter  reflecting the increase in our scope of activities  which include development of our oncology drug candidates and investigation and development of new generic drug candidates 
we expect to continue to incur additional losses as we implement our growth strategy of developing marketable drug products 
such significant additional operating losses are likely to be incurred for at least the next several years unless they are offset  if at all  by licensing revenues under our agreement with gpc biotech ag and any revenue from our generic products 
liquidity and capital resources since august we have secured over million in financing  entered into strategic alliances  and filed three andas with the fda 
these actions are designed to position us to capitalize on growth opportunities 
our business does not generate enough cash from operations needed to finance our ongoing operations 
however  we believe that the approximately million in cash and marketable securities on hand as of december  will be sufficient to fund our current planned operations for approximately two years  based on our current operating expenses excluding stock based compensation and restructuring charges  if any 
in addition  as of december   security holders held options and warrants which  if exercised  would obligate us to issue up to approximately an additional million shares of common stock for potential aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
over the long term  we will likely need to continue to raise funds through public or private financings  including equity financings and through other arrangements  to continue operating our business 
however  if we are successful in generating revenues and profits from the sale of generic drugs  we expect to use such resources to help to reduce this reliance on raising funds through the sale of our securities 
net cash used in operating activities during the years ended december  and  the net cash used in operations  for research and development and general and administrative expenses  was approximately million and million respectively  after recording revenues of million and million respectively 
the decrease in cash used in operations in was primarily due to reduced spending for activities related to functional genomics and neurology that were not consistent with our new business focus 
net cash provided by and used for financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from financing sources of million from the 
table of contents prior year was primarily due to the issuance in of shares of our series d preferred stock for approximately million   shares of our common stock for approximately million  shares of our series e preferred stock for approximately million and  shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants for approximately million 
we have no debt except capital lease obligations  capital lease payments amounted to  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
critical accounting polices and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including cash requirements  from assessing planned research and development activities and general and administrative requirements  the retention of key personnel  required clinical trial activity  market need for our drug candidates and other major business assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of our judgment 
we consider the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
property and equipment we carry property and equipment at historical cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated lives generally to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or lease term 
we review long lived assets  including property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  we reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
patents and licenses we own or license all the intellectual property that forms the basis of our intellectual property 
to date we have adopted the practice of expensing all licensing and patent application costs 
revenue recognition license fees comprise initial fees and milestone payments derived from collaborative licensing arrangements 
we defer revenue recognition for milestone events which are reasonably assured and recognize them ratably over the minimum remaining period of our performance obligations 
milestones which are not reasonably assured are treated as the culmination of a separate earnings process and are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved 
research and development research and development expenses are comprised of the following types of costs incurred in performing research and development activities personnel expenses  facility costs  contract services  costs of clinical trials  laboratory supplies and drugs  and allocations of corporate costs 
we expense all research and development activity costs in the period incurred 

table of contents accounting for stock based employee compensation we account for all of our stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  we recognize non employee stock based compensation or payments using a fair market value methodology promulgated by sfas  which standard also permits continued use of accounting for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value methodology of accounting promulgated by accounting principles board or apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the intrinsic value method  stock based compensation is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the measurement date over the exercise price 
we recognize employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value methodology promulgated by apb results of operations results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for of million decreased by approximately million as compared to  and was derived from the second licensing fee of million under the co development and licensing agreement with gpc biotech ag  which became due in september upon dosing of the first patient in a registrationial study 
future gpc revenues are dependant upon the occurrence of milestones specified in the agreement 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  from million in to million in primarily as a result of the restructuring  initiated in august  whereby all research activities related to neotrofin  functional genomics and neurology were eliminated 
in  research and development expenses included our ongoing clinical trial for eoquin in the treatment of patients with superficial bladder cancer  procurement of elsamitrucin supplies for an upcoming clinical trial in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma and expenses incurred in connection with the filing of our andas for ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 
as a result of the increasing scope of our activities  which include development of our oncology drug candidates and investigation and development of new generic drug candidates  we expect increases in research and development expenses in and beyond 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  from million in to million in due primarily to the following factors legal and professional fees increased by approximately  in due to the changes in our organization  expenses incurred in successfully addressing the nasdaq delisting notice we received in march  additional expenses for compliance with california and other state securities laws due to our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  compliance with new sec and sarbanes oxley act rules and regulations  and evaluation of business alliances and opportunities in conjunction with our generic drug strategy  employee severance costs included in general and administrative in of approximately  as a result of the change in our business plan  and a dramatic reduction in the scope of our research and development activities  the allocation of general and administrative costs to research and development was million lower in as compared to  and offsetting the foregoing increases was an aggregate decrease of approximately million in payroll and occupancy costs  depreciation and other miscellaneous corporate overhead 
stock based compensation expense of  for represents non cash charges as a result of stock awards and stock options granted to employees and consultants 
the use of options as a means to compensate and retain employees is crucial for a company like ours 
the increase of approximately million in stock based compensation from million in as compared to million in was primarily due to timing delays in in awarding stock options as a result of compliance with state securities laws during a period where our stock price was rising rapidly 

table of contents stock awards and options granted to employees are accounted for under apb all of the options granted by us have been made at fair market values on the dates originally authorized by the board of directors or our compensation committee 
however  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  certain grants to employees contemplated by the board had later effective grant dates 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash stock based employee compensation expense of  during in accordance with sfas  we expense the fair value of options granted to consultants 
during  we agreed to issue  to a consultant engaged to generate retail interest in our stock  a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the black scholes value of the warrant   is being amortized over the service period and  was charged to expense in during  approximately million of stock based compensation was charged in connection with the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in settlement of accounts payable to certain vendors 
in addition  during  we recorded compensation expense of  as a result of the amortization of deferred compensation costs which were recorded in and prior years  when we granted stock options to employees with exercise prices less than the fair value of our common stock at the measurement date 
the intrinsic values of the option grants were recorded as deferred compensation and were amortized to expense over the vesting period  in accordance with apb the restructuring charge of  in is related to an adjustment of the realizable value of assets held for sale as of december  other income for compared to increased approximately  due primarily to the elimination of miscellaneous expenses associated with the activities related to functional genomics and neurology 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal revenue for of  resulted from the recognition of the first licensing fee of million from the co development and licensing agreement with gpc biotech ag  and  from technology out licensing agreements with pfizer inc the pfizer license fees were recognized in upon the termination of all research activities at neogene  our functional genomics subsidiary  and the completion of all further commitments under those license agreements 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million from million in to million in primarily due to the conclusion of clinical trials for neotrofin  a previous neurology drug candidate  causing decreases in outside clinical research site costs  product manufacturing costs  and payroll costs of research personnel 
in addition  as a result of a restructuring initiated in august  all research activities related to neotrofin  functional genomics and neurology were eliminated 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million from million in to million in due to the decline in our scope of activity 
the principal components of the decrease were reductions in costs for administrative personnel  consulting  travel and lodging expenses  and officer relocation expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in corporate business expenses related to the development of our oncology related drug candidates 
stock based compensation expense decreased by approximately million from million in to million in as a result of the work force reductions in and the cancellation of stock options granted below fair market value in earlier years  the amortization of deferred compensation decreased by approximately million to approximately million 
offsetting such decrease was a million increase to approximately million in the issuance of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in settlement of accounts payable to certain vendors 
the restructuring charge of  recorded in related to the termination of all research efforts related to neurology and functional genomics research and development  and consisted of a fixed asset impairment charge of  resulting from the review of the carrying value of our laboratory equipment  
table of contents severance costs of  related to termination agreements with two senior executives  and research and administration employees  a  loss on exchange of certain assets in connection with the settlement of certain payment obligations to the university of california  irvine  in connection with the former functional genomics operations  and other restructuring related administrative and legal expenses of other income for compared to decreased by  due primarily to a  decrease in interest income resulting from lower average marketable securities balances and lower interest rates 
related party transactions director and officer notes for the exercise of equity instruments as of january   certain of our directors and officers owed us  previously loaned to them for the exercise of stock options or the purchase of stock 
during  we were repaid  which included all loans to officers 
in february  we agreed to forgive and terminate the remaining  and in return  the directors agreed to return the shares of common stock originally purchased under the loans 
for accounting purposes  this arrangement was considered to be an uncompleted transaction and therefore  the common stock and related notes receivable were eliminated as of december  outsource arrangement between november and november  we had outsourced the administration  accounting and human resources functions  and sec report preparation to mcmanus financial consulting mfc for a monthly fee of  and all investor relations activities to mcmanus co 
m c for a monthly fee of  between january and june  mfc also provided services to us at hourly rates  subject to a minimum annual retainer of  during the years ended december  and  mfc and m c received total fees and payments under severance arrangements amounting to  and  respectively 
mfc and m c are co owned by two of our former officers  john and michael mcmanus  who are also brothers 
john mcmanus received direct compensation from us as vice president finance and strategic planning and assistant corporate secretary  however  michael mcmanus received no direct compensation from us for his services as controller 
in november  john and michael mcmanus resigned their positions with the company to return to their consulting business to pursue other opportunities 
the consulting agreement with m c will remain in effect through its expiration on july  off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or obligations including contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents contractual and commercial obligations the following table summarizes our contractual and other commitments  including obligations under facilities leases and operating equipment leases  as of december  payment due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total excluded from the above table of minimum lease requirements  as of december   was  of minimum lease obligation related to of a facility leased in by our subsidiary  neogene  from the university of california  irvine uci lease 
under the terms of the uci lease  we were potentially liable for approximately double such amount  if uci is unable to use the remaining of the facility 
since inception of the uci lease  we have been charged approximately of the facility cost 
in march  we reached a settlement  subject to completion of definitive documentation  with uci  pursuant to which the future lease obligations have been terminated 
the full amount of the settlement has been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
licensing agreements we have acquired licenses to further develop certain therapeutic compounds  and are contingently liable for certain milestone payments to the licensor if we reach certain development milestones 
we have not reached any milestones and cannot determine when or if ever a milestone will be reached 
if we reach a milestone  it will likely occur prior to revenues being generated from the related compound 
employment agreements we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key executive personnel 
the agreements provide for  among other things  potential severance payments equal to up to twice the officer s annual base salary upon the termination of employment without cause or upon a change in control under certain circumstances 
business outlook you should read the following discussion of our business outlook together with the financial statements and the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
our primary business focus in and beyond will be to develop marketable drug products  focused on the development of oncology drugs and supplemented by marketable generic drugs 
our current product candidates are satraplatin  elsamitrucin  eoquin  ciprofloxacin  carboplatin and fluconazole 
we are currently developing our oncology drug candidates for the treatment of prostate cancer  bladder cancer  non hodgkin s lymphoma  and radiation sensitization as it relates to radiation treatment for cancer 
currently  each of our oncology drug candidates relates to life threatening diseases and we believe each is novel in its treatment or indication  therefore  we hope for expedited regulatory approval  whenever appropriate 
we believe that all of our proposed drug candidates  if approved by the fda  with sufficient funding  will eventually be marketed by us or with the assistance and leadership of a co development partner 
funding for satraplatin clinical trials is being borne entirely by our co development partner gpc biotech 

table of contents we are funding the phase clinical trials of eoquin and elsamitrucin 
in addition to the three generic drug andas filed in  we plan to file several new andas in and beyond 
in this regard we are evaluating several drug candidates for feasibility 
the evaluation of feasibility includes many factors  including  but not limited to  evaluation of market potential  competitive scenario  assessment of patent extensions  and availability of active pharmaceutical ingredients  etc 
we believe that our present cash resources are sufficient to support these clinical trials and the filing of the planned andas over approximately the next two years  based on our current operating expenses excluding stock based compensation and restructuring charges  if any 
in addition  we also have several neurology drug compounds that we intend to out license for further development because we are not pursuing internally  and do not presently intend to pursue internally  further development of these drug compounds which include ait for dementia  sppi for attention deficit disorders  sppi for psychosis  schizophrenia and other mood disorders and neotrofin for neurodegenerative diseases 
we expect to begin marketing ciprofloxacin  our first generic drug  through our partner in  if approved by the fda 
we view the potential for generic drug marketing and sales in the united states with the assistance of low cost  high quality manufacturers as a revenue opportunity which we believe will provide us with a source of funding for our research activities  thereby reducing our need to rely exclusively on the capital markets to fund our development activities 
while we intend to continue to expand the number of our drug candidates and targeted indications  we may need to access the capital markets if we are to expand our scope beyond the plans described above 
the availability of financing at reasonable terms is dependent upon many factors  including  but not limited to the performance of the stock price of our common stock 
therefore  our attempts to raise additional capital may be unsuccessful 
if we are able to secure sufficient new funds and are able to develop strategic alliances with other pharmaceutical businesses for co development opportunities  we expect that our operating expenses would increase over the next several years as we expand our research and development and commercialization activities and operations 
we expect to incur significant additional operating losses for at least the next several years 
we also expect that research and development expenses will increase as we expand our clinical trials on all of our drug candidates 
depending on the results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our drug candidates and the outcome of the regulatory approval process  we will expand our marketing and third party manufacturing capabilities as we approach the commercialization of each of our product candidates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and credit risk on our marketable securities and short term investments  which investments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we do not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
our primary exposures relate to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio  and credit risk of the companies bonds in which we invest 
we manage interest rate risk on our investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with our cash requirements 
our investments as of december  are fixed rate  short term corporate and government notes and bonds  which are available for sale 
because the interest rates are fixed  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of these investments but do not affect the interest earnings 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   any decline in the fair value of our investments would not be material 
in addition  we are exposed to certain market risks associated with corporations credit ratings of which we have purchased corporate bonds or paper 
if these companies were to experience a significant detrimental 
table of contents change in their credit ratings  the fair market value of such corporate bonds may significantly decrease 
if these companies were to default on such corporate bonds  we may lose part or all of our principal 
we believe that we effectively manage this market risk by diversifying our corporate bond investments by purchasing a few bonds of many large  well known  companies in a variety of industries
