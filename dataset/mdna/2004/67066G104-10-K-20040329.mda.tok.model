in connection with the redemption of the notes  we recorded a one time charge of approximately million  which included a million redemption premium and million of unamortized issuance costs 
sec investigation on september   we announced that the securities and exchange commission  or sec  had concluded its investigation of us and that we have reached a final agreement with the sec resolving an investigation undertaken by the sec s staff 
under the terms of the agreement  nvidia  without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing  agreed to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations of certain non fraud financial reporting  books and records  and internal control provisions 
there is no requirement to pay any fines or penalties 
acquisition of mediaq  inc on august   we completed the acquisition of mediaq  inc  or mediaq  a leading provider of graphics and multimedia technology for wireless mobile devices  for an aggregate purchase price that consisted of cash consideration of approximately million  including million of direct acquisition costs 
with the integration of mediaq  w e see an opportunity to leverage nvidia s resources and expertise in digital media processing to offer innovative products and thereby increase our revenues by entering into the multimedia handset market 
microsoft xbox on august   microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services 
the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain  but we do not believe that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least months 
revenue from microsoft during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
future objectives and challenges peripheral component interconnect express  or pci express pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking 
the transition to pci express  which is extremely complex  is central to our gpu and mcp objectives this year 
we intend to lead this transition using a pci express high speed interconnect  or hsi 
hsi is a complex piece of networking technology that performs high speed bi directional interconnect protocol conversion 
using hsi  we expect to transform some of our gpus into pci express compatible gpus 
with our pci express compatible gpus  we expect that our partners will be able to launch pci express compatible solutions in april during fiscal  we expect to launch and be in full production with a top to bottom product line of next generation pci express gpus based on our brand new nvx architecture 
gross margin improvement we remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins 
with the scale of our business  we believe driving gross margins to our historical levels can result in earnings improvements 
nforce just as nforce was the driver for our platform processor business growth in fiscal  nforce has the potential to achieve similar results for fiscal our mcp objective is to innovate in all areas of features  performance and compatibility 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we intend to launch our next nforce  which is expected to be the first single chip mcp to offer gigabit ethernet  dual independent serial advanced technology attachment  or ata  controllers  industry leading redundant array of independent disks  or raid  features and hardware security processing 
handsets our handheld objective is to drive the multimedia handheld era by building exciting products that leverage nvidia s expertise  resources  and investments in digital media processing 
the first quarter of fiscal will mark the beginning of a series of introductions of exciting new ultra low power media processors for handsets 
over the next several years  digital media processing technologies are expected to play a critical role in the cell phone industry 
cell phones that take digital pictures will eclipse shipments of digital cameras 
with the umps on our roadmap  future cell phones will be able to receive television programs  record digital video like a camcorder  enable video phone calls  and be your portable game player 

micron process on february   we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select up coming gpus at tsmc s um micron process technology 
we will combine tsmc s micron process with our own engineering designs  to deliver high performance and low power consumption in a graphics processor 
tsmc s micron process technology is fundamentally a photolithographic shrink of its industry leading micron process 
though actual results are design dependent  tsmc s micron high performance process also includes transistor enhancements that improve speed and reduce power consumption relative to its micron technology 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets 
we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  as such  we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
unclaimed rebates  which hist orically have not been significant  are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs  which we also account for in accordance with eitf mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  oems  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products 
if market conditions decline  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure 
our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 
our current credit insurance agreement expires on december  as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented of our gross accounts receivable balance 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at of our gross accounts receivable balance  then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january  would have been approximately million  rather than the actual b alance of million 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
no significant sales of such products have occurred to date 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we utilize a two step approach to testing long lived assets for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment indicators 
if an impairment indicator is present  the second step measures whether the asset is recoverable based on a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our review requires the use of judgment and estimates 
no such impairment charges have occurred to date 
however  future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings if we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable 
goodwill we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that there was no impairment 
however  future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation all owance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states  or us  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million 
of the total valuation allowance  million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  if and when realization is sustained  will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity 
of the remaining valuation allowance at january   million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not more likely than not to be realized due  in part  to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes  and million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not more likely than not to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable  recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero  then reduce other non current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable  we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended january  january  january  revenue cost of revenue cost of revenue related to stock option exchange gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative in process research and development stock option exchange amortization of goodwill acquisition related charges discontinued use of property total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net convertible debenture redemption expense income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal years ended january   january   and january  revenue revenue was billion in fiscal  billion in fiscal  and billion in fiscal  which represented a decrease of from fiscal to and an increase of from fiscal to the revenue decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of a significant decrease in sales of xbox processors to microsoft  offset by growth in our gpu  mcp and ump products 
the revenue growth from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of significant sales of xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our gpu and mcp products 
revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for  and of total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 
the increase in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to decreased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product  which are billed to microsoft in the united states 
the decrease in the percentage of revenue from sal es to customers outside of the united states for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased sales of xgpus and mcps used in the microsoft xbox product 
sales to microsoft accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal our other three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal in fiscal  sales to microsoft accounted for approximately of revenues 
our other three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal in fiscal  sales to microsoft accounted for approximately of revenues 
our other three largest customers accounted for approximately of revenues for fiscal in future periods  our revenue may be affected by demand for and market acceptance of our products and or our customers products  our ability to successfully develop and produce our products in volume production  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
gross profit gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory provisions and shipping costs 
gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold 
our gross margin was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased primarily due to a shift in the mix of product sales to our new generation of geforce fx products 
our geforce fx products generally have experienced lower gross margins than previous geforce products 
this decrease was offset by an increase in gross margins on sales of xbox processors in fiscal when compared to fiscal  which resulted from the pricing settlement with microsoft that we announced on february  gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased primarily due to a shift in mix of product sales that included more sales of xbox processors which  at that time  generally had lower margins than our other pro ducts 
in addition  the decrease was due to an inventory write down of approximately million related to certain xbox processors and nforce platform processors during the second quarter of fiscal  and the stock option exchange expense of million that was charged to cost of revenue related to manufacturing personnel during the third quarter of fiscal in the future  we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand and market acceptance of our products and or our customers products could also negatively impact our gross margins 
we do not expect past results to be indicative of future periods 
we remain intensely focused on driving down cost and improving gross margins 
we expect improvement in our gross margins and believe our gross margins can be or more 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  cost of development tools and software  cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  including approximately employees that we obtained as a result of our acquisition of mediaq  a million increase associated with lab equipment  software licenses  maintenance fees and increased depreciation and amortization charges  and a million increase in facility expenses  offset by a million decrease in new product development costs and other expenses during the period 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  a million increase associated with lab equipment  software licenses  maintenance fees and depreciation charges  a million increase related to engineering costs to develop next generation products  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses  travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  a million increase in tradeshow  marketing development and general administrative activities and a million increase in computer software and equipment related to the enhancement of our computer systems and the depreciation and amortization of new equ ipment 
these increases were offset by an million decrease in legal fees related to higher legal fees incurred during fiscal for various issues that have since been resolved  including the sec inquiry  microsoft arbitration and shareholder lawsuits 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel and commissions  a million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings  a million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems  a million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses

in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of mediaq in august  we wrote off million of in process research and development expense  or ipr d  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin  applic ability of sfas no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of sfas no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria must be charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
stock option exchange 
on september   we commenced an offer  or the offer  to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share  or eligible options 
stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the offer  representing approximately of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date 
only employees of nvidia or one of our subsidiaries as of september  who continued to be employees through the offer termination date of october  were eligible to participate in the offer 
employees who were on medical  maternit y  worker s compensation  military or other statutorily protected leave of absence  or a personal leave of absence  were also eligible to participate in the offer 
employees who were terminated on or before the offer termination date of october   were not eligible to participate in the offer 
in addition  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in this offer 
on october   the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately  eligible options for total consideration of million  consisting of million in fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our common stock approximately  shares and million in employer and employee related taxes 
the number of fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of our common stock on october   of per share 
amortization of goodwill 
during fiscal  amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from dfx 
the initial allocation of the purchase price included million of goodwill  plus approximately million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place  which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal we have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and concluded that there was no impairment 
acquisition related charges 
acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from dfx in fiscal these charges primarily consisted of bonuses to former dfx employees 
discontinued use of property 
discontinued use of property consists of write offs of million relating to our previous office space in santa clara  california 
since we relocated in june  we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
the write offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease  including rental payments  capitalized leasehold improvements  and furniture and fixtures 
in december  we filed a complaint against extreme networks inc  the sublessor of the property  seeking payment of lease payments and other property charges for the period of july through december and seeking a declaration that we are not liable for any future payments under the lease 
in july   we settled the matter with extreme networks and in august   the complaint was dismissed with prejudice 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income decreased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal when compared to fiscal this was caused by the redemption of our million convertible subordinated debentures in october interest income decreased from million to million from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the decline in market interest rates

please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the components of income tax expense 
the increase in our annual effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to our not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal as our loss before income tax expense for that quarter was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available 
we expect our annual effective income tax rate to be for fiscal please refer to part ii  item critical accounting policies income taxes for items that may affect this estimate 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the million redemption of the notes in october and the million acquisition of mediaq in august our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions 
our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities  the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration 
operating activities generated cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in inventory and decrease in income taxes payable due to the settlement of certain tax contingencies 
cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities  the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment  which include leasehold improvements for our facilities 
investing activities provided cash of million and used cash of million during fiscal and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to million of net sales and maturities of marketable securities as we liquidated a significant portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to obtain the cash required to redeem the million notes in october this increase in cash from sales and maturities of marketable securities was offset by million in capital expenditures primarily attributable to purchases of new research and development emulation equipment  technology licenses and software and million for the acquisition of mediaq 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures during fiscal  primarily for software licenses  emulation equipment  computer and engineering workstations 
in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 
financing activities used cash of million during fiscal compared to cash provided of million in fiscal the increase in cash used in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the million redemption of the notes  which included million of notes that we had purchased during the three months ended october  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our ne ed to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
for additional factors see business risks our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline 
other key factors that could affect our liquidity include shelf registration statement in december  we filed a form s with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  under their shelf registration process 
this shelf registration was declared effective by the sec on march  under this shelf registration process  we may sell common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts and or stock purchase units in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement  we intend to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
in particular  we expect to incur significant operating expenses in connection with continuing to develop our technology  hiring additional personnel  expanding our sales and marketing organization and activities  acquiring complementary technologies or businesses  and capital expenditures dfx asset purchase the dfx asset purchase closed on april  under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the cash consideration due at the closing was million  less million that was loaned to dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december  the asset purchase agreement also provided  subject to the other provisions thereof  that if dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for  then we would have been obligated to pay dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock 
if dfx could not make such a certification  but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than million  then dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced n umber of shares of our common stock  with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by per share 
if dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for  or could not be satisfied  for less than million  we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 
we are currently party to litigation relating to certain aspects of the asset purchase and dfx s subsequent bankruptcy in october please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this litigation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if inte rest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because our debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
business risks in addition to the risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our business is subject to the risks set forth below 
risks related to our operations failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost 
manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs 
we currently use micron  micron and micron process technologies for our family of gpus  mcps and umps 
the majority of our newest gpus  the geforce fx and the geforce fx go products are manufactured in micron process technology 
we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
on february   we announced that we will be one of the first semiconductor companies to manufacture select up coming gpus at tsmc s um micron process technology 
we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we may continue to have difficulty migrating to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
our inability to transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and harm our gross margins 
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and or new products would reduce our gross margins 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design  which is developed largely by us  and process technology  which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 
because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers  any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships  as well as revenue and gross profit 
our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or rec all  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
marv burkett and david shannon are our only officers or employees bound by an employment agreement  and so our relationships with our other officers and employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees  particularly jen hsun huang  our president and chief executive officer  would harm our business 
our success will depend on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 
our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory that could adversely affect our gross margins 
inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to write down our inventory and our gross margins could be adversely affected 
our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 
many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses 
as a result  it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue  gross profit and results of operations 
factors that have affected our results of operations in the past  and could affect our results of operations in the future  include the following demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  the successful development and volume production of next generation products  new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products in accordance with original equipment manufacturers  or oems  design requirements and design cycles  changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields  declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the us and international economies  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues  the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship  seasonal fluctuations associated with the pc market  substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  equipment failure  terrorism or other cause  supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers products  including memory devices  our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products  legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits  customer receivable bad debt write offs  costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products  unexpected inventory write downs  and introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers 
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory  which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations 
we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in co nnection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems 
we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 
to stay competitive  we may have to invest more resources in research and development 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts  our business could suffer 
we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have  full time employees engaged in research and development as of january   compared to employees as of january  during fiscal years  and  research and development expenditures represented  and as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
risks related to our products pci express is central to our gpu as well as mcp strategies this year and the outcome of this strategy will impact our business 
pci express is expected to enable a new level of performance for high bandwidth applications like graphics and networking 
the transition to pci express  which is extremely complex  is central to our gpu and mcp strategies this year 
we intend to lead this transition using a pci express high speed interconnect  or hsi 
hsi is a complex piece of networking technology that performs high speed bi directional interconnect protocol conversion 
using hsi  we expect to transform some of our gpus into pci express compatible gpus 
with our pci express compatible gpus  we expect that our partners will be able to launch pci express compatible solutions in april during fiscal  we expect to launch and be in full production with a top to bottom product line of next generation pci express gpus based on our brand new nvx architecture 
if we fail to deliver pci express in a timely manner or if our pci express compatible products do not meet consumer and or analysts expectations  our business could suffer 
we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 
our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for our target segments 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers  original design manufacturers  or odms  and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  typically based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
this requires that we do the following anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand  incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of oems  odms  cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers  price our products competitively  and introduce the products to the market within the limited window for oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the success of new product introductions will depend on several factors  including the following proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability of international business machines  or ibm  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  united microelectronics corporation  or umc  and any additional third party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner  the quality of any new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products 
a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design  or cad  industry 
we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders  including cadence design systems  inc  ikos systems  inc 
and synopsys  inc  often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products 
we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next generation development tools to design  simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the d graphics market and develop products that utilize leading edge technology on a rapid basis 
we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc manufacturers 
if these relationships are not successful  we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner 
in addition  our strategy includes utilizing the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems 
new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by oems  odms  add in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of personal computers and consumer electronics 
in addition  we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the oems design cycles and market demand 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products 
our failure to successfully develop  introduce or achieve market acceptance for new digital media processors would harm our business 
in particular  we experienced delays in the introduction of digital media processors using our next generation technology during the first half of fiscal and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 
our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 
as our digital media processors develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline 
in particular  we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our digital media processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases 
as a result  we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins 
in order for our digital media processors to achieve high volumes  leading pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our digital media processor for design into their products  and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them 
we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion new products 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers products  that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 
as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases  there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development  introduction or volume shipment of our products 
we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed 
in addition  we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products 
failure to achieve any of the foregoing with r espect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices  reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share 
in addition  technologies developed by others may render our digital media processors non competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory  any of which would harm our business 
we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 
products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future 
errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution 
as a result  our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution 
if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution  we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
risks related to our partners we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of these customers 
we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated 
our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers 
these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers 
our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems  odms  motherboard manufacturers  add in board manufacturers and stocking representatives  each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems 
currently  we sell a significant majority of our digital media processors dire ctly to stocking representatives  cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers  which then sell boards with our graphics processor to leading pc oems  retail outlets and to a large number of system builders 
as a result  our business could be harmed by the loss of business from pc oems  cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers 
in addition  revenue from pc oems  cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  may not continue  or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income  which could harm our business 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
as of the of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our allowance for doubtful accounts represented  and of revenue for each fiscal year  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our opera ting results 
we may have to record additional reserves or write offs in the future  which could harm our business 
we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which would harm our business 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
our products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
we utilize tsmc  ibm and umc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging 
our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity at tsmc 
we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields  and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis 
these manufacturers may be unable to meet our near term or long term manufact uring requirements 
we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis 
tsmc has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product 
tsmc  ibm and umc fabricate wafers for other companies  including certain of our competitors  and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
because the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product 
we believe that long term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc  ibm  umc and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 
any difficulties like these would harm our business 
there can be no assurance that ibm will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis 

on march   we announced that we have formed a multi year strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our next generation geforce gpus 
as part of the agreement  we will gain access to ibm s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies  including power efficient copper wiring  and a roadmap that is designed to lead to nm nanometer  a billionth of a meter in the next several years  giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus 
ibm began manufacturing the next generation geforce graphics processor in july at ibm s plant in east fishkill  new york 
during the development of our relationship with ibm  our manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of ibm 
any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on third parties for assembly  testing and packaging of our products 
our digital media processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd  amkor technology  chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
as a result of our dependence on third party subcontractors for assembly  testing and packaging of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business 
due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components 
any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business 
we rely on third party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 
in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  we rely on third party software development tools 
while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools  some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future 
for example  we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from digital media processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us 
if the software development tools we use become unavailable or f ail to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could suffer 
microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services 
the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain 
on august   microsoft announced that it had entered into an agreement with one of our competitors to develop technology for future xbox products and services 
the impact that this announcement may have on our future revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft is uncertain  but we do not anticipate that it will have a significant impact upon us for at least months 
revenue from the sale of xbox processors to microsoft during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products 
in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products  services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels 
for any previous or future acquisition or investment  the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and  ultimately  could impair our ability to sell our products difficulty in combining the technology  operations or workforce of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing businesses  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 
in addition  the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
if the consideration is paid with our common stock  existing stockholders would be further diluted 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  a classified board of directors  and advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
on march   we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox 
in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock 
the provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia 
risks related to our competition the d graphics  platform processor and handheld industries are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 
the market for gpus  mcps and umps for pcs and handhelds in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of digital media processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours  or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products  which c ould harm our business 
our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu and mcp solutions for the pc and handheld segments 
our competitors include the following suppliers of mcps that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  intel  silicon integrated systems and via  suppliers of desktop standalone gpus that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  creative technology  matrox electronics systems ltd 
and xgi technology  inc  suppliers of notebook standalone gpus that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  silicon motion 
and the joint venture of a division of sonicblue incorporated formerly s incorporated and via  and suppliers of umps for handheld devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati and seiko epson 
if and to the extent we offer products outside of the personal computer  consumer electronics and handheld segments  we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete 
we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins  which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem and odm customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  generally based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem s product ca n be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature  which also could harm our business 
our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards 
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers  including intel and microsoft 
this would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 
risks related to market conditions we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 
our reliance on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly  testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism and war  which may delay the shipment of our products 
we also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
currently  all of our arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business 
our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change 
if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry  which can be unpredictable and rapid  in an efficient and timely manner  our operating results could suffer 
in particular  from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand  our revenues and earnings will suffer during downturns 
our products may not continue to be accepted by the pc and consumer electronics segments 
our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our digital media processors for d graphics in pc and consumer electronics applications 
the market for digital media processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products  often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results  changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add in boards  as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions 
only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance  if achieved  is difficult to sustain due to intense competition 
since the pc segment is our core business  our business would suff er if for any reason our current or future digital media processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc segment 
if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and cost effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc segment  our business would be harmed 
we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 
during fiscal  we derived the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop and notebook pc segments  including professional workstations 
we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop and notebook pc segments in the next several years 
a reduction in sales of pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales  will reduce demand for our products 
moreover  changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions 
in these cases  pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inve ntory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed 
hostilities involving the united states and or terrorist attacks could harm our business 
the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states led to a weakening of the global economy 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
political instability in taiwan and in the people s republic of china could harm our business 
because of our reliance on tsmc and umc  our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan  including the worsening of the strained relations between the people s republic of china and taiwan  or if relations between the us and the people s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events 
furthermore  any substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  political unrest  economic instability  acts of terrorism or war  equipment failure or other cause  could harm our business 
our stock price may continue to experience significant short term fluctuations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non company specific  such as the decline in the us economy  acts of terror against the us  war or due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation had been initiated against the issuing company 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because our debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
risks related to intellectual property  litigation and government action our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
the digital media processor industry in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions  and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions 
in addition  from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we expect that  as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases  and as competition in our product lines intensifies  the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase 
if infringement claims are made against us  we may seek licenses under the claimants patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us  particularly by competitors 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for certain claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products 
our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries 
our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products  including our digital media processors 
we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property 
we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions  the location in which our products are manufactured  our strategic technology or product directions in different countries  and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 
our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property 
our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 
we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors  and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products 
these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties  the cross licensing of technology by us or pa yment of other consideration 
if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we are currently subject to claims of patent infringement  and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other parties in the future 
these claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages 
future actions by the irs or sec or other governmental or regulatory agencies could harm our business 
as of january   the internal revenue service  or irs  closed our federal income tax return exam for our fiscal years ended january  and january  the results of our exam were submitted to the joint committee on taxation  or the joint committee  for review 
with our exam closed  we recorded the tax benefit of the settlement in our financial statements for the fiscal year ended january  because we had certainty as to the outcome of certain tax contingencies for which we had established liabilities 
however  the failure of the joint committee to agree with our settlement may result in a material adverse impact on the results of our operations in the period in which the matter is either resolved or in which an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
please refer to part ii  item results of operations income taxes and note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are subject to changes in financial accounting standards  which may affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct business 
the financial accounting standards board and various federal legislative proposals have proposed changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap  that may require us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options 
we currently us the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this method  we generally do no recognize compensation expense for an employee stock option when the exercise price of the stock option is equal to the fair market value on the date of grant 
if any change to us gaap is adopted that requires us to recognize compensation expense for our employee stock options  our reported results of operations may be adversely affected
