introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in as the parent of ipc and several other entities 
ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering over  square miles  primarily in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp s other operating subsidiaries include idatech developer of integrated fuel cell systems  idacorp financial services  inc ifs affordable housing and other real estate investments  velocitus commercial and residential internet service provider  idacomm provider of telecommunications services  ida west energy ida west developer and manager of independent power projects  and idacorp energy ie marketer of electricity and natural gas 
ie is in the late stages of winding down its operations 
in  idacorp began winding down ida west s operations  as discussed in results of operations ida west later in the md a 
while reading the md a  please refer to the consolidated financial statements of idacorp and ipc  which present the financial position at december  and  and the results of operations and cash flows for each company for the years ended december   and forward looking information in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of reform act  idacorp and ipc are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements as such term is defined in the reform act made by or on behalf of idacorp or ipc in this annual report on form k  any quarterly report on form q  in presentations  in response to questions or otherwise 
any statements that express  or involve discussions as to expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance often  but not always  through the use of words or phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  predicts  projects  will likely result  will continue or similar expressions are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking 
forward looking statements involve estimates  assumptions and uncertainties and are qualified in their entirety by reference to  and are accompanied by  the following important factors  which are difficult to predict  contain uncertainties  are beyond our control and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements changes in governmental policies and regulatory actions  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the idaho public utilities commission ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc  with respect to allowed rates of return  industry and rate structure  acquisition and disposal of assets and facilities  operation and construction of plant facilities  relicensing of hydroelectric projects  recovery of purchased power  recovery of other capital investments  present or prospective wholesale and retail competition including but not limited to retail wheeling and transmission costs and other refund proceedings  litigation resulting from the energy situation in the western united states  economic  geographic and political factors and risks  changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies  weather variations affecting customer energy usage  operating performance of plants and other facilities  system conditions and operating costs  population growth rates and demographic patterns  pricing and transportation of commodities  market demand and prices for energy  including structural market changes  changes in capacity  fuel availability and prices  changes in tax rates or policies  interest rates or rates of inflation  changes in actuarial assumptions  adoption or changes in critical accounting policies or estimates  exposure to operational  market and credit risk  changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures  capital market conditions  rating actions by moody s  standard poor s and fitch  competition for new energy development opportunities  results of financing efforts  including the ability to obtain financing on favorable terms  which can be affected by various factors  including credit ratings and general economic conditions  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  increasing health care costs and the resulting effect on health insurance premiums paid for employees and on the obligation to provide postretirement health care benefits  increasing costs of insurance  changes in coverage terms and the ability to obtain insurance  legal and administrative proceedings  whether civil or criminal  and settlements that influence business and profitability  and new accounting or securities and exchange commission requirements  or new interpretation or application of existing requirements 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors  nor can it assess the impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
risk factors the following are important factors that could have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of idacorp  inc and idaho power company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements reduced hydroelectric generation can significantly affect operating results 
idaho power company has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of idaho power company s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  the weather can significantly affect idaho power company s operations 
idaho power company experienced its fourth consecutive year of below normal water conditions in the water year and while the snowpack is near normal  streamflows are currently expected to remain below normal 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power company must increase its use of more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power 
through its power cost adjustment in idaho  idaho power company can expect to recover approximately percent of the increase in its idaho jurisdictional net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less sales for resale above the level included in its base rates 
the power cost adjustment recovery is on both a forecasted and deferred basis and is subject to the regulatory process 
the balance of its fuel and purchased power expense is subject to periodic recovery from its oregon and federal energy regulatory commission jurisdictional customers 
changes in temperature can reduce power sales and affect operating results 
idaho power company experienced warmer than usual temperatures in its service territory in the winter months of  which reduced sales 
warmer than normal winters or cooler than normal summers will reduce retail revenues from power sales 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may negatively affect earnings 
idaho power company is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for most of its hydroelectric projects 
idaho power company currently expects new licenses for five middle snake river region hydroelectric plants to be issued in in addition  idaho power company filed its license application on july  for the hells canyon complex  which provides percent of idaho power company s total generating capacity 
conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters that may be imposed by the federal energy regulatory commission in connection with the renewal of these licenses could have a negative effect on idaho power company s operations 
the cost of complying with environmental regulations can significantly affect operating results 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations involves significant capital  operating and other costs  and those costs could be even more significant in the future as a result of changes in legislation and enforcement policies and additional requirements imposed in connection with the relicensing of idaho power company s hydroelectric projects 
if the idaho public utilities commission does not grant requested rate relief  idaho power company s earnings and cash flow will be negatively affected 
idaho power company is proceeding through its idaho general rate case filed with the idaho public utilities commission on october   requesting million in additional annual revenue  or an average percent increase to base rates 
idaho power company has not had an overall base rate increase since since that time  idaho power company has invested more than million in its electrical system  experienced an increase in normal operating costs due to inflation and added nearly  customers 
if the idaho public utilities commission does not grant the requested rate relief  idaho power company s earnings and cash flow will be negatively impacted and its credit ratings may be downgraded 
terrorist threats and activities can significantly affect operating results 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities 
potential targets include generation and transmission facilities 
the effects of terrorist threats and activities could prevent idaho power company from purchasing  generating or transmitting power and result in lost revenues and increased costs 
idaho power company and its affiliate  idacorp energy  are subject to potential liabilities as a result of energy marketing operations 
as idacorp energy wound down its energy marketing operations  certain matters were identified that required resolution with the federal energy regulatory commission and the idaho public utilities commission 
the federal energy regulatory commission matters have been resolved  however  certain compensation issues remain to be resolved with the idaho public utilities commission 
in an idaho public utilities commission proceeding that has been underway since may  idaho power company  the idaho public utilities commission staff and several interested customer groups have been working to determine the appropriate compensation idacorp energy should provide to idaho power company for certain transactions between the affiliates 
the parties to the proceeding have executed a settlement agreement providing that an additional million will be flowed through the power cost adjustment mechanism to the idaho retail customers from april through december this agreement was filed with the idaho public utilities commission on february  and is subject to its approval 
this settlement should resolve all remaining compensation issues 
it is possible that other proceedings may be commenced against idaho power company or idacorp energy in connection with energy marketing 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are subject to costs and other effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims  including those that may arise out of the california energy situation 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are involved in a number of proceedings including a complaint filed against sellers of power in california  based on california s unfair competition law  a cross action wholesale electric antitrust case against various sellers and generators of power in california and the california refund proceeding at the federal energy regulatory commission 
other cases that are the direct or indirect result of the energy crisis in california include efforts by certain public parties to reform or terminate contracts for the purchase of power from idacorp energy and show cause proceedings at the federal energy regulatory commission that consider whether certain trading practices constituted gaming or acting in concert in furtherance of a gaming strategy 
to the extent the companies are required to make payments  earnings will be negatively affected 
it is possible that additional proceedings related to the california energy crisis may be filed in the future against idacorp  inc  idacorp energy or idaho power company 
increased capital expenditures can significantly affect liquidity 
increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission  distribution and generating systems 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power company s facilities was constructed many years ago 
aging equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures 
failure of equipment or facilities used in idaho power company s systems could potentially increase repair and maintenance expenses  purchased power expenses and capital expenditures 
a summary of and outlook for this section presents an overview of the most critical issues that idacorp and ipc are facing  and the significant items that affected idacorp s and ipc s operating results 
financial results idacorp s earnings per share eps of was a decrease from s per share 
several key factors impacted s results ipc earned per share in below normal streamflow conditions continue to affect ipc s hydroelectric generation capability 
lower than normal hydroelectric generation  combined with unplanned outages at thermal plants  resulted in a greater reliance on market purchases of electricity to meet the needs of its service territory 
these thermal outages  along with pension expense increases  were primary factors in a million increase to utility operation and maintenance expenses 
additionally  ipc reached tax settlements with the irs for the years  resulting in a million decrease to income tax expense 
idacorp energy wind down activity continued at ie  which posted a net loss of per share 
losses on the settlement of legal matters and other wind down costs were partially offset by a gain on the sale of the forward book of energy trading contracts 
ifs contributed per share  principally from the generation of federal income tax credits and tax depreciation benefits 
idatech contributed per share  which is an improvement of per share  due primarily to the successful resolution of existing contracts  including a million settlement of a contract related to the design  production and delivery of fuel cell systems 
ida west wrote down its remaining investment in the garnet project and two joint ventures and recorded a reserve on a note receivable  reducing eps by general rate case filing ipc is proceeding through its idaho general rate case that was originally filed with the ipuc on october  ipc requested approximately million annually in additional revenue  or an average percent increase to base rates 
on february   the ipuc staff and seven other intervenors filed their testimony with the ipuc 
the testimony covered revenue requirement and rate design issues 
the ipuc staff s proposal of million  a three percent overall increase to base rates  was the lowest recommendation of any of the parties 
copies of the parties testimony and exhibits can be viewed at the ipuc web site 
ipc has until march  to prepare its rebuttal to these recommendations 
formal hearings are scheduled to begin on march   and a final order is expected from the ipuc on may   with a june  effective date 
ipc has not had an overall base rate increase since since that time  ipc has invested more than million in its electrical system  experienced an increase in normal operating costs due to inflation and added nearly  customers 
ipc cannot predict what level of rate adjustment the ipuc will grant 
should the ipuc grant less than ipc s request  ipc might need to implement alternative strategies 
these strategies could result in the deferral or elimination of certain capital expenditures  greater reliance on purchased power to meet customer needs  other cost containment measures and the filing of another rate request with the ipuc 
hydroelectric generation and power supply costs ipc relies on low cost hydroelectric plants for a significant portion of its power supply 
in  ipc experienced its fourth consecutive year of below normal hydroelectric generating conditions  which necessitated increased reliance on higher cost thermal generation and purchased power 
unplanned outages at thermal plants further increased the need to purchase power 
increased reliance on purchased power and higher market prices for this power resulted in ipc absorbing approximately million of power supply costs that were not recovered through its power cost adjustment pca mechanism 
ipc absorbed approximately million in and million in with more normal generating conditions ipc would absorb lesser amounts of power supply costs 
there are early indications of some relief from depressed hydroelectric generating conditions 
the most recent hydrological survey projects that conditions in will be improved over  but remain below normal 
strategy during  idacorp refocused on a strategy called electricity plus  a back to basics strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
ipc continues to experience strong growth in its service area and this revised corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make substantial investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
the plus recognizes that through modest investments in idatech and idacomm  idacorp can preserve the potential for additional growth in shareowner value 
ifs  with its federal income tax credits  remains a key component of the revised corporate strategy 
wind down of non utility businesses the wind down of ie neared completion as major milestones were reached in several major legal issues were resolved during the year  the forward book of energy trading contracts was sold in august  ie s workforce  once as high as  has been eliminated  and million of a note receivable from overton power district no 
was collected in december 
at december  there were still a number of legal matters outstanding  as discussed in legal and environmental issues later in the md a 
the wind down of ida west began in the fourth quarter of  after a review of the prospects for that business 
idacorp s revised strategic direction did not include the development or acquisition of merchant related generation  which had been ida west s focus 
the fourth quarter of includes million in impairment charges related to remaining site costs of the garnet energy facility  investments in joint ventures and notes receivable 
dividend reduction in september  idacorp s annual dividend was reduced to per share from per share 
this action was taken in order to strengthen idacorp s financial position and its ability to fund ipc s growing capital expenditure needs 
the change took effect with the quarterly dividend paid on december  relicensing on july   ipc filed its application with the ferc to relicense the company s three dam hells canyon complex hcc 
the current license for hcc will expire in  however  the ferc requires applicants to file two years in advance of a license s expiration date 
hcc is the largest in ipc s system of hydroelectric generating plants and collectively  the hcc provides approximately two thirds of ipc s total hydroelectric generation capacity 
legal issues and regulatory matters idacorp  ipc and ie have been named as defendants in a number of legal cases 
major developments include contract disputes with truckee donner public utility district were settled  with no material impact on the companies  a contract related lawsuit filed by the public utility district no 
of grays harbor county  washington was dismissed with prejudice on january  this matter has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit  a contract dispute with overton power district no 
was settled  resulting in a million loss in the second quarter of in december  ie received million in final settlement of the contract  in february  the ferc resolved a matter related to the wind down of energy marketing  approving the assignment of certain wholesale power and transmission services agreements from ipc to ie  in may  the us bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement between the companies and enron in connection with claims ie had submitted in the enron bankruptcy proceeding for net pre petition obligations owed by enron to ie  primarily for power and energy delivered prior to the enron bankruptcy  and in february  vierstra dairy was awarded approximately million in damages for the alleged effect of electrical current on the health of vierstra s dairy cows 
ipc intends to appeal the jury decision 
critical accounting policies idacorp and ipc s discussion and analysis of their financial condition and results of operations are based upon their consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires idacorp and ipc to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  idacorp and ipc evaluate these estimates  including those related to rate regulation  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation  impairment of assets  income taxes  restructuring costs and bad debt 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and are the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
idacorp and ipc  based on their ongoing reviews  will make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
idacorp and ipc believe the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting for rate regulation a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets or return these regulatory liabilities  such recovery is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if ipc should determine in the future that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas  it would be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
ipc intends to seek recovery of all of its prudent costs  including stranded costs  in the event of deregulation 
however  due to the current lack of definitive legislation  ipc cannot predict whether it will be successful 
if ipc has to write off a material amount of the regulatory assets  this will have a material adverse effect on ipc s operating results 
pension expense ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees and an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors 
idacorp s and ipc s recorded pension expense for these plans is dependent on a number of factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several actuarial assumptions used in the valuations upon which pension expense is based 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management reviews these assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates about future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop these assumptions are extremely uncertain  and actual results could vary significantly from those used to develop the assumptions 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
based on recent market trends  the discount rate used for pension expense will be reduced to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical real returns after inflation for each asset class  based on a recognized index established for the asset class being measured s p index for large cap core stocks  russell growth for large cap growth stocks  etc historical real returns are then adjusted to include an inflation premium based on the current inflation environment 
currently a two percent inflation assumption is used in the asset modeling process 
pension expense income for these plans totaled million  million and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
for  pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the reduction of the discount rate noted above and returns on plan assets in that exceeded actuarial estimates 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in certain actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension expense discount rate rate of return in millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were made to the qualified plan in through  and none are expected in under the non qualified plan  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
payments were approximately million per year in though  and a similar amount is anticipated in please also refer to note of idacorp s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about pension expense  including results of the actuarial valuations  actuarial assumptions used to measure pension expense and information about plan assets 
contingent liabilities there are a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory  legal and tax matters 
contingent liabilities are provided for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies not meeting both those conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
the companies have made estimates of the ultimate resolution of all such matters  based on the facts and circumstances  opinions of legal counsel and other factors 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  reserves have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective  and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the current financial statements 
asset impairment idacorp has several assets that are tested for impairment in accordance with various accounting pronouncements 
those assets that were tested in include the following goodwill idacorp has million of goodwill related to its investments in velocitus  idacomm and idatech 
idacorp conducts its impairment tests under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
according to sfas  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  and more frequently when events occur or circumstances change that more likely than not would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
sfas requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of the impairment 
idacorp s recorded goodwill amounts were tested for impairment as required  and no impairment was noted 
the fair value calculations used for these tests require idacorp to make assumptions about items that are inherently uncertain 
assumptions related to future market demand  market prices and product costs could vary from actual results  and the impact of such variations could be material 
factors that could affect the assumptions include changes in economic conditions  success in developing marketable products and services and competitive conditions in the telecommunications and fuel cell industries 
long lived assets long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
swip ipc began developing the southwest intertie project swip in this project covers the construction and operation of a mile kilovolt transmission line that would connect ipc s system with california and the southwest 
ipc s investment consists predominantly of rights of way over public lands in idaho and nevada 
while no definitive action has taken place with swip in several years  discussions occur from time to time with parties interested in acquiring or joining with ipc in further development 
based on these discussions and management expectations about the ultimate development of swip  no impairment has been identified 
these expectations are based on assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
garnet during  ida west wrote down its remaining investment in the garnet energy facility  which was to be developed as a mw gas fired generation station 
originally  the garnet facility had been selected by ipc to meet future energy needs based on ipc s integrated resource plan irp and ipc entered into a power purchase agreement ppa to purchase the garnet facility s output 
due to dramatic changes in the electric industry  financing the project on acceptable terms under the ppa became impractical and ida west wrote down its million investment in equipment for the project in approximately million of costs related to the development of the garnet site remained  as the site continued to be viable for future generation development 
in  the ppa for garnet was terminated and ipc issued a request for proposal rfp for development of additional generation capability in ipc s service territory 
the rfp specifically prohibited affiliates of ipc  including ida west  from bidding 
accordingly  another project proposed by a party unaffiliated with ipc was selected  leading to management s determination that further development of the garnet project was improbable 
based on this conclusion  the remaining million investment in garnet was written off in investments ifs has affordable housing and other investments totaling million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
prior to the decision to wind down ida west s activities  ida west had the intent and ability to hold the investments for a time period sufficient to recover the recorded value 
based upon the change in management s intent  these investments were tested for impairment  and two of the investments were determined to be impaired  resulting in a write down of million in the impairment amounts are based on the estimated fair value of the investments 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the analysis is organized by operating segment  concentrating on the utility operations and energy marketing segments 
additional noteworthy information about the results of other segments is also included 
the following table presents eps broken down by operating segment eps of common stock utility operations energy marketing ifs ida west idatech other total eps return on year end common equity utility operations this section discusses ipc s utility operations  which are subject to regulation by  among others  the state public utility commissions of idaho and oregon and by the ferc 
the decrease in eps from utility operations in was primarily the result of the following factors eps decreased due to a change to the utility s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
this change was adopted in  and increased income million that year and million in eps decreased per share in because operating and maintenance expenses increased million in  due mainly to a million increase in pension expenses  a million increase in thermal plant maintenance costs and a million increase in transmission line maintenance 
eps increased per share in because in ipc wrote off million of regulatory assets related to the irrigation load reduction program 
the ipuc denied recovery of this amount in the increase in eps from utility operations in was primarily the result of the following factors eps increased due to a change adopted in to the utility s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
this change increased net income million in of that amount  million relates to the effect of adoption of the tax method on prior tax years 
eps increased because net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less sales for resale absorbed by the utility decreased million 
generation ipc relies on its hydroelectric plants for a significant portion of its power supply 
the availability of hydroelectric generation can significantly affect the amount of net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less sales for resale that ipc incurs 
most  but not all  of the power supply costs are recovered through the rates charged to customers 
generally  lower hydroelectric generation increases power supply costs  thereby increasing the amount of these costs that ipc absorbs 
in  ipc experienced its fourth consecutive year of below normal hydroelectric generating conditions  which increased reliance on higher cost thermal generation and purchased power 
unplanned outages at thermal plants further increased the need to purchase power 
the following table presents ipc s system generation for the last three years mwh of total generation total total system system hydroelectric thermal generation hydroelectric thermal generation normal a a normal hydroelectric generation represents the annual average based on median conditions  using streamflows  adjusted to the level of depletion 
normal thermal represents average generations for the past five years 
current snake river basin snowpack numbers suggest that streamflow conditions for will remain below normal 
ipc s february  snowpack accumulations were percent of normal  compared to percent at the same time a year earlier 
as of february   storage for selected reservoirs upstream of brownlee was percent of normal  compared to percent of normal a year earlier 
the us national weather service s northwest river forecast center is predicting april through july inflow into brownlee reservoir will be million acre feet maf 
the normal year average for inflow during that time is maf 
based on the above snowpack  reservoir storage and forecasted inflows  ipc is expecting its fifth year of below normal water conditions 
ipc currently plans to use wholesale purchases from the energy markets when necessary to meet its energy needs during  which  as noted above  will result in increased expenses 
general business revenue the following table presents ipc s general business revenues and mwh sales for the last three years revenue mwh residential commercial industrial irrigation total the following factors influenced the change in general business revenue vs 
decreased average rates  resulting from the pca  reduced revenue million 
the pca is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs  a million decrease in revenues due to the expiration in march of a take or pay contract with fmc astaris 
fmc astaris  formerly ipc s largest volume customer  closed its plants late in but was required under the contract to pay ipc for generation capacity regardless of delivery  a percent increase in general business customers increased revenue million  and milder weather and other usage factors reduced revenues by approximately million 
vs 
rate increases due to the annual pca increased revenues approximately million 
the pca is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs  customer growth in ipc s service territory increased approximately percent  resulting in a million increase in revenues  in many irrigation customers participated in a program to decrease their usage 
this program was not in effect during  resulting in increased sales to irrigation customers of million  and fmc astaris  previously ipc s largest volume customer  closed its pocatello  idaho manufacturing plant late in however  based on a take or pay contract with fmc astaris that requires payment for power regardless of delivery  ipc continued to receive payments from fmc astaris through march because of this  revenues from fmc astaris changed minimally  despite the significant decrease in mwh sold 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
revenues from off system sales increased due principally to higher average prices in the wholesale electricity markets 
vs 
in  revenues from off system sales decreased due to a percent decrease in volumes sold and a percent decrease in wholesale electricity prices  reflecting the return to a more normal wholesale energy market from what existed in purchased power purchased power purchases load reduction costs mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
volumes purchased increased due principally to two factors unplanned outages at ipc s thermal plants and increased sales to general business customers 
load reduction costs decreased million due to the expiration in march of the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction program  which is discussed further in regulatory issues fmc astaris settlement agreement 
vs 
purchased power costs decreased primarily due to a percent decline in average wholesale electricity prices  reflecting the return to a more normal wholesale energy market from what existed in volumes purchased declined principally because of a similar decrease in sales volumes 
load reduction payments decreased million due to expiration of the irrigation load reduction program and changes to the fmc astaris voluntary load reduction agreement 
fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expense decreased in due primarily to increased unplanned outages 
the most significant outage involved one of the two units of the north valmy steam electric generating plant valmy 
as the unit was being returned to service after an unplanned outage  a breakdown occurred  unrelated to the completed maintenance  forcing the unit out of service from late june to early september in the unit has been repaired and modernized controls and protection systems are in place 
additional maintenance was completed during the outage which should minimize the planned maintenance outage period for the unit 
ipc owns percent of valmy and is not the plant operator 
vs 
fuel expenses increased due to a nine percent increase in average coal prices  partially offset by a four percent decrease in thermal generation 
pca pca expense represents the effect of ipc s pca regulatory mechanism  which is discussed in more detail below in regulatory issues deferred power supply costs 
in   and  actual power supply costs fuel and purchased power less sales for resale exceeded those anticipated in the annual pca forecast  resulting in the deferral of a portion of those costs to subsequent years when they are to be recovered in rates 
as the revenues are being recovered  the deferred balances are amortized 
the following table presents the components of pca expense current year power supply cost deferral fmc astaris and irrigation program costs deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances write offs of disallowed costs total power cost adjustment other operations and maintenance expenses vs 
other operations and maintenance expenses increased million due principally to thefollowing qualified pension plan expenses increased million  maintenance of thermal plants rose million due to increased unplanned outages  primarily at the valmy plant  and transmission maintenance increased million  predominantly from increased tree trimming and pole maintenance costs of million  and because of insurance proceeds received in related to a outage of million 
vs 
other operation and maintenance expenses decreased million  due principally to the following ipc paid million in to lease portable generation equipment to protect against electricity supply shortages 
these costs were not incurred in  costs at thermal plants decreased million due to reduced unplanned outages  and qualified pension plan income decreased million 
energy marketing idacorp announced on june  that ie would wind down its power marketing operations due to changing liquidity requirements brought on by rating agencies  continued uncertainty in the regulatory and political environment and reduction of creditworthy counterparties 
on november   idacorp announced that it was terminating further evaluation of growth opportunities in the mid stream natural gas markets  and stated that ie would close its denver office by year end  would shut down its natural gas trading operation in houston by march and would further reduce its workforce in its boise operations through mid since these announcements in  ie has completed the major milestones outlined in the wind down of the business 
these milestones include the sale of ie s forward book of electricity trading contracts to sempra energy trading set in august  closing of the denver  houston and boise operations and the final workforce termination in november the sale of ie s forward book of electricity trading contracts to set was approved by the ferc on september  to date  all but one of ie s counterparties have consented to the assignment of its contracts to set 
for that counterparty  ie still retains the credit risk 
set entered into transactions with ie that mirror the transactions of the counterparty that has not consented to the assignment 
set also agreed to service these remaining contracts for ie 
the result of this agreement with set is that ie was able to close down its day to day operations in november as part of the sale of the forward book of electricity trading contracts  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with set  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and did not have a significant effect on the financial statements

the remaining termination benefit accrual will be paid out in and the remaining lease termination accrual will be paid out through termination benefit expenses relate to the termination of employees primarily energy traders and administrative support positions 
of the employees laid off  were hired by other idacorp subsidiaries  and thus received no severance benefits 
restructuring expenses are presented as selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income and restructuring accruals are presented as other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
in connection with the wind down of energy marketing  certain matters were identified that required resolution with the ferc and the ipuc 
the ferc matters have been resolved by the issuance of two ferc orders and the parties to the ipuc proceeding have executed a settlement agreement 
this agreement was filed with the ipuc on february  and is subject to its approval 
these matters are discussed in more detail in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
ie reported an million operating loss in compared to a million of operating loss in ie realized a million gain from the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts in august this gain was offset by a loss on legal disputes of million  legal expenses of million  acceleration of depreciation expense of million  restructuring expenses of million and general and administrative costs of million 
on december   ie received a million cash payment from overton power district no 
for final settlement 
overton had a million long term receivable with ie  and this payment resulted in a million expense to ie in december in addition  ie recorded a write down of million related to this receivable in the second quarter of these write downs are presented as a net loss on legal disputes on the consolidated statement of income 
the following table presents ie s energy marketing revenues and volumes for the last three years increase increase decrease decrease net operating revenues electricity gas total operating volumes settled electricity mwh gas mmbtu the decline in revenues and volumes between and was a result of the decision to wind down ie s power and gas marketing operations and the sale of its forward book of electricity trading contracts to set in august the decision to wind down ie also affected the decline in revenues and volumes between and  along with a sharp decline in regional prices  volatility and the decreasing number of creditworthy counterparties in selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in as a result of the wind down of operations 
sg a expenses decreased million in due primarily to decreased allowance for bad debt and compensation expense compared to allowance for bad debt expense decreased in due to unusually high bad debt expense in associated with reserves related to trading activities conducted with california entities in compensation expense declined due to a reduction in profit related incentives and a reduction in workforce related to the wind down of operations 
ida west in  idacorp made the decision to wind down ida west s operations 
this decision resulted from the development of idacorp s new corporate strategy 
the new strategy does not include the development or acquisition of merchant generation  which had been ida west s focus 
idacorp will either sell ida west or retain its remaining properties and manage them with a smaller staff 
impairment charges  as discussed below  negatively affected ida west s earnings in both and in  ida west reported a million gain on the early redemption by the friant power authority of bonds held by ida west 
garnet impairment in  garnet  a wholly owned subsidiary of ida west  entered into a ppa with ipc to provide energy to be produced by garnet s proposed natural gas fired plant 
due to dramatic changes in the electricity industry  financing of the project on acceptable terms under the ppa became impracticable 
in  ida west wrote down million of its investment in equipment related to garnet 
at that time  the site remained viable for future generation development 
in  the original ppa was mutually terminated 
also in  ipc issued a formal rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to mw of additional generation 
the rfp specifically prohibited affiliates of ipc  including ida west  from bidding 
while one bid proposed acquisition and use of the garnet site  a different bid was selected 
based on the termination of the ppa  the results of the rfp process and the decision to wind down operations  ida west determined that its remaining million investment in the garnet site development costs was uncertain of recovery and an impairment charge for the entire amount was recorded 
each of these impairments is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other operating expenses 
joint ventures based on management s new corporate strategy  ida west s investments in four joint ventures were evaluated for impairment 
as a result  a total of million in impairment charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of to partially impair two of the joint ventures 
this impairment is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other expenses 
in addition  a million bad debt reserve was established on a note receivable from a partner in one of the joint ventures 
this reserve is presented on the consolidated statement of income as other operating expenses 
income taxes audit settlements in  idacorp settled substantially all issues related to the internal revenue service s examination of its federal income tax returns for the years through the settlement resulted in a benefit of million  as the deficiencies assessed were less than previously accrued 
management believes that adequate provision for income taxes has been made for the open years and after and for any unsettled issues prior to of this settlement benefit amount  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
in  ipc settled income tax deficiencies related to its partnership investment in the bridger coal company  covering the years through the settlement resulted in deficiencies that were less than previously accrued  enabling ipc to decrease income tax expense by approximately million 
tax accounting method change in  idacorp filed its federal income tax return and adopted a change to ipc s tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs 
the former method allocated such costs primarily to construction of plant  while the new method allocates such costs to both construction of plant and the production of electricity 
the tax accounting method change decreased income tax expense by million  of which million was attributable to and prior tax years  and million was attributable to the tax year 
the decrease to tax expense was a result of deductions on the applicable tax returns of costs that were capitalized into fixed assets for financial reporting purposes 
deferred income tax expense was not provided because the prescribed regulatory accounting method does not allow for inclusion of such deferred tax expense in current rates 
regulated enterprises are required to recognize such adjustments as regulatory assets if it is probable that such amounts will be recovered from customers in future rates 
tax credits ifs generates federal income tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation benefits related to its investments in affordable housing and historic rehabilitation developments 
net reductions in consolidated income taxes related to ifs tax credits were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows idacorp s and ipc s operating cash flows in were million and million  respectively 
ipc s operating cash flows have decreased million from s level  which had been bolstered by tax refunds and the collection from electricity customers of power supply expenditures that had been incurred during prior years 
net income tax related cash inflows of million in changed to outflows of million in and cash received from electric customers was approximately million less in than in the tax refunds received in totaled approximately million and related to the change in tax accounting method for capitalized overhead costs and net operating loss carrybacks associated with ipc s power supply costs 
idacorp s consolidated cash flows from operations decreased million in  resulting from the ipc items mentioned above  offset by cash generated during the wind down of the energy marketing 
net operating cash flows from ie were million in  an improvement of million over  with the largest contributions being million from the sale of the book of forward energy trading contracts and million collected on notes receivable from overton power district no 
ie s future cash flows are expected to be limited 
its only significant remaining asset is million in receivables  including million from california entities  the collection of which is uncertain and for which reserves of million have been established 
the resolution of the other legal and regulatory matters discussed later in md a could also impact ie s future cash flows 
working capital the wind down of energy marketing has been the primary influence on changes in idacorp s working capital items during the year 
energy marketing assets and liabilities reflect the fair value of energy marketing contracts as of the reporting date 
the fair value of these contracts is unrealized and therefore does not necessarily indicate a current source or use of funds 
the decreases in the net energy marketing assets and liabilities from to are a reflection of the wind down of the energy marketing business and sale of ie s book of forward electricity trading contracts 
pension expense income totaled million  million and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor costs 
for  pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account a reduction of the discount rate from the percent used in to percent and returns on plan assets in that exceeded actuarial estimates 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
insurance expenses ipc s medical expenses for current and retired employees increased approximately million from to this increase reflects the overall trends in health care costs and resulting health insurance premiums 
in addition  ipc s property and liability insurance expense increased approximately million from to  reflecting higher premiums to insure power plants and other utility property 
ipc forecasts that its insurance costs will continue to increase  but more moderately than in dividend reduction in september  idacorp s annual dividend was reduced to per share from per share 
this action was taken in order to strengthen idacorp s financial position  and its ability to fund ipc s growing capital expenditure needs 
ipc s capital expenditures from to are expected to total million  significantly more than the million expended in through ipc s construction program is discussed in more detail later in capital requirements 
the dividend reduction was also made to strengthen financial position  improve cash flows and help maintain credit ratings

off balance sheet arrangements ipc has guaranteed the performance of reclamation activities of its bridger coal company joint venture 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december  bridger coal has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying these reclamation costs and expects that the fund will be sufficient to cover all such costs 
because of the existence of the fund  the estimated fair value as well as the impact on the consolidated financial statements of this guarantee was minimal 
in august  ie sold its forward book of electricity trading contracts to set 
as part of the sale of the forward book of electricity contracts ie entered into an indemnity agreement with set  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the impact of this guarantee on the consolidated financial statements was minimal 
credit ratings on october   s p changed its rating outlook for idacorp and ipc to stable from positive 
s p stated that the stable rating outlook reflected the belief that overall financial ratios will only meet expectations for an a rating over the next two to three years 
s p also changed the idacorp business risk profile to a from a on a point scale  where a is the least risky 
ipc s business risk profile remains a access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality

capital requirements the following table presents idacorp s and ipc s expected capital requirements from through millions of dollars ipc utility capital expenditures construction expenditures excluding afdc generating facilities hydro thermal total generating facilities transmission lines and substations distribution lines and substations general total construction expenditures excluding afdc long term debt maturities other total ipc utility ifs capital expenditures ifs long term debt maturities other total idacorp variations in the timing and amounts of capital expenditures will result from regulatory and environmental factors  load growth and other resource acquisition needs and the timing of relicensing expenditures 
idacorp forecasts indicate that internal cash generation after dividends is expected to provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through the contribution for internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs 
idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and externally financed capital 
utility construction program construction expenditures were million in  million in and million in however  aging facilities  relicensing costs and projected load growth are expected to increase construction expenditures over the next three years 
ipc s coal fired plants are approaching their fourth decade of service and plant utilization has increased due to both load growth and reduced hydroelectric generation resulting from below normal water conditions 
these factors result in increased upgrade and replacement requirements and plant additions such as the bennett mountain power plant bmpp  which is currently estimated to cost million 
bmpp is discussed in more detail later in the md a in regulatory issues 
ipc s aging hydroelectric facilities require continuing upgrade and component replacement 
in addition  costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities are expected to increase substantially 
the three year construction program anticipates million of upgrades to existing hydroelectric facilities and million of costs associated with relicensing of hydroelectric facilities 
continuing load growth also requires that ipc add to its transmission and distribution facilities system to provide new service and to maintain reliability 
planned expenditures include distribution lines for new customers and several high voltage transmission lines 
ipc has no nuclear involvement and its future construction plans do not include development of any nuclear generation 
based upon present environmental laws and regulations  ipc estimates its capital expenditures for environmental matters  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afdc  will total million 
studies and measures related to environmental concerns at ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and investments in environmental equipment and facilities at the thermal plants account for million 
from through  environmental related capital expenditures  excluding afdc  are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million 
other capital requirements most of idacorp s non regulated capital expenditures relate to ifs s investment in affordable housing developments that help lower idacorp s tax liability 
financing programs idacorp s consolidated capital structure fluctuated slightly during the three year period  with common equity ending at percent  preferred stock of ipc at three percent and long term debt at percent at december  credit facilities idacorp has a million facility that expires on march  and a million facility that expires on march  under these facilities idacorp pays a facility fee on the commitment  quarterly in arrears  based on its corporate credit rating

ipc s commercial paper may be issued up to the amount supported by the bank credit facilities 
at december   ipc had regulatory authority to incur up to million of short term indebtedness 
idacorp and ipc plan to renew their credit facilities that expire in march idacorp plans to replace its current million day facility  and its million year facility  with a reduced million year facility resulting from lower liquidity requirements at idacorp 
ipc plans to replace its current million day facility with a similar sized million year facility 
short term financings at december   ipc had no short term borrowings compared to million at december  at december   idacorp s short term borrowing totaled million  compared to million at december  idacorp s short term borrowings decreased in due to lower liquidity requirements as a result of the decision to exit the power and natural gas trading and marketing business

ipc plans to refund its million first mortgage bonds series due march  with additional first mortgage bonds 
the following tax credit notes were issued by ifs during issue date march  july  series principal amount interest rate maturity outstanding at december  additionally  ifs borrowed million from a corporate lender on july  at an interest rate of percent 
this debt matures from at december   the amount outstanding was million

the debt for series is non recourse to both ifs and idacorp 
the debt for the remaining two issuances is recourse only to ifs 
debt covenants idacorp and ipc are subject to several debt covenants and restrictions 
under the terms of the indenture relating to ipc s first mortgage bonds  net earnings must be at least two times the annual interest on all bonds and other equal or senior debt

california energy proceedings at the ferc ie and ipc are involved in a number of ferc proceedings arising out of the california energy situation 
they include proceedings involving the chargeback provisions of the california power exchange calpx participation agreement  which was triggered when a participant defaulted on a payment to the calpx 
upon such a default  other participants were required to pay their allocated share of the default amount to the calpx 
this provision was first triggered by the southern california edison sce default and later by the pacific gas electric company pg e default 
ferc has ordered the calpx to rescind all chargeback actions related to the sce and pg e liabilities 
the calpx is awaiting further orders from the ferc and bankruptcy court before distributing the funds it collected under the chargeback mechanism  efforts by the state of california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales prices from sellers of electricity into california from october  through june  california is claiming that the prices were not just and reasonable and were not in compliance with the federal power act fpa 
the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march  which multiple parties  including ie  sought rehearing on 
on october   ferc denied the requests for rehearing and required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing regarding refund amounts by august at december   with respect to the calpx chargeback and the california refund proceedings discussed above  the calpx and the cal iso owed million and million  respectively  for energy sales made to them by ipc in november and december ie has accrued a reserve of million against these receivables 
this reserve was calculated taking into account the uncertainty of collection  given the california energy situation 
based on the reserve recorded as of december   idacorp believes that the future collectibility of these receivables or any potential refunds ordered by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operation or cash flows  in the pacific northwest refund proceedings it was argued that the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market  warranting refunds 
the ferc rejected this claim on june  and denied rehearing on november  and february  the ferc orders have been appealed to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter  and two cases which result from a ruling of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit that the ferc permit the california parties in the california refund proceeding to submit materials to the ferc demonstrating market manipulation by various sellers of electricity into california 
on june   the ferc ordered a large number of parties including ipc to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or anomalous market behavior partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
on october   ipc reached agreement with the ferc staff staff on the show cause orders 
the gaming settlement was approved by the ferc on march  the ferc approved the motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding on january  although the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit  the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests 
the order approving the gaming settlement is subject to rehearing requests for days 
the ferc also issued an order instituting an investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western wholesale power markets 
the company has submitted all data and information requested by the ferc and is awaiting ferc action  and idacorp and ipc believe that any potential penalties imposed by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
these matters are discussed in detail in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
other legal proceedings idacorp  ipc and or ie are involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  discussed above and in detail in note to idacorp s consolidated financial statements 
the companies believe they have meritorious defenses to all lawsuits and legal proceedings where they have been named as defendants 
resolution of any of these matters will take time  and the companies cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings 
the companies believe that their reserves are adequate for these matters 
other legal issues us commodity futures trading commission investigations regarding trading practices on october   the us commodity futures trading commission cftc issued a subpoena to ipc requesting  among other things  all records related to all natural gas and electricity trades by ipc involving round trip trades  also known as wash trades or sell buyback trades including  but not limited to those made outside the western systems coordinating council region 
the subpoena applies to both ie and ipc 
by letter from the cftc dated october   the division of enforcement agreed to hold in abeyance until a later date all items requested in the subpoena with the exception of one paragraph which related to three trades on a certain date with a specific party 
the companies provided the requested information 
on january   ipc received a request from the cftc  pursuant to the october subpoena  for documents related to round trip or wash trades and information supplied to energy industry publications 
the request applies to both ipc and ie 
the companies stated in their response to the cftc that they did not engage in any round trip or wash trade transactions and that they believe the only information provided to energy industry publications was actual transaction data 
the companies have provided the requested information and have heard nothing further from the cftc 
idaho power company transmission line rights of way across fort hall indian reservation ipc has multiple transmission lines that cross the shoshone bannock tribes fort hall indian reservation near the city of pocatello in southeastern idaho 
ipc has been working since to renew five of the right of way permits for the transmission lines  which have stated permit expiration dates between and ipc has filed applications with the united states department of the interior  bureau of indian affairs  to renew the five rights of way for years  including payment of the independently appraised value of the rights of way to the tribes and the tribal allottees who own portions of the rights of way 
the tribes have not agreed to renew the rights of way and have demanded a substantially greater payment of million  including an up front payment of million with the remainder to be paid over the year term of the permits  or in the alternative million including an up front payment of million with the remainder paid over the first three years of the permits 
this is based on an opportunity cost methodology  which calculates the value of the rights of way as a percentage of the cost to ipc of relocating the transmission lines off the reservation 
both parties have discussed potential legal action regarding renewal of the rights of way  but no such action has been taken to date 
the probable cost of renewing the rights of way is difficult to ascertain due to the lack of definitive legal guidelines for the renewals 
ipc believes that the amount payable for year rights of way should not exceed million  which represents the approximate present value of the offers communicated to date by the tribe 
ipc plans to obtain ipuc approval for the recovery of any renewal payment in its utility rates as a prerequisite to any settlement of the right of way renewals with the tribe 
environmental issues threatened and endangered snails in december  the united states fish and wildlife service usfws listed five species of snails that inhabit the middle snake river as threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act esa 
in  in preparation for the ferc relicensing of certain of ipc s hydroelectric projects  ipc obtained a permit from the usfws to study the listed snails 
since that date  ipc has been collecting field data and conducting studies in an effort to determine the status of the listed snails and how they may be affected by a variety of factors  including hydroelectric production  water quality and irrigation practices 
based upon the studies initiated by ipc in  in july and october of  ipc  in cooperation with the state of idaho  filed petitions with the usfws to remove the bliss rapids snail and idaho springsnail from the federal list of threatened and endangered wildlife 
due to the pending relicensing proceedings at the ferc and the esa consultation between the ferc and the usfws on the potential effect of project operations on esa listed snails  ipc submitted the petitions  and the studies upon which they were based  to the ferc for inclusion in the mid snake and cj strike relicensing proceedings 
on december   because of inconsistencies discovered between the field data collected by ipc since  the macro invertebrate database into which the field data were entered and the use of that database in the preparation of the studies used to support the pending petitions  ipc notified the usfws and the ferc that it was withdrawing the petitions 
ipc then retained an independent scientist to review the snail studies 
this review was completed in april and ipc submitted the report to the ferc on april  the report identified discrepancies in the annual snail survey reports that were used to support the petitions to delist the bliss rapids snail and idaho springsnail 
these discrepancies included errors in summarization of field data and the entry of the data into the macro invertebrate database  errors in compiling data for analysis  calculation or extrapolation errors  and the lack of a standard measure for expressing snail relative abundance data 
while the report concluded that annual snail surveys were unreliable because of these discrepancies  it also concluded that the primary or underlying data that were used to prepare the annual survey reports appeared to be complete and  as a consequence  could be used to correct any errors in the annual reports 
due to the importance of these snail data to issues pending in the relicensing of ipc s hydroelectric projects and the pending esa consultation between the ferc and the usfws  ipc retained the independent scientist that conducted the review to analyze the primary data used to prepare the snail survey reports and to prepare new and corrected annual reports 
in october and november  ipc provided the ferc and the usfws with revised annual reports for by letters dated august   ipc and the usfws advised the ferc that they initiated efforts to reach a cooperative resolution of outstanding fish and wildlife issues associated with the relicensing of the mid snake and cj strike projects  including issues relating to threatened and endangered snails and advised the ferc that they hoped to complete these efforts within days of august  on august   the ferc responded to ipc advising it would not take action on the licenses prior to the expiration of the day period 
in subsequent progress reports to the ferc on ipc and the usfws efforts  ipc and the usfws requested an additional days to complete their discussions 
on december   ferc advised ipc and the usfws that it would take no action on the pending applications prior to the expiration of the day period 
on february   ipc  on behalf of itself and the usfws  presented an offer of settlement  including a signed settlement agreement and attached appendices  to the ferc addressing issues associated with the esa listed threatened and endangered snails and the relicensing of the mid snake and cj strike projects 
pursuant to ferc regulations  participants in the licensing proceeding and other interested persons have until march  to comment on the proposed settlement 
if the proposed settlement is approved by the ferc  it is expected that the ferc and the usfws will complete esa consultation on the projects and the ferc will thereafter issue new licenses for the projects

regulatory issues general rate case ipc filed an application with the ipuc on october  to increase its general rates an average of percent 
if approved  ipc s revenues would increase million annually based on the proposed percent return on equity 
an additional component of the filing was a request for interim rate relief of million 
the ipuc turned down ipc s request for interim rate relief in order no 
on december  noting that the denial of interim rate relief was not an indication of the ultimate merits of the case 
in addition  ipc has proposed extensive rate design changes including seasonal rates for most customers  increased fixed charges for smaller customer classes and time of day rates for industrial customers 
if approved  the price ipc charges its customers from june to august would reflect ipc s seasonably higher costs of producing or purchasing power 
the change would result in summer and non summer base rates 
in connection with the seasonal pricing proposal  ipc recommended the annual pca rate changes be implemented june each year instead of may if approved  this change would eliminate the need for back to back rate changes and the pca recovery period would be june through may on february   the ipuc staff and seven other intervenors filed their testimony with the ipuc 
the testimony covered revenue requirement and rate design issues 
the ipuc staff s proposal of million  a three percent overall increase to base rates  was the lowest recommendation of any of the parties 
copies of the parties increase in base rates testimony and exhibits can be viewed at the ipuc web site 
ipc has until march  to prepare its rebuttal to these recommendations 
ipc s proposal requests revenue recovery for certain costs of serving its customers  such as increased operating expenses and substantial demands for infrastructure improvements  increased capital costs for the pm e requirements of new licenses at most of its hydroelectric projects  for the cost of new sources of power and continued expansion of its transmission and distribution network 
because the idaho jurisdiction does not allow assets that have not been placed in service to be included in the rate base  bmpp and relicensing costs included in construction work in process cwip are not included in this filing 
ipc is requesting an percent return on equity and an overall rate of return of percent 
the success of this rate case is dependent on the ipuc review and approval  which could take up to seven months from the filing date 
ipc is unable to predict what rate relief the ipuc will grant 
deferred power supply costs ipc s deferred power supply costs consist of the following at december  and oregon deferral idaho pca current year power supply cost deferrals deferral for rate year deferral for rate year astaris load reduction agreement idaho pca true up awaiting recovery irrigation and small general service deferral for recovery in the rate year industrial customer deferral for recovery in the rate year remaining true up authorized may remaining true up authorized may total deferral idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments  which take effect in may  are based on forecasts of net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less sales for resale and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called a true up  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca adjustment 
on april   ipc filed its pca with the ipuc  and  with a small adjustment to the filing  the rates were approved by the ipuc and became effective on may  as approved  ipc s rates have been adjusted to collect million above base rates  a million reduction from the pca 
so far in the pca rate year  actual power supply costs have exceeded those anticipated in the forecast  due principally to greater reliance on  and higher market prices for  purchased power 
below normal water conditions also continue to negatively impact forecasted and actual power supply costs 
on may   the ipuc issued order no 
related to the pca rate filing 
the order granted recovery of million of excess power supply costs  while it denied recovery of million of lost revenues resulting from the irrigation load reduction program  and million of other costs ipc sought to recover 
the ipuc had previously issued order no 
on april  disallowing the lost revenue portion of the irrigation load reduction program 
ipc believes that this ipuc order is inconsistent with order no 
 dated may   that allowed recovery of such costs  and ipc filed a petition for reconsideration on may  on august   the ipuc issued order no 
denying the petition for reconsideration 
as a result of this order  approximately million was expensed in september ipc still believes it should be entitled to receive recovery of this amount and argued its position before the idaho supreme court on december  if successful  ipc would record any amount recovered as revenue 
in the may pca filing  ipc requested recovery of million of power supply costs 
the ipuc subsequently issued order no 
authorizing recovery of million  but deferring recovery of million pending further review 
the approved amount resulted in an average rate increase of percent 
after conducting hearings on the remaining million  the ipuc  in order no 
 authorized recovery of million plus million of accrued interest  beginning in october the remaining million not recovered in rates from the pca filing was written off in september in october  ipc filed an application with the ipuc for an order approving inclusion in the pca of costs incurred for the irrigation load reduction program and the fmc astaris load reduction agreement 
these two programs were implemented in to reduce demand and were approved by the ipuc and the opuc 
the costs incurred in for these two programs were million for the irrigation load reduction program and million for the fmc astaris load reduction agreement 
the ipuc subsequently issued order no 
authorizing ipc to include direct costs it has accrued in the programs  subject to later adjustments in the pca year 
as mentioned earlier  the ipuc also denied ipc s request to recover lost revenues experienced from the irrigation load reduction program 
oregon ipc also filed applications with the opuc to recover calendar year extraordinary power supply costs applicable to the oregon jurisdiction 
in two separate orders  the opuc approved rate increases totaling six percent  which is the maximum annual rate of recovery allowed under oregon state law 
these increases are recovering approximately million annually 
the oregon deferred balance was million as of december  during the oregon legislative session  the maximum annual rate of recovery was raised to ten percent under certain circumstances 
ipc expects to request the higher recovery percentage in the spring of fmc astaris settlement agreement on january   the ipuc initiated an investigation to examine the load reduction rates contained in the voluntary load reduction vlr agreement between ipc and fmc astaris 
this vlr agreement amended the electric service agreement esa that governed the delivery of electric service to fmc astaris pocatello  idaho plant  which ceased operations late in on june   ipc and fmc astaris signed and filed a proposed stipulation and settlement agreement agreement with the ipuc and on june   the ipuc approved the agreement in order no 
which included the following provisions the vlr payments that ipc would have made to fmc astaris through may were decreased million  reducing ipc s overall payments to million 
approximately percent of this million reduction flowed through the pca mechanism as a reduction in costs to idaho retail customers 
fmc astaris dismissed  with prejudice  a declaratory judgment action concerning the fmc astaris contract that it had previously filed against ipc in the fourth judicial district for the state of idaho 
fmc astaris paid ipc approximately million through march to settle the esa 
ipc s need to purchase power from the wholesale markets decreased during due to the ceased operation of fmc astaris pocatello  idaho plant and settlement of the above mentioned esa 
integrated resource plan every two years  ipc is required to file with both the ipuc and opuc an irp  a comprehensive analysis of ipc s present and future demands for electricity and the plan for meeting that demand 
the irp identified the need for additional resources to address potential electricity shortfalls within ipc s utility service territory by mid originally  the garnet plant was selected as the resource to meet future needs 
however  the garnet plant did not prove to be financially viable and the irp action plan was modified  as explained below 
on february   the ipuc issued order no 
 which accepted and acknowledged ipc s irp as modified  and directed ipc to implement certain changes in its irp related to both the public process and the evaluation of demand side options 
the accepted irp indicated the purchase of mw from the wholesale market for ipc s retail customers during june  july  november and december 
the draft irp should be available in the spring of and the final irp will be published and filed with the ipuc and the opuc in june the ipc service territory population continues to increase and it is expected that the irp will identify the need for additional capacity 
ppl montana power purchase agreement during may  ipc and ppl montana  llc pplm entered into a firm wholesale ppa under which ipc will purchase energy from pplm to address increased demand during june  july and august from through with the exception of the month of august  in which the quantity of energy to be purchased is mw per hour  during each month of the ppa ipc will purchase mw per hour from pplm at a price of per mwh 
after deducting transmission losses  ipc will receive approximately mw per hour 
the ipuc approved this ppa on july  bennett mountain power plant on february   ipc issued a formal rfp seeking bids for the construction of up to mw of additional generation to support the growing seasonal demand for electricity in ipc s service area 
as a result of this process  ipc selected tr as the successful bidder for the construction of the bmpp  a mw gas fired generating plant near mountain home  idaho 
tr has contracted with siemens westinghouse power corporation to furnish all of the labor  equipment and materials and to perform all of the engineering and construction of the plant 
the estimated project cost  including plant construction and associated transmission system upgrades  is million 
ipc will take ownership of the plant once it is fully tested and operational 
ipc filed an application with the ipuc on september  for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the bmpp 
on october   the ipuc issued order no 
placing the case on modified procedure 
the ipuc approved the certificate to bmpp through order no 
and order no 
advanced meter reading on february   the ipuc issued order no 
which directed ipc to submit a plan no later than march  to replace its existing meters with advanced meters that are capable of both automated meter reading and time of use pricing 
on april   the ipuc issued order no 
 which modified and clarified order no 
the requirement to commence installation in was removed  however  ipc was expected to implement advanced meter reading amr as soon as practicable  subject to updated analysis showing amr to be cost effective for customers 
as ordered by the ipuc  ipc submitted an updated analysis on may  a workshop with ipuc staff and other interested parties to discuss the analysis was held on may  the ipuc issued order no 
on july   providing interested parties the opportunity to submit comments regarding ipc s updated analysis 
on october   the ipuc issued order no 
which directed ipc to collaboratively develop and submit a phase one amr implementation plan to replace current residential meters with advanced meters in selected service areas 
ipc complied with this order on december  by filing a phase one implementation plan that targeted the emmett  idaho and mccall  idaho areas for installation and implementation 
phase one is estimated to cost million 
ipc will include these costs in future rate filings 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size and complexity of the project 
currently  the licenses for five hydroelectric projects have expired 
these projects continue to operate under annual licenses until the ferc issues a new multi year license 
three more of ipc s hydroelectric project licenses will expire by ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of these projects  a process that may continue for the next ten to years 
the current status of ipc s relicensing efforts is summarized in the table below projects current status bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon annual licenses issued under terms and conditions of the expired falls  shoshone falls and cj strike multi year license 
final environmental impact statements have been issued 
ferc licenses anticipated in upper malad and lower malad license expires in new license application filed in july brownlee oxbow hells canyon hcc license expires in new license application filed in july the most significant relicensing effort is the hcc  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generation capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
ipc developed the license application for the hcc through a collaborative process involving representatives of state and federal agencies  businesses  environmental  tribal  customer  local government and local landowner interests 
the license application for the hcc was filed in july the application includes existing and proposed pm e measures estimated to total assuming a year license approximately million in the first five years of the license and million over the following years 
however  the actual costs of the pm e measures and other costs associated with the relicensing of the project will not be known until the new license is issued by the ferc 
the current license for the project expires in july ipc will thereafter operate the project under annual licenses issued by the ferc until the new multi year license is issued 
the four mid snake river projects bliss  upper salmon falls  lower salmon falls and shoshone falls and the cj strike projects may affect five species of snails listed under the esa 
see previous discussion in legal and environmental issues environmental issues threatened and endangered snails 
at december   million of relicensing costs were included in cwip and million of relicensing costs were included in electric plant in service 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in cwip until a new multi year license or annual license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges are transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to the new licenses  as discussed above  will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the rate making process 
the current idaho general rate case filing includes million of relicensing costs 
american rivers petition on may   american rivers and idaho rivers united petitioned the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit requesting that the court issue a writ of mandamus compelling the ferc to respond to a petition american rivers filed with the ferc in requesting that the ferc initiate formal consultation pursuant to section a of the esa with the national marine fisheries service nmfs on the effects of the ongoing operations of ipc s hcc on four species of snake river salmon and steelhead trout that are listed as threatened or endangered under the esa 
american rivers contends that consultation is necessary because the operations of the hcc have a current  adverse impact on the listed anadromous fish 
ipc contested the petition before the ferc on several bases first  that there is no evidence to support the american rivers contention that the operations of the hcc have an adverse impact on esa listed species  and second  that neither the esa nor the fpa grant the ferc the type of discretionary federal control that constitutes the consultation triggering federal action required under section a of the esa 
since  the ferc has taken no action on the pending petition  but has been engaged in informal discussions with ipc and the nmfs on issues associated with the effect of hcc operations on fishery resources below the hcc 
some of these discussions have occurred in the context of the snake river basin adjudication mediation  which is subject to a court imposed confidentiality order 
on june   the ferc filed a response to the petition for mandamus 
the ferc opposed the petition  first  because there was no federal action before the ferc to trigger a consultation responsibility under esa section a  second  because there was no evidence to substantiate the allegations of the petitioners that the esa listed species have continued to decline since the filing of the original petition with the ferc in  and lastly  because there were no grounds to support the allegations of unreasonable delay given the ongoing interaction between the ferc  ipc and other interested parties with regard to issues associated with the esa listed species and the hcc 
ipc filed a brief in support of the ferc s position on july  the petitioners filed a reply in support of the petition for mandamus with the court on july  the court granted ipc intervention and set the matter for oral argument on march  regional transmission organizations in december  the ferc  in its landmark order no 
 said that all companies with transmission assets must file to form regional transmission organizations rtos or explain why they cannot do so 
order no 
is a follow up to order nos 
and issued in  which required transmission owners to provide non discriminatory transmission service to third parties 
by encouraging the formation of rtos  the ferc seeks to further facilitate the formation of efficient  competitive wholesale electricity markets 
in october and march  in response to ferc order no 
 ipc and other regional transmission owners filed stage one and stage two plans to form rto west  an entity that would operate the transmission grid in seven western states 
rto west will have its own independent governing board 
the participating transmission owners will retain ownership of the lines  but will not have a role in operating the grid 
these ferc filings represent a portion of the filings necessary to form rto west 
additional filings will be necessary to include the tariff and integration agreements associated with the new entity 
state approvals also need to be obtained 
in september  the ferc issued an order granting in part rto west s stage two request for a declaratory order  approving with modification the majority of the proposed plan for development of a rto by ten utilities in the northwest and canada  including the bonneville power administration bpa 
ipc is one of the filing utilities 
with further development of detail and some modification  the ferc stated that the proposal will satisfy not only the order no 
requirements  but can also provide a basic framework for standard market design for the west 
further development of the rto west proposal by the filing utilities continues 
in mid  the rto west regional representatives group rrg began a new phase of discussions related to the development of an independent entity to manage the regional transmission system and improve related wholesale markets 
these discussions began with wide ranging consideration of current transmission problems and opportunities within the region 
in late summer and fall  task groups from the rrg focused on developing different option packages to address the region s transmission problems and opportunities 
as this effort proceeded  however  many regional parties felt it would be preferable to work toward a single proposal that could gain broad regional support 
to further this goal  the rrg formed a small task team to take into account all of the various perspectives  priorities and concerns that regional parties had identified during the course of discussions since june  and  working on behalf of the rrg as a whole  to develop the best proposal it could in view of these considerations 
in april  the ferc issued its white paper wholesale market platform  and appendix a comparison of the proposed wholesale market platform with the rto requirements of order no 
the wholesale market platform wmp white paper set forth the ferc s then current thinking on issues under consideration in the standard market design smd proceeding 
it focused in particular on the elements that must be in place for well functioning wholesale markets 
appendix a provided a comparison of order no 
s existing requirements for rtos with the proposed requirements of the wmp that would apply to rtos and independent system operators isos 
the commission committed to consider all comments on the white paper  as well as pending legislation  prior to the issuance of a final rule 
to date  the ferc has not issued a final rule in its smd proceeding 
among other things  the white paper set forth the ferc s assessment of how best to move forward in the electric industry and how the ferc intended to change its proposed rulemaking on the smd issued in based on concerns that were raised with respect to the proposed rule  stated the ferc s intent to eliminate the proposed requirement that public utilities create or join an independent transmission provider and  instead  to require public utilities to join an rto or an iso  called for phase in implementation and sequencing tailored to each region allowing for modifications to benefit customers within each region  indicated that the ferc would not require implementation of a feature of the market platform if the costs outweighed its benefits for a particular rto or iso  called for the inclusion of market power mitigation measures but not divestiture of vertically integrated utilities  and launched the commencement of technical conferences in the various regions 
the ferc s existing timetable for finalization requires that jurisdictional utilities must file open access transmission tariffs with any remaining revisions and be operating under the smd by september  other matters new accounting pronouncement fin in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r 
fin r provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities vies  previously known as special purpose entities or spes and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
certain disclosures are required if it is reasonably possible that a company will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when it initially applies fin r 
fin was required to be applied immediately to vies created or obtained after january  during  idacorp and ipc did not participate in the creation of  or obtain a new variable interest in  any vie 
for those vies created or obtained on or before january   idacorp and ipc must apply the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of idacorp and ipc are in the final stages of their analysis of fin r and the majority of their investments  principally ifs affordable housing investments are not expected to meet the criteria for consolidation included in fin r 
idacorp and ipc do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on their financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity though a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highlyrated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt net of temporary investments 
assuming no change in either company s financial structure  if variable interest rates were to average one percentage point higher than the average rate on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate  and therefore do not expose idacorp or ipc to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc is exposed to changes in commodity prices related to the purchases and sales of electricity as part of its ongoing utility operations 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a portion of the electric energy it is required to sell to its customers at fixed rates may be purchased at wholesale electric market prices  which can be higher than the fixed sales rate received 
ipc s exposure to this risk is offset to some extent by the previously discussed pca mechanism in place in idaho 
the objective of ipc s market price risk management program is to mitigate the risk associated with the purchase and sale of electricity  while balancing this risk against system reliability and cost considerations 
ipc has adopted a risk management policy to address commodity price risk 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
on a regular basis  the rmc reviews multiple system resource and load projections and evaluates the potential impacts of changes in four key variables wholesale prices  system loads  system resources and streamflow conditions 
the rmc controls the risk by assessing the impact of changes in the variables on power supply cost and projected volumetric surplus and deficit data  and by reviewing forward price curves for electricity and gas 
the rmc then orders an appropriate risk mitigating action 
actions may be undertaken only with creditworthy counterparties 
on august   due to the wind down of energy marketing  all utility related wholesale energy and gas transaction processes were returned to ipc 
these activities are focused on meeting system requirements and capitalizing on system related opportunities that can be risk managed 
energy trading the sale of ie s forward book of electricity trading contracts to set and the settlement of all gas trading contracts has eliminated the energy commodity price risk 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy  or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
energy as part of the sale of the forward book of electricity trading contracts  ie entered into an indemnity agreement with set  guaranteeing the performance of one of the counterparties 
the maximum amount payable by ie under the indemnity agreement is million 
the indemnity agreement has been accounted for in accordance with fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others and did not have a significant effect on the financial statements 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc  and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
