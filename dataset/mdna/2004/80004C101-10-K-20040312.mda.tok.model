overview sandisk was founded in to develop and market flash data storage systems 
we sell our products to the consumer electronics and industrial communications markets 
in  approximately of our product sales were attributable to the consumer electronics market  particularly sales of our compactflash  or cf card  secure digital  or sd card  minisd  memory stick  smartmedia and xd picture card products primarily in digital camera applications and cell phones 
substantial portions of our products are sold into the retail channel  which usually has shorter customer order lead times than our other channels 
a majority of our sales to the retail channel have immediate request dates  with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  thereby decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production needs and sales levels 
we believe sales to the consumer market will continue to represent a substantial majority of our sales  and may even increase as a percentage of our sales in future years 
there is an increasing popularity of consumer applications with flash memory  including digital cameras  portable digital music players  cell phones  cell phones that incorporate digital cameras  usb flash drives and pdas 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the volume of product sales  competitive pricing pressures  availability of foundry capacity from both captive and non captive sources  the timing and volume of sell through by our distributors and retail customers to their customers  variations in manufacturing cycle times  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization  the timing of significant orders  our ability to match supply with demand  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  the timing of license and royalty revenues  fluctuations in product costs  increased research and development expenses  and exchange rate fluctuations 
in the event we are required to increase purchases of flash memory products from non captive sources due to supply constraints on our captive sources  our product gross margins may be adversely impacted 
we have experienced seasonality in the past  and as the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics applications increases  our revenues may become increasingly subject to seasonal increases in the fourth quarter of each year with declines in the first quarter of the following year 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly and risks related to sales of our products there is seasonality in our business beginning in late  we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash technology  including our patent portfolio  to third party manufacturers of flash products 
to date  we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several companies  and intend to pursue opportunities to enter into additional licenses 
under our current license agreements  licensees pay license fees  royalties  or a combination thereof 
in some cases  the compensation to us may be partially in the form of guaranteed access to flash memory manufacturing capacity from the licensee company 
the timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
as a result  our license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues  gross margins and net income are 
table of contents likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues 
our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as certain of our existing license agreements expire or our licensees reach their royalty payment caps 
we market our products using our direct sales organization  distributors  manufacturers representatives  private label partners  oems and retailers 
in  and  retail sales accounted for  and of total product revenues  respectively 
we expect that sales through the retail channel will continue to comprise a significant portion of our product revenues in the future  and that a substantial portion of our sales into the retail channel will be made to participants that will have the right to return unsold products 
our policy is to defer recognition of revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the end customers 
in and  sales to the oem and industrial channels accounted for of total product revenues  compared to in however  total revenue dollars from our oem and industrial channels increased in  compared to historically  a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
sales to our top customers accounted for approximately  and  of our product revenues for  and  respectively 
in  and  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
however  seven of the top ten customers for were also part of our top ten customers in and we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by  any of our major customers  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to sales of our products sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues all of our flash memory products require silicon wafers for the memory components and the controller components  which are included in our flash card products 
the substantial majority of our memory wafers are currently manufactured for us by toshiba corporation s  or toshiba s  wafer facility at yokkaichi  japan  under our joint venture agreement 
additionally  in august  we entered into a seven year supply agreement with samsung electronics co  ltd  or samsung  which extended our existing relationship and allows us to purchase nand flash memory products from samsung s fabrication facilities in south korea 
our controller wafers are currently manufactured by umc and tower 
our business is subject to cyclical patterns as the demand versus supply equation is rarely in balance 
in times where supply outpaces demand  we have experienced significant declines in our average selling prices  as was the case in in times where demand outpaces supply  average selling prices decline more modestly  as was the case in the latter part of and throughout while the changes in average selling prices significantly impact our gross margins  we believe that declines in average selling prices allow for new markets or new applications for flash memory to be created 
it is our challenge to reduce our costs through greater efficiencies and in lower technology geometries  whereby our reduction in costs exceed the declines in average selling prices 
we anticipate in this environment that our gross margins may still be negatively impacted  however  the new markets and applications may allow for us to increase our revenue levels which in turn will increase our net income 
if industry wide demand for our products is below the industry wide available supply for prolonged periods  our product prices could decrease faster than our ability to reduce costs resulting in operating losses in the future 
under our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  flashvision  samsung  tower semiconductor ltd  or tower  and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining three months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of all of flashvision s wafer production 
this limits our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products 
if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders  which could result in lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable prices and or yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

table of contents excess inventory not only ties up our cash  but also can result in substantial losses if such inventory  or large portions thereof  has to be written down due to lower market pricing or product obsolescence 
we have from time to time taken write downs for excess or obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market price adjustments 
in for example  such write downs and lower of cost or market adjustments were approximately million 
we may be forced to take additional write downs for excess or obsolete inventory in future quarters if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders 
in addition  we may record additional lower of cost or market price adjustments to our inventories if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost 
these inventory adjustments decrease gross margins and in resulted in  and could in the future result in  fluctuations in gross margins and net earnings in the quarter in which they occur 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly export sales are an important part of our business  representing  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
our sales may be impacted by changes in economic or political conditions in our international markets 
economic conditions in our international markets  including japan  asia and the european union  may adversely affect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in these regions declines 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions  which could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our international operations and changes in securities laws and regulations because of our international operations  we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations for the foreseeable future  we expect to realize a significant portion of our revenues from recently introduced and new products 
typically  new products initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation 
in addition  manufacturing yields are generally lower at the start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry or at a new line width geometry 
in  and  we experienced start up costs of approximately million  million and million  respectively  associated with transition from one technology to another and with the ramping up nand wafer production at flashvision in and during the start up phase  the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers  making this output very expensive 
in the next two to three years  we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity at flashvision 
in february  we committed to loan flashvision up to approximately million to fund additional millimeter fabrication capacity through the end of this loan is secured by the equipment purchased by flashvision using the loan proceeds 
additional loans are expected to be made in several tranches through the first quarter of because our funding obligation is denominated in japanese yen  the amount of our obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
in december  we and toshiba announced our intention to  and are currently in discussions regarding  cooperating in the construction of a new millimeter wafer fabrication facility  fab  at toshiba s yokkaichi operations 
as under the current flashvision joint venture  we would be obligated to purchase half of fab s nand wafer production output 
toshiba would construct the fab building  depreciation of the fab building would be a component of the cost to each party of wafers produced by fab  and both parties would provide funds for the manufacturing equipment 
toshiba currently plans to begin construction of the building in the first half of we may agree that in the event that we and toshiba do not execute definitive agreements with respect to fab  we will reimburse toshiba for of certain start up costs and fab co 
formation costs incurred by toshiba and for cancellation fees due under authorized contractor and vendor invoices for orders placed by toshiba for certain equipment and construction materials for fab that toshiba cannot otherwise use  which amounts would be substantial 
the total investment in fab  excluding the cost of building construction  is currently estimated at billion through the end of  of which our share is estimated to be approximately billion  with initial production currently scheduled for the end of we and toshiba have not yet agreed to the terms of this potential new venture 
we and toshiba would share equally in the investment  and we may need to raise additional capital for our portion of the investment 
in addition to our initial investment in expansion at yokkaichi and in fab  
table of contents if a final agreement for fab is reached between us and toshiba  for several quarters we will incur substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel  facilitizing the clean room and installing equipment at the expanded fabrication facility and at fab should customer demand for nand flash products be less than our available supply  we may experience reduced revenues and increased expenses as well as increased inventory of unsold nand flash wafers  which could harm our operating results 
in addition we have not yet  and may never  enter into definitive agreements with toshiba with respect to the construction and operation of fab and even if we do not do so  we may remain obligated to reimburse toshiba for of the cancellation fees described above  which would be substantial 
to remain competitive  we are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs  including the development of future generations of nand flash memory 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop such products or processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs 
moreover in the event of an over supply of flash memory products  we may be unable to efficiently utilize the nand flash wafer production from flashvision  which would force us to amortize the fixed costs of the fabrication facility over a reduced wafer output  making these wafers significantly more expensive 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to vendors and subcontractors we and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of realization 
because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry  sales made to distributors and retailers are generally under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return and  therefore  the income on these sales is deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to the their end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and december   deferred income  from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated product returns are provided for and were not material for any period presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements 
we earn patent license revenue under patent cross license agreements with several companies including lexar media  inc  or lexar  renesas  samsung  sharp electronics corporation  or sharp  silicon storage technology  inc  or sst  smartdisk corporation  sony corporation  or sony  olympus  and tdk 
our current license agreements provide for the payment of license fees or royalties  or a combination thereof  to us 
the timing and amount of these payments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter  depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
revenue from patent licensing arrangements is recognized when earned 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by third parties 
for certain of our licensees  we estimate royalty revenues earned based on our licensees preliminary reports  and align actual reported royalty revenues when we receive the final reports 
we have received payments under our cross license agreements  portions of which were recognized as revenue and portions of which were 
table of contents recorded as deferred revenue 
our cross license arrangements  that include a guarantee of access to flash memory supply  were recorded based upon the cash received for the arrangement as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for the fair value of the intellectual property exchanged or supply guarantees received 
under these arrangements we have recorded the cash received as the total value of goods received and are recognizing the associated revenues over the life of the agreement  which corresponds to the life of the supply arrangement as well 
recognition of deferred revenue is expected to occur in future periods over the life of the agreements  as we meet certain obligations as provided in the various agreements 
at december  and december   deferred revenue from patent license agreements was million and million  respectively 
the cost of revenues associated with patent license and royalty revenues was insignificant for the three years ended december  we record reductions to revenue and trade accounts receivable for customer programs and incentive offerings  including promotions and other volume based incentives  when revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements 
marketing development programs  when granted  are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program 
these incentives generally apply only to our retail customers  which represented which represented  and of our product revenues in  and  respectively 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings to our retail customers  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due based on our historical experience 
all accounts or portions thereof that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off through a charge to the allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
warranty costs 
the majority of our products are warrantied for periods ranging from one to seven years 
a provision for the estimated future cost related to warranty expense is recorded and included in the cost of revenue when revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs differ adversely from our estimates  increases to our warranty liability would be required 
valuation of financial instruments 
our short term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
we also have equity investments in  umc of million and tower of million  as of december  in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost of these investments is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
in  no declines of an other than temporary nature were recorded for these marketable equity investments and a gain was recorded as an adjustment to the fair value of the tower warrant of approximately million as determined using a black scholes option pricing model at december  no adjustment was recorded related to an other than temporary decline of our equity investment  as there was an unrealized pre tax gain of approximately million recorded as a component of our accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
in  the market value of our investment in tower declined significantly 
as a result  we recognized losses totaling million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment  and an adjustment to the fair value of the warrant purchased during of million as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
if the fair value of the tower and umc investments decline further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
see note in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventories and inventory valuation 
we write down our inventory to a new basis for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  including assumptions about changes in average selling prices 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax assets 
at december   based on the weight of all available evidence  we carried no remaining valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets 
during we reversed a portion of the valuation allowance that benefited the current year s tax provision 
the remaining portion of the valuation allowance  primarily associated with unrealized capital loss on our investment and prior year stock option deductions  was recognized into the current year s accumulated other comprehensive income loss and stockholders equity 
at december   we had provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such an amount will not be realized 
results of operations we operate in one business segment  flash memory products 
our products are sold worldwide 
in the united states and foreign countries our products are sold through direct  oem  reseller  and distributor channels 
our chief decision maker  our president and chief executive officer  evaluates our performance based on total results 
revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and product category 
separate financial information is not available by product category with respect to asset allocation  expense allocation  or profitability 
product revenues 
in  our product revenues were million up from in the increase was primarily the result of higher unit volumes and higher average card capacities within our target markets 
the largest revenue generators for included sd card  cf card  memory stick and minisd card  which collectively represented an increase of in units sold 
while demand outpaced supply in the industry during fiscal  our average selling price per megabyte decreased approximately when compared to in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  our average selling prices per megabyte declined 
in  our product revenues were million  up million or from million in the increase in product revenues was primarily due of higher unit volumes and higher average card capacities within our target markets 
in fiscal  the largest unit volume and revenue increases came from our cf card  sd card  memory stick  and flashdisk products  compared to the prior year 
in  total flash memory units sold increased approximately compared to in  due to competitive pricing pressures  our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately when compared to in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  our average selling prices per megabyte declined 
our backlog as of december  was million  compared to million in this increase in backlog was primarily due to higher bookings in all markets 
since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellations  backlog is not necessarily an accurate indication of future revenue 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly and risks related to sales of our products there is seasonality in our business in fiscal and  oem industrial distribution sales represented of our product revenues  compared to in retail revenues  which are typically booked and shipped in the same quarter  were of our product revenues in both and  compared to in we expect sales to the retail channel to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in and beyond 
license and royalty revenues 
we currently earn patent license fees and royalties under several cross license agreements 
license and royalty revenues from patent cross license agreements were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in license and royalty 
table of contents revenues between and was primarily the result of increased royalty bearing sales during the year 
the decrease in license and royalty revenues between and was primarily due to lower patent royalties from lower royalty bearing sales by some of our licensees resulting in decreased patent license revenues recognized 
revenues from licenses and royalties were of total revenues in and  and in our revenue from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this revenue comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
gross profits losses 
in fiscal  gross profits increased million or representing an overall gross margin of for the year 
product gross margins were in up from in fiscal the increase in product gross margins and product gross profits was the result of the fairly stable pricing environment particularly in the second half of resulting from constrained supply and lower manufacturing costs  coupled with higher unit sales volumes which were partially offset by flashvision start up and tool relocation costs 
in addition  margins and profits were favorably impacted by the increase in units and megabytes sold in resulting in improved economies of scale 
our higher mix of more cost effective multi level cell  or mlc  chips along with our transition to 
micron technology in the second half of also favorably impacted our margins and gross profits 
in addition  during fiscal  we sold approximately million of inventory that had been fully written off in prior periods  which favorably impacted gross margins by less than for fiscal in fiscal  gross profits were million  or of total revenues compared to negative million  or negative of total revenues in product gross margins were in compared to a negative in the increase in product gross margin and gross profits in was due to a combination of factors  including relatively more stable pricing conditions within our industry in than in  lower production costs due to a higher mix of more cost effective mlc chips  significantly lower overhead expenses due to our restructuring activities in and improved economies of scale due to the growth in unit volumes across our major product lines 
in addition  we sold approximately million worth of nor inventory that had been fully written off as excess or obsolete in previous periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and development engineers  prototype supplies and contract services 
research and development expenses increased to million in up from million in and up from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in in  our absolute dollar increase in research and development was primarily due to million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses as overall headcount in this area increased from to for continuing product introductions and enhancements 
in  the absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with increased personnel 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  sales commissions  benefits and travel expenses for our sales  marketing  customer service and applications engineering personnel 
these expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such as independent manufacturer s representative commissions  advertising and tradeshow expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for was primarily due to increased salary and commission expenses as a result of increased revenues during the year 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in from  was due primarily to decreased co op advertising expenses of million  which as of the beginning of fiscal were offset against revenue per applicable accounting literature  partially offset by an increase in commissions of million related to higher product revenues 
if we had been required to retroactively apply the same accounting treatment of recording these co op advertising expenses as offsets to revenue per new accounting literature prior to our fiscal year  we estimate that selling and marketing expenses would have been reduced by approximately million for we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as sales of our products grow and as we continue to develop the retail channel and brand awareness for our products 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance  information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal and other administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in general and administration expenses is primarily the result of increased headcount resulting in higher total salaries and payroll related expenses of million  partially offset by lower legal and ip related expenses during the year of million 
the increase in from was due primarily to an increase in legal fees of million  increased payroll related expenses of million and an increase of million in allowance for doubtful accounts associated with higher trade accounts receivable balances from increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and of total revenues in and general and administrative expenses could increase in the future if we pursue litigation to defend our patent portfolio and grow our infrastructure to support our growth 
general and administrative expense may also increase as a result of on going efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of see factors that may affect future results risks related to our intellectual property we may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties restructuring charges 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a plan to transfer all of our card assembly and test manufacturing operations from our sunnyvale location to offshore subcontractors 
as a result we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of the charge included million of severance and employee related costs for a reduction in workforce of approximately personnel  equipment write off charges of million and lease commitments of million on a vacated warehouse facility 
as of january  we have subleased a portion of our warehouse building in san jose  california 
given the current real estate market conditions in the san jose area  we do not expect to be able to sublease the remainder of this building before the end of any sublease income will be offset against the balance of the lease commitment restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter of of the million restructuring charge  cash payments of million and million were paid in and respectively 
after writing off certain non cash charges related to abandoned excess equipment  accruals of million remain as of december   related to amounts to be paid out for excess facility lease charges  net of facility sub lease income  over the respective lease terms 
the following table summarizes our restructuring activities from the inception of our plan through the end of workforce lease equipment reduction commitments total in thousands restructuring charge non cash charges cash payments accrual balance  december  non cash charges adjustments cash payments accrual balance  december  non cash charges adjustments cash payments accrual balance  december  equity in income of joint venture 
in  and  equity in income of joint ventures was million  million and million and included our share of net income from our flashvision joint venture and losses from our digital portal inc  or dpi  joint venture 
under the equity method of accounting  
table of contents our share of losses were deducted from our dpi investment account and therefore  as of december  there was no value related to dpi on our consolidated balance sheet 
our dpi investment was sold in december with minimal gain realized 
interest income expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the slight increase in interest income was due to higher average cash balances during over in september  we completed a follow on public offering raising over million in cash 
in addition  during we generated over million in cash from operating activities 
lower average interest rates over the course of the year offset our higher average cash balances 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily due to reductions in market interest rates 
in  we expect interest expense to be consistent with and interest income to increase slightly as compared to as a result of a full year of increased cash balances related to our secondary offering and cash from operating activities 
gain loss on investment in foundries 
in  we sold million shares of umc stock  recognized a gain of approximately million and recorded a million increase in fair value our tower warrant as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
during  we recognized a write down of million related to the recoverability of our tower prepaid wafer credits  which at december  were valued at million 
we periodically assess the value of the warrant  our tower ordinary shares and our prepaid wafer credits and adjust the value as necessary 
in future periods  if we sell shares that we own in either umc or tower  we may recognize a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of these stocks 
during  the value of our tower investment and wafer credits had declined to million 
losses totaling million  or million net of tax  were recorded in  comprised of a million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment  a million adjustment to the fair value of the warrant purchased during as determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and a million write down in the value of wafer credits 
at december   the value of our tower investment and wafer credits had declined to million 
we recorded an other than temporary loss of million  which included the write off of wafer credits received in in addition  we recorded a loss of million on our exchange of of our tower wafer credits for  tower ordinary shares at per share 
these losses totaled million  or million net of tax benefit in in both and  tower losses were recorded in loss on investment in foundry 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in  we determined that our investment in umc had sustained a substantial decline in its value as defined by generally accepted accounting principles 
the value of our investment in umc had declined to million at december  we recorded a loss of million on our umc investment in  or million net of taxes 
at december   the market value of the available for sale portion of our umc investment had declined million  before tax  below its adjusted cost of million  and this unrealized loss of approximately million was included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet as this unrealized loss was deemed to be temporary 
if the fair value of our umc investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  if our umc shares are sold  there may be a gain or loss  due to fluctuations in the market value of umc s stock 
loss on unauthorized sale of umc shares 
on october   we were advised by our taiwan law firm that umc shares owned by us and held in custody by our taiwan law firm  lee and li  had been embezzled by an employee of lee and li 
based on information provided by lee and li  a total of approximately million of our umc shares were sold in unauthorized transactions starting on august  and ending on september  as a result of the unauthorized sales of umc shares and our sale of million umc shares  our current holdings in umc decreased to approximately million shares 
accordingly  we recognized a loss of approximately million in accordance with sfas no 
related to the stolen shares and recognized a gain of million related to the sale of the million shares in our consolidated statements of income for pursuant to a settlement and general release agreement  or settlement agreement  entered into between us  
table of contents lee and li and certain lee and li personnel  the cash payment received by us of million on november   as well as  promises to pay  exclusive of interest  of million over four years have been classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a short term other receivable of million and a long term other receivable of million at december  the promises to pay are secured by irrevocable standby letters of credit 
we believe the credit for future professional services and payments of future charitable contributions on our behalf in the amount of million payable over years  which are an element of our settlement agreement  have no value  as there is no reasonable assurance of realization 
accordingly  we have charged to earnings these amounts as a loss on unauthorized sale of umc shares 
related to the recorded loss  we recognized a tax benefit in the third quarter of approximately million  and we also recognized a charge to our tax provision of approximately million resulting from the reversal of a tax benefit recognized in prior periods associated with the stolen umc shares 
if we realize any additional recovery  a gain will be realized in the period of recovery 
gain loss on equity investment 
during  our investment in divio was sold to ess technology 
the net result of this sale was a net realized loss of approximately million 
in  we recognized an impairment charge on the decline in the value of our investment in divio of million  or million net of tax  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net was million in compared to million in and million in the losses in  and were primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses on our yen denominated assets 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective tax provision rate was approximately  while our and effective tax provision benefit rates were approximately and  respectively 
our tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  a non cash reversal of the tax benefit we recognized in and related to the unrealized gain in our umc shares that were subsequently both voluntarily and fraudulently sold in  and to the benefit provided by our reversal of approximately million of the valuation allowance we carried against certain net deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal our tax rate was significantly lower than the statutory rate due to the utilization of previously unbenefited net operating losses and a reduction of the valuation allowance due to the increase in the unrealized gain on our investment in umc 
our future tax rate may be impacted by state taxes  and our ability to realize certain capital losses and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows at december   we had working capital of billion  which included million in cash and cash equivalents and million in unrestricted short term investments  excluding our investments in umc and tower 
operating activities for provided million of cash  primarily due to net income of million  plus non cash charges  primarily depreciation and amortization of million  loss on unauthorized sale of umc shares of million  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers and deferred revenue  a million increase in liabilities due to related parties  a million increase in income taxes payable and an increase in accrued payroll and related expenses of million 
these were partially offset by increases of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory  million in deposits and other current assets and an increase of million in our investment in flashvision 
cash provided by operations was million in  and cash used by operations was million in net cash used in investing activities was million in purchases  net of proceeds from short term investments of million  million of capital equipment and technology license purchases and million paid to tower for the fifth milestone payment during fiscal were partially offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of our million divio  inc shares  and proceeds of million 
table of contents from the sale of million of our umc shares 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and net cash provided in investing activities was million in net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our september follow on offering  and million from the sale of common stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in and million in depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in assembly and test manufacturing equipment or wafer fabrication foundry capacity to support our business in the future 
we may also invest in or acquire other companies product lines or assets 
our operating expenses may increase as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities  including our collaboration with toshiba for the joint development of nanometer and nanometer nand flash memory 
we plan to fund our short term operations from our current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
we are currently in discussions with toshiba regarding cooperating in the construction of a new millimeter wafer fabrication facility  fab  at toshiba s yokkaichi operations 
the total investment in fab  excluding the cost of building construction  is currently estimated at billion through the end of  of which our share is estimated to be approximately billion  with initial production currently scheduled for the end of we and toshiba have not yet agreed to the terms of this potential new venture 
we and toshiba will share equally in the investment  and we may need to raise additional capital for our portion of the investment 
however  if demand for our products declines and we are required to purchase more wafers than we need due to our flashvison joint venture commitments and our other supply arrangements  we may not be able to generate enough cash from our operations and will have to rely solely on our current cash and short term investment balances to fund our operating activities 
convertible subordinated notes on december   we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes due  or notes  and on january   the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option to purchase an additional million of notes  for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million  the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each on may and november the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain events 
at anytime on or after november   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a specified percentage of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
investment in umc in january  the usic foundry was merged into its umc parent company 
in exchange for our usic shares  we received million umc shares 
all of the umc shares we received as a result of the merger were subject to trading restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange 
as of january  all trading restrictions have been released on the shares currently held by us 
we also received million  million  million and million shares as stock dividends from umc in   and  respectively 
during the third quarter of  we sold million of our umc shares for gross proceeds of approximately million 
also during the third quarter  we suffered a loss of million as a 
table of contents result of the fraudulent sale and misappropriation of proceeds of million umc shares owned by us 
as a result of the unauthorized sales of umc shares and our sale of million umc shares  our current holdings in umc decreased to approximately million shares 
accordingly  we have reduced our umc investment in foundries as shown in the consolidated balance sheet to million at december  in addition  we recognized a loss of approximately million in accordance with sfas no 
related to the stolen shares and recognized a gain of million related to the sale of the million shares in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into between us  lee and li and certain lee and li personnel  we received a cash payment of million on november   as well as  promises to pay  exclusive of interest  of million over four years 
the promises to pay have been classified on our consolidated balance sheet as a short term other current asset of million and a long term other asset of million at december  the promises to pay are secured by irrevocable standby letters of credit 
we believe the credit for future professional services and payments of future charitable contributions on our behalf in the amount of million payable over years  which are an element of our settlement agreement  have no value  as there is no reasonable assurance of realization 
accordingly  we have charged to earnings these amounts as a loss on unauthorized sale of umc shares 
related to the recorded loss  we recognized a tax benefit in the third quarter of approximately million  and we also recognized a charge to our tax provision of approximately million resulting from the reversal of a tax benefit recognized in prior periods associated with the stolen umc shares 
if we realize any additional recovery  a gain will be realized in the period of recovery 
umc s share price increased to new taiwan dollars  or nt  of nt at december   from a stock dividend adjusted price of nt at december  as a result  our remaining investment  which is classified as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
includes an unrealized gain of approximately million  inclusive of related tax expense of million  recorded as a component of accumulated comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the fair value of the remaining million umc shares declines in the future and such declines are deemed to be other than temporary  it may be necessary to record losses on these declines 
in addition  in future periods  there may be a gain or loss if the umc shares are sold  due to fluctuations in the market value of umc s stock 
investment in flashvision joint venture in june  we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of megabit  gigabit and gigabit flash memory chips and secure digital card controllers 
as part of this transaction  we and toshiba formed flashvision  a joint venture  to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at toshiba s dominion semiconductor facility in manassas  virginia 
in april  we and toshiba consolidated flashvision s advanced nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at toshiba s memory fabrication facility in yokkaichi  japan 
in march  flashvision exercised its right of early termination under its lease facility with abn amro bank  nv and in april repaid all amounts outstanding 
flashvision secured an equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed in may with mizuho and other financial institutions 
under the terms of this lease  toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 
the terms of the flashvision joint venture contractually obligate us to purchase half of flashvision s nand wafer production output 
we also have the ability to purchase additional capacity under a foundry arrangement with toshiba 
under the terms of our foundry agreement with toshiba  we must provide toshiba 
table of contents with a purchase order commitment based on a six month rolling forecast 
the purchase orders placed under this arrangement relating to the first three months of the six month forecast are binding  at market prices and cannot be cancelled 
at december   approximately million of non cancelable purchase orders for flash memory wafers from toshiba and flashvision were outstanding 
in addition  as a part of the joint venture agreement  we are required to fund certain research and development expenses related to the development of advanced nand flash memory technologies 
as of december   we had accrued liabilities related to those expenses of million 
the common research and development amount is a variable computation with certain payment caps 
future obligations are to be paid in installments using a percentage of our revenue from nand flash products built with flash memory supplied by toshiba or flashvision 
the direct research and development is a pre determined amount that extends through the third quarter of subsequent to the third quarter of  direct research and development liabilities will be computed using a variable percentage of actual research and development expenses incurred 
given the current apparent acceleration in global demand for flash memory wafers and assuming that the markets for our products continue their current growth  new anticipated demand from customers may outstrip the supply of flash memory wafers available to us from all of our current sources 
in that case  we may need to secure substantial additional flash memory wafer fabrication capacity at 
micron and finer line lithography 
accordingly  we and toshiba are currently discussing various fabrication and test capacity expansion plans for the flashvision operation in yokkaichi  japan 
we and toshiba plan to substantially expand and increase yokkaichi s mm flash memory wafer output in and the capacity expansion will be partially funded through flashvision internally generated funds  as well as through substantial additional investments by toshiba and sandisk 
in february  we committed to loan flashvision up to approximately million to fund additional millimeter fabrication capacity through the end of fiscal this loan is secured by the equipment purchased by flashvision using the loan proceeds 
additional loans are expected to be made in several tranches through the first quarter of because our funding obligation is denominated in japanese yen  the amount of our obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
in december  we and toshiba announced our intention to  and are currently in discussions regarding  cooperating in the construction of a new millimeter wafer fabrication facility  fab  at toshiba s yokkaichi operations 
as under the current flashvision joint venture  we would be obligated to purchase half of fab s nand wafer production output 
toshiba would construct the fab building  depreciation of the fab building would be a component of the cost to each party of wafers produced by fab  and both parties would provide funds for the manufacturing equipment 
toshiba currently plans to begin construction of the building in the first half of we may agree that in the event that we and toshiba do not execute definitive agreements with respect to fab  we will reimburse toshiba for of certain start up costs and fab co 
formation costs incurred by toshiba and for cancellation fees due under authorized contractor and vendor invoices for orders placed by toshiba for certain equipment and construction materials for fab that toshiba cannot otherwise use  which amounts would be substantial 
the total investment in fab  excluding the cost of building construction  is currently estimated at billion through the end of  of which our share is estimated to be approximately billion  with initial production currently scheduled for the end of we and toshiba would share equally in the investment  and we may need to raise additional capital for our portion of the investment 
in addition to our initial investment in expansion at yokkaichi and in fab  if a final agreement for fab is reached between us and toshiba  for several quarters we will incur substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel  facilitizing the clean room and installing equipment at the expanded fabrication facility and at fab investment in tower in july  we entered into a share purchase agreement to make an aggregate million investment in tower semiconductor for tower s new foundry facility  fab  in five installments upon tower s completion of specific milestones 
as of december   we had invested million in tower and obtained  tower ordinary shares  million of prepaid wafer credits  and a warrant to purchase  
table of contents tower ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires on october  the  tower ordinary shares represented an approximate equity ownership position in tower as of december  in fiscal we recorded write downs to the value of the wafer credits of million and utilized approximately million of these wafer credits to purchase controller wafers from tower 
also in  we recorded a million gain to adjust the book value of the warrant and as of december   we had recognized cumulative losses of approximately million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in tower ordinary shares  million as a result of the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and million of losses on our warrant to purchase tower ordinary shares 
as of december   our tower ordinary shares were valued at million and included an unrealized gain of million  inclusive of related tax expense impact of million  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  our tower prepaid wafer credits were valued at million and the warrant to purchase tower ordinary shares was valued at million 
in february  we agreed to amend our foundry investment agreements with tower and advance the payment of million for the fifth and final milestone in two installments  a first installment of approximately million and a second installment of approximately million  regardless of whether the milestone was met 
tower s shareholders approved the amendment in may in november  we agreed to further amend the foundry investment agreements  referred to as the november amendment  to  among other things  a advance the entirety of the remaining fifth milestone payment of  or payment  b defer our use of wafer credits  and c extend the lock up period on our tower ordinary shares 
the november amendment was approved by tower s shareholders in december  following which approval we made the payment 
we received  tower ordinary shares at the time we made the payment and  tower ordinary shares in january upon the closing of tower s follow on public offering  which generated net cash to tower of approximately million and correspondingly reduced our equity ownership position 
also under the november amendment  we agreed not to use wafer credits until january   except with respect to purchase orders issued before the date of the november amendment utilizing wafer credits  however  we will have the option to convert credits we would have otherwise been able to utilize per quarter into tower ordinary shares at the day average trading price of tower shares  or atp  preceding the last day of the relevant quarter 
unconverted credits shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to three month libor plus through december  interest payments will be made quarterly and the aggregate principal amount of the unconverted credits will be repaid in one lump sum on december  effective as of december   we may convert all of the then remaining series a credits into tower ordinary shares at the day atp preceding december  if the number of tower ordinary shares received by us and the other wafer partners as a result of this conversion is greater than or equal to an aggregate of of tower s issued and outstanding share capital on january   tower will transact a rights offering for the distribution of rights to all of tower s shareholders  other than us and the other wafer partners but including israel corporation technologies  at the same day atp 
the november amendment also provides that we will not sell our tower ordinary shares until january   except we may sell of the tower shares held as of january  in addition  we have extended the date on which we may exercise our demand registration rights until the earlier of i december  and ii such date that tower has fulfilled all of its obligations to raise any additional financing pursuant to its facility agreement 
other equity investments in november  we made a strategic investment of million in divio  inc  or divio 
in  we accounted for this investment under the cost method  and we recorded a decline in the fair value of the investment of million 
at december   the value of our divio investment had declined to million 
during fiscal  divio was sold to ess technology resulting in a net loss from this sale for fiscal of million 

table of contents on august   we entered into a joint venture  digital portal inc  or dpi  with photo me inc  or pmi  for the manufacture  installation  marketing  and maintenance of self service  digital photo printing labs  or kiosks  bearing the sandisk brand name in locations in the united states and canada 
under the agreement  we invested million 
in an agreement effective september   we and pmi agreed that we would scale down our kiosk activities and pmi would assume responsibility to finance and direct the future growth of dpi 
under the agreement  we converted approximately  in receivables due from dpi to equity in dpi  reduced our ownership percentage below and gave up our seat on the dpi board of directors 
under the new agreement  we discontinued our kiosk related activities  are no longer required to make additional equity investments in dpi  guarantee dpi s equipment leases or otherwise pay any of dpi s expenses  and furthermore  dpi will no longer use the sandisk brand name 
we have accounted for this investment under the equity method  and in we recorded a million loss as our share of dpi s losses  which was deducted from the investment account 
as of december   this investment had been sold and the related gain on the sale was minimal

table of contents in june  we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of megabit  gigabit and gigabit flash memory chips and secure digital card controllers 
as part of this transaction  we and toshiba formed flashvision  a joint venture  to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at toshiba s dominion semiconductor facility in manassas  virginia 
in april  we and toshiba restructured our flashvision joint venture by consolidating flashvision s advanced nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at toshiba s memory fabrication facility in yokkaichi  japan 
under the terms of the agreement  toshiba transferred the flashvision owned and leased nand production tool set from dominion to yokkaichi and undertook full responsibility for the equipment transfer and production set up 
the flashvision operation at yokkaichi continues the joint venture on essentially the same terms as the parties had at toshiba s facility in virginia 
in march  flashvision exercised its right of early termination under its lease facility with abn amro bank  nv and in april repaid all amounts outstanding 
flashvision secured an equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed in may with mizuho and other financial institutions 
under the terms of this lease  toshiba guaranteed these commitments on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
in february  we committed to loan flashvision up to approximately million to fund additional millimeter fabrication capacity through the end of fiscal this loan is secured by the equipment purchased by flashvision using the loan proceeds 
additional loans are expected to be made in several tranches through the first quarter of because our funding obligation is denominated in japanese yen  the amount of our obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
impact of currency exchange rates a portion of our revenues is denominated in japanese yen 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   there were no forward contracts outstanding 
future exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties  including the equity holders 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the unmodified provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities in practice and under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  
table of contents among the scope exceptions  companies are not required to apply fin r to an entity that meets the criteria to be considered a business as defined in the interpretation unless one or more of four named conditions exist 
fin r applies immediately to a vie created or acquired after january  we have reviewed our investment portfolio to determine whether any of our equity investments are considered variable interest entities 
we did not identify any variable interest entities that must be consolidated  but have made any required additional disclosures 
the maximum exposure of any investment that may be determined to be in a variable interest entity is limited to the amount invested 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
applied to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our operations and our stock price 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors  including the following unpredictable or changing demand for our products  decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressures  timing of sell through by our distributors and retail customers  seasonality in sales of our products  natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  where our principal source of flash memory wafers is located  as well as taiwan  south korea  china and the united states  reduced sales to our customers or interruption to our manufacturing processes in the pacific rim that may arise from regional issues in asia  availability of sufficient flash memory wafer foundry capacity to meet customer demand  increased purchases of flash memory products from non captive sources  difficulty of forecasting and managing inventory levels  particularly  building a large inventory of unsold product due to non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase materials such as flash memory wafers  controllers  printed circuit boards and discrete components  write offs related to obsolescence or devaluation of unsold inventory  
table of contents write downs of our investments in fabrication capacity  other fixed assets  equity investments and prepaid wafer credits  adverse changes in product and customer mix  slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  such as the minisd card targeted at advanced cell phones and the cruzer mini  a usb hi speed flash drive  increased sales by our competitors  competing flash memory device standards  which displace the standards used in our products  changes in our distribution channels  fluctuations in our license and royalty revenue  fluctuations in product costs  particularly due to fluctuations in manufacturing yields and utilization of new technologies  excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own flash wafer capacity  which may cause a rapid decline in our average selling prices  shortages of components such as capacitors  lids and printed circuit boards required for the manufacture of our products  significant or unexpected yield losses  which could affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and could increase our costs  manufacturing flaws affecting the reliability  functionality or performance of our products  which could increase our product costs  reduce demand for our products or require costly product recalls  increased research and development expenses  exchange rate fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar and japanese yen  changes in general economic conditions  and reduced sales to our retail customers if consumer confidence declines 
we depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers and any shortage or disruption in our supply from these sources will reduce our revenues  earnings and gross margins 
all of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers for the memory components and the controller components  which are included in our flash cards 
the substantial majority of our memory wafers are currently supplied by toshiba s wafer facility at yokkaichi  japan  as well as by umc in taiwan and to a lesser extent by renesas and samsung 
our controller wafers are currently manufactured by umc and tower 
given the recent increase in global demand for flash memory wafers and assuming that the markets for our products continue their current growth rate  new anticipated demand from customers may outstrip the supply of flash memory wafers available to us from our current sources 
if toshiba  flashvision  samsung  tower and umc are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy these requirements  our business  financial condition and operating results may suffer 
any disruption in supply from these sources due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
difficulty of estimating future wafer requirements may cause us to overestimate our requirements and build excess inventories  or underestimate our requirements and have a shortage of wafers  either of which will harm our financial results 
under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with flashvision  renesas  samsung  toshiba  tower and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments and the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of flashvision s wafer production 
this limits our 
table of contents ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
for example  if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of silicon wafers and other flash memory products to fill customer orders  which could result in dissatisfied customers  lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of silicon wafers or other flash memory products with acceptable price and or yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
because the majority of our products are sold into emerging consumer markets  it has been  and likely will continue to be  difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
in addition  bookings visibility remains limited because a substantial majority of our quarterly sales are currently  have historically been  and we expect will continue to be  from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  which makes accurate forecasting very difficult 
our product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
variability of expense levels and significant fixed costs will harm our business if our revenues do not exceed our operating expenses 
we may need to hire additional personnel or otherwise increase our operating expenses in the future to support our sales and marketing efforts  research and development  and general and administrative activities 
we have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce these expenses over the short term 
if our revenues do not increase proportionately to our operating expenses  or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a particular period  we may not be able to reduce our expenses in the short term  or at all  and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
license fees and royalties from our patent cross license agreements are variable and fluctuate from period to period making it difficult to predict our royalty revenues 
our intellectual property strategy consists of cross licensing our patents to other manufacturers of flash memory products 
under these arrangements  we earn license fees and royalties on individually negotiated terms 
our revenue from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this revenue comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
the timing of revenue recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by our licensees 
as a result  our license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues  gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues 
our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as our existing license agreements expire  caps are reached or rates change 
we may be unable to maintain market share  which would reduce our potential revenues and benefit our competitors 
during periods of excess supply in the market for our flash memory products  we may lose market share to competitors who aggressively lower their prices 
conversely  under conditions of tight flash memory supply  we may be unable to increase our production volumes at a sufficiently rapid rate so as to maintain our market share 
the market for flash memory products is currently undergoing a period of tight supply  but we cannot predict if this condition will continue and  if it does  for how long 
ultimately  our future growth rate depends on our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to meet demand 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner  we may lose market share to our competitors 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  severe price competition for our products  which adversely impacts our product gross margins and overall profitability 
in addition  we provide many of our retail customers protection against declines in the selling price of inventory that they have purchased from us but have not yet sold to end users 
in times when prices are falling  this price protection obligation may have a significant adverse effect on our gross margins 
in competing for market share  we face large corporations that have well established brand identity and significant strengths in our sales channels 

table of contents future rapid growth may strain our operations 
we must continue to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees to achieve future growth 
in the past  we have from time to time experienced difficulty hiring the necessary engineering  sales and marketing personnel to support our growth 
in addition  we must make a significant investment in our information management systems to support increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth in the future  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on key personnel  including our executive officers  the loss of whom could disrupt our business 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development  sales  marketing and operations personnel  including dr 
eli harari  our founder  president and chief executive officer 
we do not maintain employment agreements with our executive officers 
our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such key personnel  or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us 
we may make acquisitions that are dilutive to existing stockholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations  and result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies or businesses 
we may grow our business through business combinations or other acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
we continually evaluate and explore strategic opportunities as they arise  including business combinations  strategic partnerships  capital investments and the purchase  licensing or sale of assets 
if we issue equity securities in connection with an acquisition  the issuance may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
alternatively  acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash would reduce our cash reserves 
acquisitions may require significant capital infusions  typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of acquired companies 
we may experience delays in the timing and successful integration of acquired technologies and product development through volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also result in our entering into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
furthermore  acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  the amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill  any of which could negatively impact our results of operations 
any of these events could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions we do undertake 

table of contents risks related to the development of new products in transitioning to new processes and products  we face production and market acceptance risks that have caused  and may in the future cause  significant product delays that could harm our business 
successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity per chip 
two important factors have enabled us to decrease the cost per megabyte of our flash data storage products the development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of smaller geometry manufacturing processes 
the transition to new feature sizes is highly complex and requires new controllers  new test procedures and modifications of numerous other aspects of manufacturing  as well as extensive qualification of the new products by both us and our oem customers 
any material delay in a qualification schedule could delay deliveries and adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  a number of challenges exist in achieving a lower cost per megabyte  including lower yields often experienced in the early production of new semiconductor devices  manufacturing flaws with new processes including manufacturing processes at our subcontractors which may be extremely complex  problems with the design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate these devices  which may result in delays or product recalls  and production delays 
because our products are complex  we periodically experience significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products 
similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we  along with our flash memory wafer sources  will successfully develop and bring into full production with acceptable yields and reliability these new products  processes or the underlying technology  or that any development or production ramp up will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner 
if we are not successful or if our cost structure is not competitive  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
new products based on nand mlc flash technology may encounter production delays and problems impacting production reliability and yields  which may cause our revenues and gross margins to decline 
we have developed new products based on nand mlc flash technology  a flash architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell 
high density flash memory  such as nand mlc flash  is a complex technology that requires strict manufacturing controls and effective test screens 
problems encountered in the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability and yields  and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product availability 
we may not be able to manufacture future generations of nand mlc products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte 
if we are unable to bring future generations of high density flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience unplanned yield or reliability problems  our revenues and gross margins will decline 
we continually seek to develop new products and standards  which may not be widely adopted by consumers or  if adopted  may reduce demand by consumers for our older products  which if not offset by increased demand for the new products could harm our results of operations 
we continually seek to develop new products and standards and enhance existing products and standards developed solely by us  as well as jointly with our strategic partners such as toshiba  matsushita and sony 
for example  in march  our joint development efforts with toshiba and matsushita  together with contribution by the secure digital association  or sd association  resulted in the introduction of the minisd card  a smaller version of the sd card 
in addition  we and sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation memory stick  the memorystick pro  which each of us has the right to manufacture and sell 
as we introduce new standards and new products  such as the minisd card  the memorystick pro and the usb cruzer and cruzer mini  it will take time for these new standards and products to be adopted  for consumers to accept and transition to these new products and for significant sales 
table of contents to be generated from them  if this happens at all 
moreover  broad acceptance of new standards or products by consumers may reduce demand for our older products 
if this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for our new products  our results of operations could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that any new products or standards we develop will be commercially successful 
see the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products 
the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products 
in order for demand for our products to grow  the markets for new devices that use our flash memory products  such as digital cameras  cellular phones that incorporate digital cameras  portable digital music players  usb flash drives and pdas  must develop and grow 
if sales of these products do not grow  our revenues and profit margins could be adversely impacted 
the success of our new product strategy will depend  among other factors  upon the following our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte  the development of new applications or markets for our flash data storage products  the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their products and successfully introduce their products  the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others  and the adoption by the major content providers of the copy protection features offered by our sd card products 
risks related to our flashvision joint venture our flashvision joint venture with toshiba makes us vulnerable to risks  including potential inventory write offs  disruptions or shortages of supply  limited ability to react to fluctuations in product demand  direct competition with toshiba  and a significant contingent indemnification obligation  any of which could substantially harm our business and financial condition 
we and toshiba plan to continue to expand the wafer fabrication capacity of our flashvision business in japan and as we do so  we will make substantial capital investments and incur substantial start up and tool relocation costs  which could adversely impact our operating results 
in june  we  along with toshiba  formed flashvision for the joint development and manufacture of several flash memory products  including megabit  gigabit  gigabit and other advanced flash memory products 
we and toshiba each separately market and sell these products 
accordingly  we compete directly with toshiba for sales of products incorporating these jointly developed and manufactured products 
in addition  we and toshiba plan to make substantial investments in new capital assets from time to time to expand the wafer fabrication capacity of our flashvision business in japan 
each time that we and toshiba add substantial new wafer fabrication capacity  we will experience significant start up costs as a result of the delay between the time of the investment and the time qualified products are manufactured and sold in volume quantities 
we will incur start up costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the expanded output 
given the current apparent acceleration in global demand for flash memory wafers and assuming that the markets for our products continue their current growth  new anticipated demand from customers may outstrip the supply of flash memory wafers available to us from all of our current sources 
in that case  we may need to secure substantial additional flash memory wafer fabrication capacity at 
micron and finer line lithography 
accordingly  we and toshiba are currently discussing various fabrication and test capacity expansion plans for the flashvision operation in yokkaichi  japan 
we and toshiba plan to substantially expand and increase yokkaichi s mm flash memory wafer output in and the capacity expansion will be partially funded through flashvision internally generated funds  as well as through substantial additional investments by toshiba and sandisk 
in february  we committed 
table of contents to loan flashvision up to approximately million to fund additional millimeter fabrication capacity through the end of fiscal this loan is secured by the equipment purchased by flashvision using the loan proceeds 
additional loans are expected to be made in several tranches through the first quarter of because our funding obligation is denominated in japanese yen  the amount of our obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
in december  we and toshiba announced our intention to  and are currently in discussions regarding  cooperating in the construction of a new millimeter wafer fabrication facility  fab  at toshiba s yokkaichi operations 
as under the current flashvision joint venture  we would be obligated to purchase half of fab s nand wafer production output 
toshiba would construct the fab building  depreciation of the fab building would be a component of the cost to each party of wafers produced by fab  and both parties would provide funds for the manufacturing equipment 
toshiba currently plans to begin construction of the building in the first half of we may agree that in the event that we and toshiba do not execute definitive agreements with respect to fab  we will reimburse toshiba for of certain start up costs and fab co 
formation costs incurred by toshiba and for cancellation fees due under authorized contractor and vendor invoices for orders placed by toshiba for certain equipment and construction materials for fab that toshiba cannot otherwise use  which amounts would be substantial 
the total investment in fab  excluding the cost of building construction  is currently estimated at billion through the end of  of which our share is estimated to be approximately billion  with initial production currently scheduled for the end of we and toshiba would share equally in the investment  and we may need to raise additional capital for our portion of the investment 
in addition to our initial investment in expansion at yokkaichi and in fab  if a final agreement for fab is reached between us and toshiba  for several quarters we will incur substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel  facilitizing the clean room and installing equipment at the expanded fabrication facility and at fab in addition  we may not achieve the expected cost benefits of the expansion or a new facility for several quarters  if at all 
we will incur start up costs and pay ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize the new output 
should customer demand for nand flash products be less than our available supply  we may experience reduced revenues and increased expenses as well as increased inventory of unsold nand flash wafers  which could harm our operating results 
in addition we have not yet  and may never  enter into definitive agreements with toshiba with respect to the construction and operation of fab and even if we do not do so  we may remain obligated to reimburse toshiba for of the costs and cancellation fees described above  which would be substantial 
we face challenges and possible delays relating to the conversion of our production to micron and smaller feature sizes  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we were using the production capacity at toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facilities to manufacture nand flash memory wafers with minimum lithographic feature size of micron and recently converted to micron technology 
we have not yet completed qualification of some new micron product components 
any material delay in our qualification schedule will delay deliveries and adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  we plan to manufacture flash memory wafers with even smaller lithographic feature sizes 
our minimum feature sizes are considered today to be among the most advanced for mass production of flash memory wafers 
therefore  it is difficult to predict how long it will take to achieve adequate yields  reliable operation  and economically attractive product costs based on our new designs and feature sizes 
we currently rely and will continue to rely on toshiba to address these challenges 
with our investments in the flashvision joint venture at toshiba s yokkaichi facilities  we are now and will continue to be exposed to the adverse financial impact of any delays or manufacturing problems associated with wafer production lines 
any problems or delays in volume production at the yokkaichi fabrication facilities could adversely impact our operating results in and beyond 
toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facilities are a significant source of supply of flash memory wafers and any disruption in this supply will reduce our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
although we buy flash memory from the flashvision joint venture  we also rely on toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facilities to supply on a foundry basis a portion of our flash memory wafers 
even if flashvision 
table of contents successfully produces quantities at planned levels  the yokkaichi fabrication facilities may not produce quantities of wafers with acceptable prices  reliability and yields to satisfy our needs 
any failure in this regard may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  as our right to purchase flash memory products from samsung and others is limited and may not be sufficient to replace any shortfall in production at the yokkaichi facilities 
in addition  because a substantial majority of our wafers are produced at the yokkaichi facilities  any disruption in supply from the yokkaichi facilities due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in the second quarter of  an earthquake in northern japan disrupted operations at another toshiba fabrication line for several weeks 
although no damage or disruption was reported at yokkaichi  the occurrence and effects of these events is unpredictable and could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we rely on the existing manufacturing organizations at the yokkaichi facilities 
if toshiba and flashvision are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy our wafer supply requirements  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
our obligations under our wafer supply agreements with toshiba and flashvision  or decreased demand for our products  may result in excess inventories and lead to inventory write offs  and any technical difficulties or manufacturing problems may result in shortages in supply  either of which would adversely affect our business 
under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  we are obligated to purchase half of flashvision s wafer production output and we will also purchase wafers from toshiba s current yokkaichi fabrication facilities on a foundry relationship basis 
under the terms of our foundry relationship with toshiba and wafer supply agreements with flashvision  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders  which are difficult to estimate 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments and cannot be cancelled and the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
if we are unable for any reason to achieve customer acceptance of our card products built with these flash chips or if demand decreases  we will experience a significant increase in our inventory  which may result in inventory write offs and otherwise harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we place purchase orders with toshiba and our business condition deteriorates  we could experience reduced revenues  increased expenses  and increased inventory of unsold flash wafers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  in order for us to sell our products  we have been developing  and will continue to develop  new controllers  printed circuit boards and test algorithms 
any technical difficulties or delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available flash memory output and could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a contingent indemnification obligation for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
flashvision secured an equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed in may with mizuho corporate bank  ltd  and other financial institutions 
under the terms of the lease  toshiba has guaranteed those commitments on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments  and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims and associated expenses under the lease  unless the claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 

table of contents we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns  and if we and toshiba enter into definitive agreements to  and actually do  build  equip and operate fab  the impact of these downturns on us may be greater than they would otherwise be 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies and their customers products and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  production overcapacity  high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we have experienced these conditions in our business in the past and may experience such downturns in the future 
if we and toshiba enter into definitive agreements to build  equip and operate fab  and actually do so  the effect on us of significant downturns  price erosion or declines in customer demand may be greater as we will have made significant investments in fab and will have excess supply that we are obligated to take and pay for  regardless of current market conditions 
we may not be able to manage these downturns 
any future downturns of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
our investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
is subject to inherent risks  including those associated with certain israeli regulatory requirements  political unrest and financing difficulties  which could harm our business and financial condition 
in july  we entered into a share purchase agreement to make an aggregate million investment in tower semiconductor for tower s new foundry facility  fab  in five installments upon tower s completion of specific milestones 
as of december   we had invested million in tower and obtained  tower ordinary shares  million of prepaid wafer credits  and a warrant to purchase  tower ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant expires on october  the  tower ordinary shares represented an approximate equity ownership position in tower as of december  in fiscal we recorded write downs to the value of the wafer credits of million and utilized approximately million of these wafer credits to purchase controller wafers from tower 
also in  we recorded a million gain to adjust the book value of the warrant and as of december   we had recognized cumulative losses of approximately million as a result of the other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in tower ordinary shares  million as a result of the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and million of losses on our warrant to purchase tower ordinary shares 
as of december   our tower ordinary shares were valued at million and included an unrealized gain of million  inclusive of related tax expense impact of million  recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  our tower prepaid wafer credits were valued at million and the warrant to purchase tower ordinary shares was valued at million 
in february  we agreed to amend our foundry investment agreements with tower and advance the payment of million for the fifth and final milestone in two installments  a first installment of approximately million and a second installment of approximately million  regardless of whether the milestone was met 
tower s shareholders approved the amendment in may in november  we agreed to further amend the foundry investment agreements  referred to as the november amendment  to  among other things  a advance the entirety of the remaining fifth milestone payment of  or payment  b defer our use of wafer credits  and c extend the lock up period on our tower ordinary shares 
the november amendment was approved by tower s shareholders in december  following which approval we made the payment 
we received  tower ordinary shares at the time we made the payment and  tower ordinary shares in january upon the closing of tower s follow on public offering  which generated net cash to tower of approximately million and correspondingly reduced our equity ownership position 

table of contents also under the november amendment  we agreed not to use wafer credits until january   except with respect to purchase orders issued before the date of the november amendment utilizing wafer credits  however  we will have the option to convert credits we would have otherwise been able to utilize per quarter into tower ordinary shares at the day atp preceding the last day of the relevant quarter 
unconverted credits shall accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to three month libor plus through december  interest payments will be made quarterly and the aggregate principal amount of the unconverted credits will be repaid in one lump sum on december  effective as of december   we may convert all of the then remaining series a credits into tower ordinary shares at the day atp preceding december  if the number of tower ordinary shares received by us and the other wafer partners as a result of this conversion is greater than or equal to an aggregate of of tower s issued and outstanding share capital on january   tower will transact a rights offering for the distribution of rights to all of tower s shareholders  other than us and the other wafer partners but including israel corporation technologies  at the same day atp 
the november amendment also provides that we will not sell tower ordinary shares until january   except we may sell of the tower shares held as of january  in addition  we have extended the date on which we may exercise our demand registration rights until the earlier of i december  and ii such date that tower has fulfilled all of its obligations to raise any additional financing pursuant to its facility agreement 
full completion of tower s wafer foundry facility  fab and timely production ramp at fab  are dependent on several factors and may never occur  which may harm our business and results of operations 
tower s full completion of fab is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israeli government s investment center 
the current political uncertainty and security situation in the region may adversely impact tower s business prospects and may discourage investments in tower from outside sources 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry equipment purchases in a timely manner or is unable to successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies and ramp up of production  the value of our equity investment in tower and wafer credits will decline significantly or possibly become worthless 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain sufficient supply of controller wafers from tower to manufacture our products  which would harm our business 
further deterioration of market conditions for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products may also adversely affect the value of our equity investment in tower 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines  we may record additional losses  which potentially could amount to the remaining recorded value of our tower investment 
moreover  if tower is unable to satisfy its financial covenants and comply with the conditions in its credit facility agreement  and therefore is not able to obtain additional bank financing  or if its current bank obligations are accelerated  or it fails to secure customers for its foundry capacity to help offset its fixed costs  that failure could jeopardize the completion of fab  the production ramp at fab and tower s ability to continue operations 
tower is currently a sole source of supply for one of our new high volume controllers 
any interruption in tower s manufacturing operations resulting in delivery delays will adversely affect our ability to make timely shipments of some of our higher capacity products 
if this occurs  our operating results will be adversely affected until we can qualify an alternate source of supply  which could take a quarter or more to complete 
we cannot assure you that the fab facility will be fully completed or will continue its production ramp as scheduled 
moreover  we cannot assure you that this new facility will be able to sustain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price 
if tower is unable to operate fab at an optimum capacity utilization  it may operate at a loss or have to discontinue operations 
political unrest and violence in israel may hinder tower s ability to obtain investment in and complete its fabrication facility  which would harm our business 
political unrest and violence in israel could cause and could result in delays in the completion of fab and interruption or delay of manufacturing schedules once fab is completed  and could result in potential 
table of contents investors and foundry customers avoiding doing business with tower 
moreover  if us military actions in iraq  or elsewhere  result in retaliation against israel  tower s fabrication facility may be adversely impacted  causing a decline in the value of our investment 
a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against tower and certain of its shareholders and directors  including us and our president and ceo  a tower board member  which may be costly and could divert the attention of our management personnel 
on july   a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of united states holders of ordinary shares of tower as of the close of business on april  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the lawsuit was filed against tower and certain of its shareholders and directors  including us and dr 
eli harari  our president and ceo and a tower board member  and asserts claims arising under sections a and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the securities and exchange commission s rule a the lawsuit alleges that tower and certain of its directors made false and misleading statements in a proxy solicitation to tower shareholders regarding a proposed amendment to a contract between tower and certain of its shareholders  including us 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and attorneys and experts fees and expenses 
pursuant to our indemnification agreement with dr 
harari  we have agreed to indemnify him for any expenses he may incur or liability he may face in connection with this litigation 
litigation is inherently uncertain  can be costly and may divert the attention of our management personnel  and if we are required to pay significant monetary or other damages  our business  financial conditions and results of operations may be seriously harmed 
for additional information regarding this lawsuit  see item legal proceedings in part i of this annual report 
risk related to our investment in umc fluctuations in the market value of our umc foundry investment affect our financial results and in the past we recorded a loss on investment in foundry on our umc investment and we may record additional losses in the future 
in  we invested million in united silicon  inc  or usic  a semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary of united microelectronics corporation  or umc  which was merged into the umc parent company on january  in exchange for our usic shares  we received million umc shares 
in    and we received additional shares as stock dividends totaling approximately million  million  million and million shares  respectively 
we currently own million shares of umc stock 
our current equity investment in umc was valued at million at december  and included an unrealized gain of million  inclusive of related tax expense of million  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the fair value of our umc investment declines in future periods and the related loss is deemed to be other than temporary  we may record additional losses for those periods 
in addition  in future periods  we may recognize a gain or a loss upon the sale of our umc shares  which would impact our financial results 
risks related to vendors and subcontractors we depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors for several critical components and our products and our business could be harmed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components on a timely basis 
we rely on our vendors  some of which are a principal source of supply  for several of our critical components 
we do not have long term supply agreements with most of these vendors 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components 
we also rely on third party subcontractors for our wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  card assembly and card testing  including silicon precision industries co  ltd 
and united test center  inc in taiwan and celestica  inc and flextronics in china 
in addition to our existing subcontract suppliers  we are qualifying other subcontract suppliers for wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  card assembly  card 
table of contents testing and other products and services 
we have no long term contracts with our existing subcontractors nor do we expect to have long term contracts with any new subcontract suppliers 
as such  we cannot  and will not  be able to directly control product delivery schedules 
any significant problems that occur at our subcontractors  or their failure to perform at the level we expect  could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems  either of which could increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our operating results 
furthermore  we manufacture on a turnkey basis with some of our subcontract suppliers  which may reduce our visibility and control of their inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products 
we and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields or our costs will increase and production output will decrease  which could negatively impact our business 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures 
yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
the risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely exclusively on offshore foundries that we do not control for our wafers  which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if the foundries cannot achieve planned yields  we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to competition we face competition from flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers and if we cannot compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers 
our primary competitors currently include companies that develop and manufacture flash storage chips  such as renesas  samsung and toshiba 
new competitors including  hynix semiconductor  infineon  micron technologies  and st microelectronics  announced their intentions to become direct competitors in the nand market later this year 
in addition  we compete with companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory and companies that purchase flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory include  among others  atmel  hynix semiconductor  infineon  intel  macronix  micron technologies  renesas  sharp electronics  st microelectronics  samsung  spansion and toshiba 
companies that combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards  or that resell flash cards under their brand name  include  among others  dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  inc  fuji  hagiwara  hama  i o data  infineon  jessops  kingston technology  kodak  lexar media  m systems  matsushita battery  panasonic  memorex  micron technology  pny  pqi  pretec  renesas  silicon storage technology  silicon tek  simple technology  sony  samsung  tdk  toshiba  trek  viking components and several other resellers primarily located in taiwan 
the success of our competitors may adversely affect our future sales revenue 
we have entered into agreements with  and face direct competition from  toshiba  samsung and other competitors 
in  we  along with matsushita and toshiba  formed the sd association to jointly develop and promote the secure digital card 
under this arrangement  royalty bearing secure digital card licenses will be available to other flash memory card manufacturers  resulting in increased competition for our secure digital 
table of contents card and other products 
in addition  matsushita and toshiba sell secure digital cards that compete directly with our products for which no royalties are payable 
we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors  including  intel  matsushita  renesas  sst  samsung  sharp  sony  toshiba and tdk 
under these agreements  each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other party s patent or patents related to flash memory devices 
if we continue to license our patents to our competitors  competition will increase and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms that are favorable to us  or at all  or that these licenses will help our business 
our products compete against new products that promote different industry standards from ours  and if these new industry standards gain market acceptance  our business will be harmed 
each of our products faces competition from large and small suppliers  some introducing differentiated products that may be more attractive to our customers 
for example  lexar media s jump drive  m systems diskonkey  toshiba s trans memory and trek s thumbdrive compete directly with our cruzer mini product line and the secure multimediacard from renesas and infineon  the rs mmc from renesas and samsung  and the multimediacard from samsung all compete with our sd and mmc cards 
in addition  in  the xd picture card format was introduced as direct competition for our smart media card products 
we experienced a decline in sales of smart media card products in and and expect a continued decline in sales of these products in as sales of xd picture cards increases 
we compete with sony and lexar in the market for memory stick products 
sony has a very strong brand name which may make their memory stick cards more attractive to some customers than our comparable cards 
in  we expect to begin manufacturing and offering a sandisk labeled version of the memory stick pro and memory stick pro duo product lines 
additionally  olympus and fuji s control of the market for digital cameras using the xd picture card format gives them a competitive advantage in selling xd picture cards to retail customers 
rotating disk drives  including among others  the microdrive  compete with our larger capacity flash memory cards 
in addition  other companies  such as matrix semiconductor  have announced products or technologies that may potentially compete with our shoot and store products 
additionally  new card formats  like the express card are periodically introduced in an effort to compete with the existing standards for memory cards 
new competing standards may not be mechanically and electronically compatible with our products 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards  our products will be eliminated from use in that product 
we face competition from products based on alternative flash technologies and if we cannot compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we also face competition from products based on alternative mlc flash technology from intel strata flash  renesas ag and and infineon flash twin bit 
these products compete with our nand mlc products 
furthermore  we expect to face competition both from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with similar or alternative data storage solutions  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
our business is characterized by rapid innovation and many other companies are pursuing new technologies  which may make our flash memory obsolete or uncompetitive in a few years 
additionally  if we do not continue to invest in new technologies  our business would likely be seriously harmed 
risks related to sales of our products sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues and if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
approximately one half of our revenues come from a small number of customers 
for example  sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of our product revenues during fiscal  and 
table of contents if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
our sales are generally made by standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
in addition  the composition of our major customer base can change from year to year as the market demand for our customers products changes 
variability of average selling prices and gross margins resulting from changes in our product mix and price reductions for certain of our products may cause our gross margins and net profitability to suffer 
our product mix varies quarterly  which affects our overall average selling prices and gross margins 
our cf card  sd card  minisd card and memory stick card products  which currently account for a majority of our product revenues  have lower gross margins and average selling prices when sold as bundled cards in oem devices  such as digital cameras  compared to sales through retail channels 
in addition  we realize higher gross margins on flash memory products manufactured from wafers provided by our captive sources of supply than we do for flash packaged components supplied by non captive sources 
accordingly  if we are unable to meet our wafer needs through our captive suppliers and are forced to increase our purchases from non captive sources  we expect our gross margins to decline 
flash data storage markets are intensely competitive  and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points and may be significant 
if we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in future periods to offset further price reductions  our gross margins and net profitability will suffer 
our selling prices may decline due to excess capacity in the market for flash memory products and if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs to offset these price declines  our gross margins and net profitability will be harmed 
in the past  worldwide flash memory supply has exceeded customer demand  causing excess supply in the markets for our products and significant declines in average selling prices 
if this situation were to occur again  price declines for our products could be significant 
if we are unable to reduce our product manufacturing costs to offset these reduced prices  our gross margins and profitability would be adversely impacted 
our business depends significantly upon sales of products in the highly competitive consumer market  a significant portion of which are made to retailers and through distributors  and if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  we could experience substantial product returns  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we continued to receive more product revenue and ship more units of products for consumer electronics applications  including digital cameras and pdas  compared to other applications 
the consumer market is intensely competitive and is more price sensitive than our other target markets 
in addition  we must spend more on marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name recognition  maintain our competitive position at retailers and increase demand for our products 
a significant portion of our sales to the consumer electronics market is made direct to retailers and through distributors 
sales through these channels typically include rights to return unsold inventory and protection against price declines 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold through to the end user in the case of sales to retailers  or to distributor customers  in the case of sales to distributors 
if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  there could be substantial product returns or price protection claims  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  availability of sell through data varies throughout the retail channel  which makes it difficult for us to determine actual retail product revenues until after the end of the fiscal quarter 
sales of our products through our retail distribution channel include the use of third party fulfillment facilities that hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis  and if these fulfillment facilities were to experience a loss with respect to our inventory  we may not be able to recoup the full cost of the inventory  which would harm our business 
our retail distribution channel utilizes third party fulfillment facilities  such as modus media international  inc and nippon express 
these fulfillment houses hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis  providing packout services for our retail business  which include labeling and 
table of contents packaging our raw cards  as well as shipping the finished product directly to our customers 
while our third party fulfillment houses bear the risk of loss with respect to our inventory  the amount we are reimbursed by them or their insurers may be less than our original cost of the inventory  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is seasonality in our business  which may impact our product sales  particularly in the fourth and first quarters of the fiscal year 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics market may be subject to seasonality 
as a result  product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year followed by declines in the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from our japanese oem customers primarily because most customers in japan operate on a fiscal year ending in march and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of their next fiscal year 
risks related to our intellectual property we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and claims that we may be infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
we expect that we may be involved in similar disputes in the future 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage  or any of our products do not infringe on the patents of other companies 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents 
we intend to vigorously enforce our patents  but we cannot be sure that our efforts will be successful 
if we bring a patent infringement action and are not successful  our competitors would be able to use similar technology to compete with us 
moreover  the defendant in such an action may successfully assert a counterclaim that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
if we did not prevail as a defendant in a patent infringement case  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of specific processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
any litigation is likely to result in significant expense to us  as well as divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties as needed  or renew existing licenses  and we have agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement  which could expose us to liability for damages  increase our costs or limit or prohibit us from selling certain products 
if we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or if we are found to infringe on others intellectual property  we could be required to license intellectual property from a third party 
we may also need to license some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain cross licenses to third party patents 
currently  we have patent cross license agreements or similar intellectual property agreements with several companies  including  intel  matsushita  olympus  sst  renesas  samsung  sharp  silicon systems  smartdisk  sony  tdk and toshiba and we are in discussions with other companies 
table of contents regarding potential cross license agreements 
we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered when we need them  or that the terms offered will be acceptable  or that these licenses will help our business 
if we do obtain licenses from third parties  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments 
in addition  if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to the manufacture of our products  we could be required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our wafer suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses will be available under reasonable terms  or that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration  or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future 
we have historically agreed to indemnify suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies  but may  in some instances  include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorney s fees 
we may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement 
any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be involved in litigation regarding our intellectual property rights or those of third parties  which would be costly and would divert the efforts of our key technical and management personnel 
litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause litigation results to differ include  but are not limited to  the discovery of previously unknown facts  changes in the law or in the interpretation of laws  and uncertainties associated with the judicial decision making process 
we have been subject to  and expect to continue to be subject to  claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
furthermore  parties that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may counter sue us for infringing their patents 
litigation involving intellectual property can become complex and extend for protracted time and is often very expensive 
intellectual property claims  whether or not meritorious  may result in the expenditure of significant financial resources  injunctions against us or the imposition of damages that we must pay and would also divert the efforts and attention of some of our key management and technical personnel 
we may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights  but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
moreover  if we are required to pay significant monetary damages  are enjoined from selling any of our products or are required to make substantial royalty payments  our business would be harmed 
for additional information concerning legal proceedings  see item legal proceedings in part i of this report 
risks related to our international operations and changes in securities laws and regulations because of our international operations  we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations  and we are vulnerable to political instability and currency fluctuations 
political risks 
currently  all of our flash memory  controller wafers and flash memory products are produced overseas by flashvision  renesas  samsung  toshiba  tower and umc 
we also use third party subcontractors in taiwan  china and japan for the assembly and testing of some of our card and component products 
we may  therefore  be affected by the political  economic and military conditions in these countries 
taiwan is currently engaged in various political disputes with china and in the past both countries have conducted military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
the taiwanese and chinese governments may escalate these disputes  resulting in an economic embargo  disruption in shipping routes or even military hostilities 
this could harm our business by interrupting or delaying the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or card products by our taiwanese or japanese foundries and subcontractors 
under its current leadership  the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies and  even if it does continue  these policies may not be successful 
the chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to time 
in addition  china does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system  particularly with 
table of contents respect to the protection of intellectual property rights 
as a result  enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent 
such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection 
political unrest and violence in israel could cause delays in the completion of tower s fab and interruption or delay of manufacturing schedules once fab is completed  either of which could cause potential foundry customers to go elsewhere for their foundry business and could cause investors and foundry customers to avoid tower 
moreover  if us military actions in afghanistan  iraq or elsewhere  or current israeli military actions  result in retaliation against israel  tower s fabrication facility and our engineering design center in israel may be adversely impacted 
in addition  while the political unrest has not yet posed a direct security risk to our engineering design center in israel  it may cause unforeseen delays in the development of our products and may in the future pose such a direct security risk 
economic risks 
we price our products primarily in us dollars 
if the euro  yen and other currencies weaken relative to the us dollar  our products may be relatively more expensive in these regions  which could result in a decrease in our sales 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
general risks 
our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors the need to comply with foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  such as the earthquakes experienced in taiwan in  in japan in and previous years  and in china in previous years  reduced sales to our customers or interruption to our manufacturing processes in the pacific rim that may arise from regional issues in asia  imposition of regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  particularly as we increase our sales through the retail distribution channel and general business conditions deteriorate  adverse tax rules and regulations  weak protection of our intellectual property rights  and delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  the war in iraq and threats of war elsewhere  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states  us military responses to these attacks  the war in iraq and threats of war elsewhere and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a negative impact on consumer retail demand  which is the largest channel for our product sales 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the united states and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets  which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers or adversely affect consumer 
table of contents confidence 
this could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july required changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also required the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made  nasdaq has proposed additional revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
risks related to our charter documents  stockholder rights plan  our stock price  our debt rating and the raising of additional financing anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have a stockholders rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action  of which have already been reserved under our stockholder rights plan 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that a stockholder became an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of sandisk 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile  which could result in investors losing all or part of their investments 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  in the months ended december   our stock price fluctuated significantly from a low of to a high of 
we believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of future announcements concerning us  our competitors or principal customers regarding technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile  often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies 
these fluctuations as well as general economic  political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock 

table of contents the ratings assigned to us and our notes may fluctuate  which could harm the market price of our common stock 
we and our notes have been rated by standard poor s ratings services  and may be rated by other rating agencies in the future 
standard poor s ratings services assigned its b corporate credit rating to us and its b subordinated debt rating to our notes 
if our current ratings are lowered or if other rating agencies assign us or the notes ratings lower than expected by investors  the market price of our common stock could be significantly harmed 
we may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from increasing our wafer supply  developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
we may need to raise additional funds  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities 
if we issue additional equity securities in the future  our stockholders will experience dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock or debt securities 
in addition  if we raise funds through debt financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could harm our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could have a negative impact on our business 
risks related to our indebtedness we have convertible subordinated notes outstanding  which may restrict our cash flow  make it difficult for us to obtain future financing  divert our resources from other uses  limit our ability to react to changes in the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result of the sale and issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in december and january  we incurred million aggregate principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
while the notes are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately million per year in interest payments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  cause us to use a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents or possibly liquidate other assets to repay the total principal amount due under the notes and our other indebtedness if we were to default under the notes or our other indebtedness  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business and the industries in which we complete  
table of contents place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify toshiba for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments  and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims and associated expenses under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 
this contingent indemnification obligation might constitute senior indebtedness under the notes and we may use a portion of the proceeds from the notes to repay the obligation 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to satisfy a fundamental change offer under the indenture governing the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a fundamental change 
a fundamental change as defined in the indenture would occur if we were to be acquired for consideration other than depository receipts or common stock traded on a major us securities market 
if someone triggers a fundamental change  we may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we have to make a fundamental change offer  we cannot be sure that we will have enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender 
our failure to redeem tendered notes upon a fundamental change would constitute a default under the indenture and might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness  which would significantly harm our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations  which would cause us to be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  which would result in harm to our business and financial condition 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other indebtedness  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and also could cause defaults under our other indebtedness 
any such default would harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 
the notes and other indebtedness have rights senior to those of our current stockholders such that in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness is repaid 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available for distribution to 
table of contents our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness  including our contingent indemnification obligations to toshiba and obligations under the notes  have been paid in full 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to make any distributions to our stockholders 
the notes are also effectively subordinated to the liabilities of any of our subsidiaries including trade payables  which as of december  were approximately million 
neither we  nor our subsidiaries are limited from incurring debt  including senior indebtedness  under the indenture 
if we or our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
we anticipate that from time to time we will incur additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
our subsidiaries are also likely to incur liabilities in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   we had a warrant to purchase  ordinary shares of tower at a fair value of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
currency forward contracts are utilized in this hedging program 
our hedging program reduces  but does not always entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes in of approximately million 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio and equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains on short term equity securities totaling million  which were included in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains include an unrealized gain of million on the change in value of our investment in umc and million on our investment in tower 
the market value of our investments in umc and tower have fluctuated significantly in the past and may decline in the future due to downturns in the semiconductor industry  declines in demand for umc s products or unfavorable economic conditions 
if we sell our remaining umc shares in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of our umc stock 
in  and  we recognized losses of million  million and million  respectively  on the other than temporary decline in the value of our tower investment and the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further or the wafer credits are deemed to have little or no value  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
