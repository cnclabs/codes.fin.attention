item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a begins with an executive overview of our business 
this overview includes a description of our business goals  the business models for our segments  key events of and certain trends  risks and challenges 
we then discuss our results of operations for and compared to and  respectively 
this is followed by a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources  including cash resources  sources and uses of cash and commercial commitments 
we conclude with a discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important for the reader to understand our reported financial results and our business outlook for you should read the md a together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included in this annual report 
in addition to historical and pro forma information  the md a contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from those presently anticipated due to a variety of factors  including those discussed in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements included in this discussion do not reflect the potential impact of any divestitures  mergers  acquisitions or other business combinations that may be completed after march  executive overview our business our goal is to enable trusted commerce by delivering integrated information  payment and technology solutions that strengthen our customers overall profitability through increased revenue  reduced costs and improved operating efficiency and technology performance 
our principal focus is on issuers of transaction accounts  such as financial institutions  financial services companies  electronic funds networks  retailers  government agencies  ecommerce providers  telecommunications companies and other businesses 
we deliver our information  payment and technology solutions through the four basic capabilities or competencies and through combinations of these products and services 
our most profitable business segments are electronic payments and risk management  although our global outsourcing and atm management segments also contribute to our overall value proposition 
one of our goals for and beyond is to enhance our ability to market and sell comprehensive solutions incorporating multiple elements of the products and services offered by our business lines to our customers 
the business model of each of our segments is summarized below 
electronic payments this segment derives its revenue based upon our customers needs to process electronic debit transactions 
the majority of this segment s revenue is derived from processing debit transactions that originate at an atm or point of sale device 
the remaining revenue is derived from the licensing of the eft software used to process electronic debit transactions 
the provision of eft processing services requires substantial capital investment for computers and related peripherals  maintenance  system modifications and upgrades  security and redundancy 
although these requirements add barriers to competitive entrance  they also create a relatively high ratio of fixed operating costs to total costs 
processors are also required to maintain significant cash reserves to cover temporary imbalances in the flow of funds associated with electronic funds transfers 
additionally  the software applications used for processing at our data centers and which we license to our software customers are primarily developed in house and require frequent compliance updates and competitive upgrades  creating a dependence upon experienced and qualified it personnel 
other operating expenses include telecommunications costs to support the transmission of electronic debit transactions and settlement 
the acquisition of oasis in november expanded this segment s software offering from legacy platforms to lower cost open platforms 
when evaluating the performance of this business  we focus primarily on increasing its recurring revenue base through  among other things  the retention of our current processing customers and the acquisition of new processing relationships 
expanding our software sales and establishing a processing presence in foreign markets are also areas of management emphasis 
atm management our atm management segment derives its revenues from the use  sale and maintenance of atms 
surcharge and interchange revenue represented the majority of our revenue from this segment in equipment sales are non recurring and  along with branding fees  represent a minority of the revenue in this segment 
operating costs in this segment primarily include processing and telecommunication costs  the cost of the equipment we sell and the residual payments we make to the merchants where the atms we manage are deployed 
our primary goal for this business is to continue to improve its margins by lowering costs and providing additional services 
risk management this segment derives its revenue from database inquiries by financial institutions and retailers seeking to comply with regulations and or mitigate the risk associated with accepting checks  providing credit or opening debit accounts for new consumers 
revenue from financial institutions represented the majority of this segment s revenue in and the balance was derived from retail customers using our check verification service 
operating costs generally include data acquisition costs and the cost of technology and regulatory compliance infrastructure and customer support centers 
our primary efforts in managing this business are directed towards increasing its revenues by improving customer usage rates and expanding our product suite 
global outsourcing our global outsourcing business derives its revenues from the need of companies to remain competitive through reducing costs while maintaining or improving service levels 
revenues in this segment are from a variety of business process outsourcing services such as call centers  application processing and data entry and it outsourcing 
operating costs in this segment are primarily related to employee expense and telecommunications and facilities costs 
our principal goal for this business is to expand its customer base in our core target markets of financial service  retail and telecommunications companies in our bpo solutions area 
key events in a new team of senior business executives was recruited to streamline our operations  reduce our costs  improve the customer focus of our business and to prepare our company for growth in the future 
revenue was adversely impacted by the expiration of significant government and processing contracts in and a decline in the revenues we received from deluxe 
we initiated multiple business process initiatives to improve processes and identify cost savings  resulting in reduced operating expenses 
we established strategic distribution alliances for our processing business with mastercard and bisys 
industry consolidation and strong competition resulted in pricing pressures 
we acquired oasis technology ltd  providing us with open systems software capability  a global distribution network and over international software customers 
we established return on invested capital as a key corporate performance measurement tool for and beyond 
we renewed our eft processing contracts with citishare and co op 
we began providing electronic benefit transfer ebt services as a prime contractor in the states of alabama  missouri and north carolina 
we refined our long term strategy to focus on maximizing the value of consumer transaction accounts and increasing the inter dependency of our business lines 
we retained kpmg llp as our independent auditor as the successor to deloitte touche llp 
we added richard j 
almeida as a member of our board of directors 
trends our strategic planning and forecasting processes include the consideration of economic  industry wide and company specific trends that may impact our customers  competitors and our operations 
we have identified the more material positive and negative trends affecting our business below increased fraud and identity theft and regulatory requirements are driving an increasing need for risk management products  consolidation in the industries we serve is resulting in increasing competition and pricing pressures  increased outsourcing as a means to control costs is driving an outsourcing demand  there is growing political opposition to the use of offshore outsourcing services  a continued shift in the mix of payment mechanisms toward debit transactions is driving a need for electronic payment solutions and associated risk management services  our sales of it outsourcing services has been declining  the rate of new atm deployment and per atm transaction volumes in the united states is declining  atm markets outside the united states are growing  and our india operations are experiencing increasing compensation costs and employee attrition rates as competition increases 
risks and challenges in addition to the trends affecting our industry and company as noted above  we consider risks and challenges that could impact the company s future financial results  including the following and those described in exhibit to this annual report on form k we are unable to predict the results of the investigation by the sec  the pending stockholders litigation or the purported class action litigation filed in florida 
estimates of future financial results are inherently unreliable 
consolidation in the industries we serve may adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services 
our efforts to improve the margins of our atm management business may not be successful 
our ability to expand through acquisitions involves risks and may not be successful 
we face intense competition in all areas of our business  and if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
if we experience system failures  the products and services we provide to our customers could be delayed or interrupted  which would harm our business and reputation and result in the loss of customers 
legislation or regulation could harm our ability to collect and use data  increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business 
if the security of our databases is compromised  our reputation could suffer and customers may not be willing to use our products and services 
we may experience software defects  development delays and installation difficulties  which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability 
there are a number of risks associated with our international sales and operations that could harm our business 
changes in indian tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
we face termination and compliance risks with respect to our government contracts 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated financial results for the three years ended december  change dollars in thousands net revenue operating expenses processing  communication and service costs employee costs depreciation and amortization other operating costs restructuring  asset impairment and other charges reversal of provision for contract losses total operating expenses income from operations other income net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
net revenue net revenue by reportable segment and for the company as a whole for the three years ended december  was as follows change dollars in thousands net revenue electronic payments atm management risk management global outsourcing total net revenue electronic payments processing revenue decreased in both and primarily due to the termination of processing services previously provided to the star network following the licensing of our eft software to star in the third quarter of processing revenues from the star network were approximately million in and approximately million in our contract to provide medicare eligibility verification services to the state of new york also expired at the end of revenues from this contract were approximately million in the revenues from the additional ebt contracts we obtained in did not completely offset the loss of revenue on the expired new york contract 
in  we expect that our processing revenues from financial institutions will increase due to increased volumes 
this increase will be somewhat offset by a decline in revenues from our government services business due to contract expirations 
we acquired oasis technology ltd 
oasis in november of incremental software revenues in from this acquisition were approximately million 
the revenue from oasis was more than offset by a general decline in software license fee revenues from to the licensing of our eft software to the star network is reflected in our software revenue in we would not expect to see software sales of this magnitude to recur  although we expect software revenues to increase in due to the acquisition of oasis 
the following table illustrates our revenue generated from software sales year ended december  in thousands license fees maintenance software modifications atm management atm processing revenue increased approximately million in as compared to due to our receipt of a full year of revenue from the acquisitions we completed in this segment in equipment sales and branding revenues also increased in over we are redirecting the focus of this business towards offering an end to end atm portfolio management service to financial institutions and retailers 
we do not presently anticipate acquiring additional atm service providers in and we expect revenues from this segment to increase modestly in  largely from the sale of atm managed services 
the increase in atm revenue from to is due primarily to incremental revenues of approximately million from the acquisitions of additional atm networks in risk management revenues from our chexsystems sm suite of products increased for both as compared to and as compared to  primarily due to inquiry volume growth driven by our marketing campaign to encourage better customer screening by financial institutions in light of the usa patriot act 
for both years  the increase in revenues from chexsystems was partially offset by declines in sales of our scan sm and collection products over the prior year 
the decrease in revenues from scan products was attributable primarily to pricing concessions in and the loss of customers in we expect that revenues from chexsystems and our fraud protection products will continue to increase in future periods and that the customer base for our scan products has stabilized 
global outsourcing revenues from information technology it services provided under our contract with deluxe declined approximately million in as compared to in accordance with our agreement with deluxe  a minimal short fall fee  based upon a formula in the contract reflective of our estimated lost profits  was billed to deluxe as it failed to reach the minimum target level of million for software development services for the year 
revenue from other it services declined approximately million from to as a result of our decision in to suspend sales and marketing efforts on our stand alone information technology development services 
we expect to finalize our it services strategy in business process outsourcing bpo revenues  which include outsourcing and customer contact center services  increased approximately million in as compared to the prior year due to the expansion of services provided under existing bpo contracts 
we expect growth in our bpo business will come from the acquisition of new clients and the continued expansion of the services offered to existing clients 
this business features  however  lengthy sales cycles and so we expect that any ramp up of revenues will occur relatively gradually 
business segment margin contributions the following table presents our operating income loss by segment  unallocated corporate expenses and consolidated operating income for the three years ended december  change dollars in thousands operating income loss electronic payments atm management risk management global outsourcing corporate total operating income represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
electronic payment margins in were adversely impacted by the expiration of processing and government service contracts during the latter part of competitive pressures led to pricing concessions in  offsetting the impact of increasing volumes and resulting in a degree of margin contraction 
additionally  performance based compensation expense increased approximately million in as bonus incentives were not accrued in higher margin software revenues declined approximately million in we expect operating income from this segment to decline slightly in as compared to as  unlike  we do not expect to record reversals of the provision for government services loss contracts during in  million in restructuring and asset impairment charges attributable to this segment were largely offset by an approximately million reduction in performance based compensation expense as compared to the reduction seen in in higher margin software revenue was largely offset by cost reduction measures implemented in and  including the relocation of contact center work to our indian operations 
the loss of star network processing revenues in the last quarter of resulted  however  in additional margin contraction 
atm management the increase in the margins of this business in is the result of a focus on improving equipment sales margins and expanding our sales of branding services 
we will seek to further improve the margins in this business in future periods by offering atm management services to large retailers and financial institutions 
we expect margins from this business to continue to increase in margin improvement from to was primarily the result of our efforts to integrate the atm businesses we acquired in risk management the margin improvement during is due to the elimination of low margin product lines and the reduction in employee and third party costs through initiatives such as the transition of contact center work to our indian operations 
in addition  restructuring costs of million were charged to this segment during compared to million in we expect a continued increase in the margins from this segment in as a result of a full year of cost savings 
the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges we recorded in this segment in related to severance  lease expense and asset impairments  as compared to million recorded in for the closure of our former bothell  washington facility 
the increase in restructuring costs in was offset by an approximate million reduction in expense recorded for performance based compensation from the amounts recorded during global outsourcing the results of this segment for were adversely impacted by the reduction in it outsourcing and bpo services provided to deluxe  pricing concessions on existing contracts and increases in compensation costs 
we expect a modest improvement in the margins of this business in from a combination of the restructuring of our it services group and new bpo contracts 
the improvement in operating margin from to was due primarily to an approximate million reduction in performance based compensation expense 
corporate unallocated corporate overhead includes  among other things  executive leadership costs  investor relations  general legal  consulting and accounting and finance costs and certain technology costs 
the decrease in expenses seen in over is primarily due to million in severance benefits and lease impairment charges that were recorded in approximately million of the accrual for the lease impairment was reversed in due to the subletting of the associated facilities 
expenses were more in as compared to due to the additional costs incurred in the latter part of for the transition of executive leadership and the relocation of certain administration functions from wisconsin to arizona 
we expect corporate expenses to be relatively flat in the increase in corporate expenses from to is primarily related to increased professional service fees associated with the sec inquiry and the accounting review we completed in the fourth quarter of as well as the million of restructuring and asset impairment charges we recorded in expenses for facility rental costs related to the expansion of our facilities in scottsdale  arizona and for corporate insurance and employee health benefits also increased 
these increases were partially offset by an approximately million reduction for performance based compensation and the elimination of goodwill amortization expense 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization expense in operating expenses operating expenses for the three years ended december  were as follows change dollars in thousands operating expenses processing  communication and service costs employee costs depreciation and amortization other operating costs restructuring  asset impairment and other charges reversal of provision for contract losses total operating expenses represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
processing  communication and service costs this category includes the cost of transaction processing  telecommunications  computer equipment and promotional services 
this category also includes residual payments  or the payments we make to the occupants of the property where the atms that we own or manage are located 
during  atm processing and service costs increased approximately million due to a full year of processing volume for the atm network acquisitions that we completed in this increase was offset by a decrease in third party costs of approximately million due to the migration of support services for our risk management business to our india operations 
additionally  equipment rental and maintenance and telecommunications costs were reduced approximately million due to contract renegotiations 
during  telecommunications and residual payments increased along with the increase in atm processing revenues associated with the atm network acquisitions in and employee costs employee compensation  payroll taxes and medical expenses decreased approximately million during due primarily to a person reduction in us headcount 
company wide headcount increased from approximately  at december  to  at december  as a result of the migration of business processes to our india facilities and increased demand for our outsourcing services 
at december  more than of our employees were located in india 
performance based compensation was reinstituted in resulting in an increase to compensation costs of approximately million over we expect future employee costs and headcount to increase in in connection with new bpo business 
employee costs decreased approximately million in compared to due primarily to the elimination of performance based employee compensation for as a result of reduced revenue and earnings expectations 
we also began to experience cost savings late in from our restructuring efforts and the curtailment of travel expenditures 
depreciation and amortization these costs represent depreciation of facilities and equipment and the amortization of intangible assets  such as capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of the sale of buildings during upon reclassification of the buildings and related assets as held for sale in the third quarter of  depreciation of those assets ceased 
depreciation on these assets was million in  million in and zero in additionally  we recorded goodwill amortization of approximately million such amortization ceased in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other operating costs expenditures in this category include facility costs  professional  consulting and temporary services  bad debt  and certain administrative costs 
external consulting costs increased approximately million during over due to on going strategic planning and business performance efficiency initiatives 
this increase was offset somewhat by reductions in legal and accounting expense of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur expenses for legal services associated with the sec inquiry and stockholder litigation in and for external consultants related to the business improvement initiatives we commenced in early during  other operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in professional services associated with responding to the sec inquiry and the accounting review we completed in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense based upon a change in estimates used for our calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
restructuring  asset impairment and other charges during  we initiated a significant effort to reduce our cost structure by eliminating unprofitable product lines  improving our internal business processes and increasing the utilization of our india based resources 
these measures resulted in restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
the charges were comprised of expected severance benefits totaling million for the elimination of approximately positions primarily in the united states  impairment of fixed assets totaling million including a million charge to write down a building in glendale  wisconsin that was held for sale  lease related costs of million related to the consolidation of facilities and a charge of million for software impairment related to products that were discontinued 
during  we reversed million of the lease related charges we recorded in to reflect the successful subletting of a portion of the properties subject to those leases 
due to the business process improvement initiatives identified during  we recorded restructuring charges for severance benefits of million 
we also recorded a million charge for the write off of in process research and development in connection with our acquisition of oasis 
the in process project relates to a product that assists card issuers in managing customer cards  generating billing statements  tracking account authorization  calculating overdrafts  issuing new cards and performing various other tasks 
this product is scheduled to be released in the latter half of we could record similar charges in results for included a restructuring charge of million related to the closure of our former bothell  washington facility 
reversal of provision for contract losses in  we recorded a million benefit related to a reduction in our estimate of future losses on certain government ebt contracts 
similar net benefits of million and million were taken in the third quarters of and  respectively 
actual results have been better than previously estimated due primarily to higher case counts and savings on costs such as telecommunications 
the government service contracts for which the loss reserve was established are approaching their expiration dates and  accordingly  the balance of the loss contract reserve has declined substantially 
at december  the balance of this reserve was approximately million 
other income net other income net primarily includes interest and investment income that is enhanced or reduced by gains and losses on the disposal of assets  interest and investment expense and foreign currency translation adjustments 
interest earned on cash and cash equivalents was million in  million in and million in provision for income taxes the annualized effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from to reflects the benefit of certain permanent deductions taken by the company in  some of which related to prior tax years 
the decrease in our effective tax rate from to was primarily a result of the cessation of goodwill amortization in as this expense was non deductible for tax purposes 
we expect our annualized effective tax rate to approximate in our effective tax rate is largely determined by our indian subsidiary s proportional share of our projected consolidated income 
our indian software development and business process outsourcing operations qualify for tax incentives associated with businesses that operate within designated geographic locations within india 
these incentives generally provide us with exemptions from indian income tax on certain business income generated from these operations and phase out through march the effect of these tax incentives was to reduce our income tax expense by approximately million in  million in and million in liquidity and capital resources overview information about our financial position as of december  and is presented below change dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents long term debt due within one year long term debt stockholders equity net working capital represents an increase or decrease in excess of 
cash resources in  we expect our beginning cash balance and cash provided from operations in to be sufficient to meet our normal operating commitments and to fund planned capital expenditures and acquisitions 
cash and cash equivalents at december  included cash in atms of approximately million and cash in india of approximately million 
the funds in india are held in indian bank accounts denominated in indian rupees or us dollars 
these funds are available for use in our indian operations and investments 
we consider these funds to be permanently invested and have no current intention of repatriating them to the united states of america 
as part of our transaction processing business  we provide cash settlement services to financial institutions and state and local governments 
these services involve the movement of funds between the various parties associated with an atm  point of sale or ebt transaction and this activity results in a balance due to us at the end of each business day that we recoup over the next few business days 
the balances due us are included in cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   approximately million of settlement payments were due to us and we received these funds in early january we are required to maintain sufficient cash on hand to fund the daily settlement advances we make against the payments we receive through the settlement process 
the typical overnight settlement balance due to us ranges from million to million 
we also seek to maintain an additional cash balance of approximately million to ensure that we can advance funds to our processing customers if unusual circumstances prevent us from timely processing their settlement files 
we are considering an overnight credit facility to fund these obligations 
we have vault cash agreements with various financial institutions that provide cash to certain of the atms owned or managed by us 
although some portion of this cash may be physically located in the atms that we own or manage  these funds are not included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet because we do not take title to it under the bailee bailor relationship as established by the agreements 
based upon the daily outstanding balance of funds provided to the atms  we generally pay a monthly fee ranging from prime  as defined  plus one half percent up to prime plus 
we indemnify the financial institutions against any loss of the vault cash in the atms 
one of the agreements requires us to maintain a security amount equal to of the daily outstanding balance 
the average monthly rate paid during approximated 
the agreements may be terminated upon notice by either party and have various expiration dates through march cash provided at december  pursuant to agreements with third party vault cash providers was approximately million 
we do not currently anticipate using our funds to pay cash dividends or repurchase our stock during the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december  in total and for the time periods specified 
our long term debt consists principally of capital lease obligations related to equipment 
payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations vendor obligations total future minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases are presented net of minimum sublease rentals of million due in the future under non cancelable subleases 
purchase orders for goods and services are not included in this table 
our purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements and are based upon current service needs and are generally fulfilled by our vendors within one or two months 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchases of services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  such as fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we are party to certain other contracts with third parties whereby the third party provides services to us 
these services are operational in nature and our obligations under these contracts vary from period to period based on our utilization of these services 
these commitments are not reflected in the table above as the associated amounts are not currently determinable 
sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flow activity for the three years ended december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows summary of cash flows years ended december  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents our current priorities for use of our cash are investment in high return capital and operational projects with the intention of increasing our product delivery and operational effectiveness  enhancing our product suite and the redundancy of our systems  complementary acquisitions  and ensuring we can fund our settlement obligations 
operating activities our primary source of liquidity is the profits we generate from our business 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for processing and telecommunications services  consulting services and supplies 
we also pay salaries and benefits to our employees and income taxes 
the cash we earned from operating activities was approximately the same for and performance based bonuses were not accrued in and therefore not paid during  resulting in a positive impact to cash flow in performance based bonuses were  however  accrued at the end of and we paid these bonuses during the first quarter of the benefit from the elimination of incentive payments for was offset somewhat by a decrease in our accounts payable  primarily as a result of the migration from the use of vendors for outside services to the utilization of our employee workforce in india and to a general reduction in expenses overall 
in  cash flows from operating activities were positively impacted by greater net income and by the lapse of certain restrictions on our cash 
we reclassified approximately million of cash from restricted to unrestricted primarily due to the atm vault cash we had provided to access cash international llc aci prior to our acquisition of the company in the fall of investing activities cash from investing activities generally includes cash effects from the sale or acquisition of assets 
during we used approximately million to acquire oasis and approximately million to purchase fixed assets and develop software 
these expenditures were offset by approximately million in proceeds we received from the sale of buildings that were classified as held for sale at december  we used less cash in investing activities in as compared to and because we spent less money on acquiring businesses  buying fixed assets and developing software 
we used approximately million in for the acquisition of four atm networks and approximately million in  primarily to complete our acquisition of aci 
we expect to acquire complementary businesses in  but we cannot predict the amount we will spend on this activity with certainty 
we also expect our capital expenditures to increase to approximately million in from the million we recorded in  primarily as a result of the re architecture of our technical infrastructure and product development activities 
financing activities we receive financing funds from the exercise of stock options and the sale of our shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
financing outflows generally include the repayment of debt 
in  we used cash to repay debt of approximately million 
these payments were more than offset by the approximately million in proceeds we received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
we received approximately million and million in and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares through our employee stock purchase plan 
we used cash to repay debt of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
in  approximately million in time deposit funds was released that had previously been held as collateral to support our guarantee of an indian facility 
we cannot predict how much cash we will receive from option exercises and employee stock purchases in  but we would generally expect the amounts generated from these sources to be consistent with our experience in commercial commitments the following table sets forth our future commercial commitments as of december  commitment expiration by period in thousands total thereafter letters of credit and other guarantees performance bonds total commitments prior to our acquisition of aci in  we had committed to guarantee up to approximately million of equipment lease payments for aci s canadian customers and as of december   were guaranteeing lease payments amounting to approximately million 
through december   we have been required to make payments of  pursuant to these guarantees 
we use cash collateral to secure letters of credit we issue in the ordinary course of business 
we had million in letters of credit outstanding at december   mostly related to leases 
these letters of credit were secured by million in cash collateral 
we have also pledged million of time deposits as collateral related to the guarantee of performance on a customer contract and certain obligations related to local government requirements 
in connection with our government services business  collection and atm placement activities  we post surety bonds with state agencies guaranteeing our performance of certain obligations related to the relevant contracts or state requirements 
the aggregate amount of such bonds outstanding at december  was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  intangible assets  reserves and allowances  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net revenues consist of fees for transaction processing and related services  risk management  software and data licensing  maintenance and support  government services  and information technology consulting and business process outsourcing services 
revenue arrangements entered into subsequent to june  with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if the item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and delivery of the item is considered probable and substantially in our control if a general right of return on the delivered unit exists 
the total consideration associated with the arrangement is allocated among each of the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is considered separately for each unit of accounting 
our revenue recognition policies for the various types of fees our business receives are as follows transaction processing and service fees are recognized in the period that the service is performed 
these services consist of processing our customers electronic debit transactions and settling the funds with the financial institutions involved in the transactions 
these services also include monitoring atms to alert our customers when potential problems occur 
transaction processing and service fees are charged on a per transaction basis  depending on the contractual arrangement with the customer 
government services fees are recognized in the period services are provided based on monthly fees per benefits recipient 
in connection with the provision of services in the atm management services segment  we earn surcharge and interchange fees as the primary service provider 
surcharge fees are the familiar fees the user of an atm pays at the time of a transaction 
interchange fees are paid by that user s financial institution 
we assume the credit risk associated with collection of these fees 
generally  our arrangements call for us to pay a fee to the occupants of the property at which the atm is physically located 
the amount of this fee typically has some relationship to the surcharge and interchange fees that are collected by us on individual transactions 
based upon the underlying contractual provisions to our arrangements  we record the surcharge and interchange fees that we collect at their gross amounts as revenue and the residual payments to the occupant of the property at which the atm is physically located is recorded as a processing  communication and service cost 
risk management fees are recognized as revenue in the period the services are provided 
risk management services consist of new account applicant and check verification screenings to manage the risk associated with account openings and check acceptance 
risk management fees are based on the number of inquiries against the databases used for screening purposes or monthly fees based on the net monthly sales of the retailer using our check verification products or other similar measures  depending on the product and service 
we provide professional services consisting of information technology consulting and business process outsourcing services 
revenue from providing these services is generally recognized under one of two methods  depending on the relevant contractual terms 
under the time and materials method  which is applied to nearly all of our professional services contracts  revenue is based on a fee per hour basis and is recognized as hours are completed 
under the fixed contract method  a pre set fee is agreed upon for a project and revenue is recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
if the information technology consulting services involve the significant customization of software that has been licensed from us  the license fee and related service fees are also recognized proportionately to the percentage of completion of the project 
software and data license fees for standard products are recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the license fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility of the license fee is probable  delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance 
if a license contains customer acceptance criteria for which significant uncertainties exist  the revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
certain software products include multiple modules and the license fee charged to the customer is based on the modules licensed 
if a customer contract requires that we deliver multiple elements  then upfront fees are recognized as revenue if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each of the undelivered elements 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist  then the total fees of the arrangement are recognized over the term of the related agreement based upon delivery of all essential elements 
software maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or as the services are provided 
the process involved in evaluating the appropriateness of revenue recognition involves judgments about vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each of the various elements to be delivered in a sale that has multiple components  collectibility of fees  and projections of costs to complete projects for our customers 
intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  capitalized software costs and acquired contracts 
capitalized software we capitalize the cost of software developed or obtained for internal use once the preliminary project stage has been completed  management commits to funding the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
software developed or obtained for internal use is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as when we elect to discontinue a product line 
we capitalize the cost of software developed for licensing and resale once technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to determine that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization of costs ceases when the product is available for general release to customers 
such costs are amortized on a product by product basis normally over three years and no longer than five years 
software developed for resale is carried at the lesser of amortized cost or net realizable value 
goodwill when we acquire other companies  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that we make estimates regarding the fair value of the acquired company s tangible assets and liabilities and its identifiable intangible assets 
based upon these estimates  we then allocate the purchase price to the assets and liabilities of the acquired company for the purpose of recording these items in our financial records 
any unallocated purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the distinction between the amount of the purchase price allocated either to tangible assets and liabilities or identifiable intangible assets and goodwill is significant because goodwill is not amortized to our statement of operations but is instead subject to an annual impairment test 
estimates inherent in the process of this purchase price allocation include assumptions regarding the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  the salability of inventories  selection of discount rates  contract renewal rates and general market conditions 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in making these estimates 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment  to determine if the goodwill we have recorded is impaired 
this review includes the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including its associated goodwill 
the carrying value of the reporting unit includes an allocation of those corporate assets and liabilities that have not been specifically identified with a reporting unit  based upon its pro rata percentage of our total net revenue 
we primarily rely on the income method to determine a reporting unit s fair value 
this approach is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates of the reporting unit s revenue and costs and a discount rate based upon the estimated weighted average cost of capital for that reporting unit 
our estimates of segment market growth and costs are based upon historical data  various internal estimates and external sources 
we develop these estimates as part of our routine long term strategic planning 
we test the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying our discounted cash flow analysis by the available and comparable market data 
the goodwill associated with our atm management business could be impaired in the future if we fail to achieve the presently expected gross margin improvements 
acquired contracts the fair value of acquired contracts is measured based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from the contracts  including expected renewals 
the majority of these intangibles are amortized on an accelerated method that is intended to mirror the cash flow patterns and duration used in estimating the value recognized from an acquired contract 
where appropriate  we use third party valuation professionals to assist us in determining the fair value and amortizable life of contracts at the time of their acquisition 
this type of intangible asset could be impaired if the contract attrition rate is materially more than the rate used to estimate its present value 
reserves and allowances loss contract reserve we maintain a reserve for expected future losses on certain long term government service contracts 
our estimates of these losses are based on our best estimate of the contract s revenue and costs 
we use a variety of assumptions  including assumptions about future welfare case levels  the number of transactions per case and the costs related to processing transactions and providing support services 
these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties and actual results may differ from our estimates 
in the event such differences arise  a revision to the loss contract reserve would be required 
any such revision could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
actual losses on individual long term service contracts are compared with loss projections periodically  with any changes in the estimated total contract loss recognized as they become probable and reasonably estimable 
we could record additional losses or record a reversal of the loss provision in the event that actual and projected revenues and expenses do not track with our original estimates 
in the past three years  we recorded a reversal of our loss contracts provision as a result of revenues and costs tracking better than our previous estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our estimates of how often our customers will fail to make their required payments 
we develop this allowance based on our experience with specific customers  our understanding of their current economic circumstances and our own judgment as to the likelihood of their ultimate payment 
we also consider our collection experience with the balance of our receivables portfolio and make estimates regarding collectibility based on trends in aging 
the estimates utilized to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts were revised during to be more reflective of our collection history following the establishment of our collections and credit committee and the implementation of enhanced collection processes and systems 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  thereby impairing their ability to make payments  an increase in this allowance could be required in a future period 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to make significant judgments in estimating our future income taxes 
these judgments include  but are not be limited to  the likelihood we will realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of our valuation allowances  the rates to be used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries and the valuation models to be used for measuring the value of certain transactions 
further  our operations are governed by and subject to government regulations in the united states and in foreign countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to taxation and the judgments and estimates we use are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
we recognize tax liabilities at the time that they are judged to be probable of being incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that either foreign or domestic taxing authorities could challenge our judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause us to incur tax liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested and  accordingly  we have not provided for us federal  state income or applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  upon any distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and applicable withholding taxes payable to the foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with such a hypothetical calculation 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees under the terms of the efunds corporation stock option plan 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap provide two alternative methods of accounting for stock options issued under the terms and conditions that we typically issue such options 
one alternative is to estimate the fair value of the stock option at the date of grant and amortize that value as an expense to operations over the contractual vesting period 
the other option currently available to companies reporting under gaap is to estimate the fair value of the option at the grant date  but only reflect the impact of the amortization in a footnote to the financial statements and to forgo adjusting the statement of operations 
the method a company chooses to apply is a matter of policy 
consistent with our past practices  we utilize the second of these options and we reflect the impact of option amortization in the footnotes to our financial statements 
as illustrated in note to the financial statements  were we to change our accounting policy on this matter to reflect option expense in our statement of operations  or should gaap change to require us to reflect this expense in our statements of operations  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january fin r will be required for all enterprises with variable interests in variable interest entities vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   fin r will be applied beginning on january  with effective dates for public enterprises varying based on the type of vie  whether the public enterprise is a small business issuer  and whether the original interpretation issued in january was applied to a vie prior to the effective date of fin r 
for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie
