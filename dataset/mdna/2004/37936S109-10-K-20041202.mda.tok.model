critical accounting policies this management discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements which are prepared using certain critical accounting policies that require management to make judgments and estimates that are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty 
while we believe that these accounting policies  and management s judgments and estimates  are reasonable  actual future events can and often do result in outcomes that can be materially different from management s current judgments and estimates 
we believe that the accounting policies and related matters described in the paragraphs below are those that depend most heavily on management s judgments and estimates 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or net realizable value 
the company analyzes the net realizable value of its inventory on an ongoing basis 
in determining whether the net realizable value of its inventory is impaired  the company considers historical sales performance and expected future product sales  market conditions in which the company distributes its products  changes in product strategy and the potential for the introduction of new technology or products by the company and its competitors 
these items  as well as the introduction of new technology on products  could result in future inventory obsolescence 
capitalized software costs based upon achieving technological feasibility through a detailed program design for argus tm and aurora products  the company has capitalized the cost of software coding and development of these products  and reflects the amortization of these costs in cost of sales 
the annual amortization is calculated using the greater of a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
the estimation of both future sales of products as well as the life of the product are critical estimates that are affected by both internal and external factors that might affect the company s estimates 
if the useful life is reduced  or sales projections fall short of the estimation  amortization expense will increase 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers and the passage of title  including shipments to its unconsolidated affiliates  or at the time services are completed with respect to repairs not covered by warranty agreements 
with respect to sales to its unconsolidated affiliates  the company defers its pro rata share of gross profit on those sales until such time as its affiliates sell to a third party customer 
the timing of sales to affiliates can have an effect on the company s recognized profitability 
warranty policy the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time related sales revenue is recognized 
furthermore  the company warrants that its products are free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year  or almost two years relating to its argus and aurora products  from the date of initial purchase 
the warranty does not cover any losses or damage that occur as a result of improper installation  misuse or neglect and repair or modification by anyone other than the company and its appointed service centers 
repair costs beyond the warranty period are charged to the company s customers 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable at september   our accounts receivable balance was million

to the extent that our experience changes or our customers experience financial difficulty our reserve may need to increase 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates the company applies the equity method of accounting to its investments including advances in entities where the company has non controlling ownership interests of or less and exercises a significant influence on that entity 
the company s share of these affiliates earnings or losses is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company eliminates its pro rata share of gross profit on sales to its affiliates for inventory on hand at the affiliates at the end of the year 
for investments in which no public market exists  the company reviews the operating performance  financing and forecasts for such entities in assessing the net realizable values of these investments 
accordingly  the company recognized an impairment loss in fiscal totaling  for its net investment in the united kingdom based abacus financial management systems limited affiliate based upon the deterioration in that entity s financial condition

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the company adopted sfas no 
on october  the adoption of sfas did not affect the company s financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company accounted for long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of

 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach for financial reporting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes at the enacted rates at which these differences are expected to reverse 
the effective tax rate for the company is affected by the income mix derived from the core business and from its share of income from foreign affiliates that may have different tax rates 
realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the company s future profitability  and the company has  consequently  provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets due to the impact of the fiscal and losses and uncertainty as to the ability to generate future taxable income to sufficiently realize those assets 
to the extent the company s profitability improves  the valuation allowance may be wholly or partially reversed 
at such time that the company believes that it will realize sufficient taxable income the valuation allowance will be reassessed

as such  the interest rate is variable and the interest expense on potential borrowings is based upon the types of loans and applicable interest rates at the time of borrowing 
in the event the company had its entire revolving credit facility  million at september   outstanding for the entire year  each basis point increase would result in an annual increase in interest expense of approximately  the company has investments in privately held unconsolidated foreign companies for the purposes of conducting its business overseas and attaining its strategic objectives 
these investments have a net carrying value of million and million at september  and  respectively 
these investments are included in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and are accounted for using the equity method 
for investments in which no public market exists  our policy is to regularly review the operating performance  recent financing transactions and forecasts for such companies in assessing the net realizable values of the investments in these companies 
impairment losses on equity investments are recorded when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired and the decline in value is other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded  in impairment losses during the fourth quarter of fiscal
