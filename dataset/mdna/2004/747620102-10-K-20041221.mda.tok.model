included in the year over year increases were million for the year of net sales from the company s recent acquisitions of macsteel monroe and truseal 
demand at the vehicular products and building products segments remained strong throughout the year  and backlogs remained healthy at the end of the fiscal year 
income from continuing operations for the year ended october  was up over last year 
macsteel monroe s and truseal s combined earnings contributed after interest expense to earnings per share for the year months results 
also included in the results were lifo charges of million or per diluted share for the year 
this compares to a lifo charge of million  or per diluted share  for last year 
business segments business segments are reported in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that the company disclose certain information about its operating segments where operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
generally  financial information is required to be reported on the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments 
quanex has two market focused segments vehicular products and building products 
the vehicular products segment produces engineered steel products and extruded products for the light vehicle  heavy duty truck  agricultural  military  recreational and energy markets 
the vehicular products segment s main market drivers are north american light vehicle builds and  to a lesser extent  heavy duty truck builds 
the building products segment produces engineered products and aluminum sheet for window and door components used by the residential building and remodeling markets 
the main market drivers of this segment are residential housing starts and remodeling expenditures 
vehicular products three years ended october  the following table sets forth selected operating data for the vehicular products segment years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income operating income margin fiscal includes macsteel monroe s operations as of january  all periods presented exclude piper impact which is included in discontinued operations 
north american light vehicle builds were down about during the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the same period last year 
demand from the company s heavy duty truck customers was very strong again this quarter  with overall builds up approximately over the fiscal fourth quarter last year 
for the quarter ended october   the company s engineered steel bar operations ran at utilization rates near capacity 
fourth quarter and fiscal year operating income for the segment benefited from new customer programs  conversion cost improvements and the december  acquisition of macsteel monroe 
excluding the impact of macsteel monroe  net sales for fiscal were higher than fiscal by due to an increase in volume  combined with increased average prices of approximately in the form of scrap surcharges 
net sales for the segment increased from fiscal to fiscal due to a increase in volume and a increase in average prices 
strong demand in the segment has persisted over the past several years 
the strong demand  coupled with the company s ability to consistently improve productivity  have been the largest factors in the steady volume growth 
the average price increases realized over the last three years are primarily the result of two items 
first  the company is focused on increasing sales of the segment s value added macplus products 
this contributed to the increases from fiscal to and part of the increase from fiscal to the largest contributing factor for the increase from fiscal to is the overall price increases from higher steel scrap surcharges 
steel scrap prices increased dramatically over the latter half of calendar and all of fiscal as a result of the increases  surcharges came into effect beginning on january  and have been adjusted quarterly see further discussion of surcharge lag in commodity price risk of item a 
excluding the impact of macsteel monroe  operating income for fiscal increased above fiscal the sales volume and average sales price increases experienced during fiscal were able to more than offset the increased costs 
cost of sales increased coupled with a and increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  respectively  all exclusive of the acquisition 
the increase in the cost of sales was due primarily to the continued run up of raw material costs experienced within the segment 
raw material increases are also the principal factor for the reduced operating income in fiscal compared to the company was able to absorb more of the increase in fiscal than in because during fiscal raw materials increased  but did not exceed the minimum threshold that triggers the surcharges 
the surcharges did not become significant until january   and thus there was no real offset to higher raw material prices in the early stages of the run up 
the reduction of the operating income margin over the past three years is directly attributable to the raw material increases experienced over the past several years 
as raw material prices rise  the company experiences short term compression of the operating margin since the surcharges are adjusted on a quarterly basis based upon raw material indexes from the previous three months 
as raw material prices level off  the company would expect the vehicular products segment s operating income margin to improve initially 
declines in raw material costs will increase the margin in the short term as the surcharges lag behind 
building products three years ended october  the following table sets forth selected operating data for the building products segment years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income operating income margin fiscal includes truseal s operations as of january  all periods presented exclude nichols aluminum golden which is included in discontinued operations 
housing starts and remodeling activity during the company s fourth quarter were strong as demand at the window and door components businesses remained brisk 
the company s aluminum sheet business had an exceptionally robust fourth quarter 
while sales to the company s traditional building and construction customers remained excellent  sales to capital equipment  service center  and transportation customers were improved over last year 
a more favorable industry supply demand equation bolstered the company s spread 
excluding the impact of truseal  net sales for fiscal were higher than by 
the increase in net sales was a result of the increased volumes across the entire segment combined with an increase in aluminum sheet prices 
the increase in net sales from fiscal to is related to the february acquisition of colonial craft 
excluding the three additional months of net sales from colonial craft in fiscal  net sales actually declined slightly from fiscal due to the decision to exit low margin product lines 
the volume increase in fiscal was driven by strong demand in the building products market and new programs with fenestration customers 
the increase in aluminum sheet prices is a result of reduced industry capacity that put upward pressure on pricing 
excluding the impact of truseal  operating income for fiscal increased above fiscal the increase is a result of expenses growing to a lesser extent than net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal  while cost of sales increased by only 
this  coupled with increased volumes  led to strong growth in operating income for the year 
the reduction of operating income from fiscal to fiscal is a direct reflection of the higher prices paid for aluminum scrap  energy and outside processing combined with some production and quality problems encountered at one of the facilities in the building products segment 
the operating income margin declined from fiscal to fiscal as a result of the higher prices of raw materials discussed previously as well as the production and quality issues 
by the start of fiscal  the production and quality problems had been corrected and demand increased such that the upward price pressure realized in the market was able to stay ahead of the increasing raw material costs 
the associated margin expansion realized during fiscal coupled with the volume increases resulted in further expansion of the operating income margin 
the acquisition of truseal during fiscal contributed slightly to the increased margin realized in corporate and other three years ended october  years ended october  change dollars in millions vs 
vs 
cost of sales selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of land operating income expense corporate and other operating expenses  not included in the two operating segments mentioned above  include the consolidated lifo inventory adjustments calculated on a combined pool basis  corporate office expenses and inter segment eliminations 
the increase in raw material costs experienced during fiscal and resulted in increased expense each year associated with increasing the lifo inventory reserve 
for the years ended october   and  the amount of lifo inventory adjustment expensed was million  million and million  respectively 
changes associated with the lifo inventory adjustment tend to comprise a majority of the change from year to year in corporate and other expenses 
during fiscal  corporate and other expenses increased as a result of increased professional services related to the implementation of various procedures arising from the sarbanes oxley act of beginning in fiscal interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million from fiscal and million in fiscal the increase from to is a result of an increase in the average debt outstanding for the comparative period that is primarily attributable to the acquisitions that were completed in the first quarter of fiscal other  net on the income statement for fiscal was income of million compared to income of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change from to is related to million less of income associated with the cash surrender value of life insurance  net of the change in the liability for supplemental retirement  combined with million of additional expenses recognized in fiscal for deferred compensation as a direct result of the increase in the company s stock price 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes for fiscal was a loss of million compared to a loss of million for fiscal and income of million for fiscal the increased loss from fiscal to fiscal is related to the million loss on sale of nichols aluminum golden combined with the net million write down of piper impact 
the decrease from to is primarily related to the erosion of demand for piper impact s airbag components 
see note for further information regarding the composition of discontinued operations 
outlook overall  customer demand in the company s two target markets  vehicular products and building products  is expected to remain strong in vehicular products segment north american light vehicle builds are expected to be approximately million builds  essentially flat to heavy duty truck builds for are expected to be up significantly over levels while secondary markets are also expected to remain at high levels 
building products segment key market drivers are expected to remain healthy in housing starts are expected to be off approximately from s record levels  while remodeling activity is expected to remain very strong 
quanex expects to post improved results in fiscal compared to fiscal this expectation is based on an improving economy  market share gains at both operating segments and the earnings benefit from the acquisitions of macsteel monroe and truseal 
the earnings outlook for the first quarter remains favorable 
the company expects first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of to  up from the reported in the first quarter of quanex cautions that the combination of short cycle businesses and volatile raw material input costs makes forecasting problematic 
liquidity and capital resources sources of funds the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under its secured million revolving credit agreement bank agreement 
at october   the company had no borrowings under the bank agreement 
this represents a million decrease from october  borrowing levels 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company s borrowings under the bank agreement increased million in order to fund the acquisitions of macsteel monroe and truseal 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company issued million of convertible senior debentures due may  the debentures 
the company used approximately million of proceeds from the issuance of the debentures to repay a portion of what was then outstanding under the bank agreement 
the company repaid the remainder of the outstanding balance throughout fiscal using cash flow from operations 
the company believes that it has sufficient funds and adequate financial sources available to meet its anticipated liquidity needs 
the company also believes that cash flow from operations  cash balances and available borrowings will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to finance anticipated working capital requirements  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  environmental expenditures  dividends and the stock purchase program 
the company s working capital was million at october  compared to million at october  million of the million total increase in working capital is associated with the non recurring transactions that occurred during fiscal a million increase related to the macsteel monroe and truseal acquisitions offset by a million decrease from the nichols aluminum golden divestiture 
excluding the impact of the above referenced transactions  working capital increased million  primarily a result of the million increase in cash and equivalents 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of lower working capital requirements  whereas the increase from fiscal to fiscal is primarily attributable to the million increase in income from continuing operations 
accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable were impacted significantly by the increase in raw material prices experienced throughout fiscal and while the run up in raw material costs increased inventory prices  the company was successful in reducing overall inventory volumes  which helped to keep total working capital in line with the previous year 
investment activities net cash used for investment activities during the year ended october  was million compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
investment activities for the year ended october  included the acquisition of macsteel monroe for million and truseal for million 
the cost of the acquisitions was partially offset by the million received from the sale of nichols aluminum golden 
the company expects to receive proceeds from the sale of piper impact in fiscal see note for further explanation 
capital expenditures have decreased steadily over the last three years from million in fiscal to million in fiscal to million in fiscal in light of the announcement in september of the million phase viii expansion at the macsteel arkansas facility  the company expects capital expenditures to increase to approximately million 
at october   the company had commitments of approximately million for the purchase or construction of capital assets 
the company plans to fund these capital expenditures through cash flow from operations 
the final contributing factor to the increased use of cash from investing activities is the proceeds received from company owned life insurance policies and property sales 
in  proceeds from such items totaled million  which is million more than was received during fiscal financing activities cash from financing activities for the year ended october  was a source of cash of million compared to uses of cash in both and of million and million  respectively 
the most significant contributing factor to the increase is the million of borrowings that occurred in the first quarter of that were used to fund the macsteel monroe and truseal acquisitions 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company used approximately million of proceeds from the issuance of the debentures to repay a portion of what was then outstanding under the bank agreement 
it is important to note that apart from the reduction through the debenture offering  the company repaid approximately million of the bank agreement during compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on august   the board of directors of the company increased the quarterly dividend from to per common share outstanding 
this increase was effective with the company s third quarter dividend paid on september  while the impact of the dividend change resulted in an increase of roughly million in dividends paid  this increase was more than offset by the million increase in proceeds received from stock issuances related to the exercise of stock options 
total amounts paid for dividends will increase in fiscal since there was only a single dividend distribution in fiscal following the increase in the quarterly dividend

critical accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be perceived with certainty 
estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information becomes available and as the company s operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from estimates 
the company believes the following are the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements as well as the significant judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
inherent in the company s revenue recognition policy is the determination of collectibility 
this requires management to make frequent judgments and estimates in order to determine the appropriate amount of allowance needed for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
this allowance is maintained at a level the company considers appropriate based on historical and other factors that affect collectibility 
these factors include historical trends of write offs  recoveries and credit losses  the careful monitoring of portfolio credit quality  and projected economic and market conditions 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to the allowance 
inventory the company records inventory valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the company s forecast of future demand and market conditions 
significant unanticipated changes to the company s forecasts could require a change in the provision for excess or obsolete inventory 
environmental contingencies quanex is subject to extensive laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment and the remediation of chemical contamination 
to satisfy such requirements  quanex must make capital and other expenditures on an ongoing basis 
the company accrues its best estimates of its remediation obligations and adjusts such accruals as further information and circumstances develop 
those estimates may change substantially depending on information about the nature and extent of contamination  appropriate remediation technologies  and regulatory approvals 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation are not discounted to their present value  unless the amount and timing of the expenditures are fixed or reliably determinable 
when environmental laws might be deemed to impose joint and several liability for the costs of responding to contamination  the company accrues its allocable share of liability taking into account the number of parties participating  their ability to pay their shares  the volumes and nature of the wastes involved  the nature of anticipated response actions  and the nature of the company s alleged connections 
unanticipated changes of future assessments and or regulatory laws could result in expenses being incurred in future periods in addition to an increase in actual cash required to remediate the contamination 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  other intangibles  and other assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment and further reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired 
the carrying values are compared with the fair value of such assets calculated based on the anticipated future cash flows related to those assets 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and future market conditions 
future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
goodwill the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the company to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually as of august in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that a potential impairment exists 
the impairment test requires the company to compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value including assigned goodwill 
the company primarily uses the present value of future cash flows to determine fair value and validates the result against the cost and market approaches 
future cash flows are typically based upon a five year future period for the businesses and an estimated residual value 
management judgment is required in the estimation of future operating results and to determine the appropriate residual values 
the residual values are determined from comparable industry transactions 
future operating results and residual values could reasonably differ from the estimates and could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes the company records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the company s consolidated balance sheet  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the carrying value of the net deferred tax liability reflects the company s assumption that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize its deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against a portion of its deferred tax assets 
this could result in additional income tax expense in a future period in the consolidated statement of income 
insurance the company manages its costs for portions of workers compensation  group medical  general liability and vehicle liability exposure through a combination of retentions and insurance coverage 
the amounts in excess of the retention levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with the company s portion of these exposures are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other assumptions 
projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
retirement and pension plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded postretirement plan that provides health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate  which is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities  is applied against the projected pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset investment performance will either reduce or increase unamortized pension losses at the end of any fiscal year  which ultimately affects future pension costs 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company presents the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of operations that have either been sold or that meet the criteria for held for sale accounting as discontinued operations 
at the time an operation qualifies for held for sale accounting  the operation is evaluated to determine whether or not the carrying value exceeds its fair value less cost to sell 
any loss as a result of carrying value in excess of fair value less cost to sell is recorded in the period the operation meets held for sale accounting 
management judgment is required to assess the criteria required to meet held for sale accounting  and estimate fair value 
changes to the operation could cause it to no longer qualify for held for sale accounting and changes to fair value could result in an increase or decrease to previously recognized losses 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the revised sfas no 
retains the disclosures required by the original issuance of sfas no 
and requires additional annual disclosures describing the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date  plan obligations  and cash flows 
the company included the revised sfas no 
annual disclosures in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending october  the revised sfas no 
also requires additional interim period disclosures  including the components of net periodic benefit cost and changes in planned contributions 
the company included the required disclosures in the notes to the interim financial statements beginning with the second quarter of fiscal in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effects on diluted earnings per share  which was ratified by the fasb in october issue becomes effective for periods after december   which will be the company s first fiscal quarter of under the consensus  companies will be required to retroactively restate diluted earnings per share numbers applying the if converted method of accounting from the issuance date of the contingently convertible bond 
on may   the company issued million of convertible senior debentures due may  as it relates to quanex  eitf issue would mean an additional million shares of earnings dilution and have an annualized earnings per share impact of approximately per common share 
however  the company could elect to settle its convertible obligation with either common stock  cash or a combination of the two 
if the company elects to settle its entire convertible obligation with cash and can demonstrate its ability to do so  it would not be required to show the dilutive impact of the higher share count in the calculation of its earnings per share for periods after such election 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of the company and its subsidiaries exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing certain assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to the company 
nevertheless  because of the inherent unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates and metal commodity prices as well as other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward looking information 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
for a description of the company s significant accounting policies associated with these activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries have a bank agreement and other long term debt which subject the company to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
at october  and  the company had fixed rate debt totaling million and million  respectively 
this debt is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries floating rate obligations totaled million and million at october  and  respectively 
based on the floating rate obligations outstanding at october   a one percent increase or decrease in the average interest rate would result in a change to pre tax interest expense of approximately for  the company had million of swap agreements in place to limit the exposure of this obligation to increases in short term interest rates 
these swap agreements effectively fixed the interest rate  thus limiting the potential impact that increasing interest rates would have on earnings 
under these swap agreements  payments were made based on a fixed rate million at  and million at and received on a libor based variable rate at october  
at october   the fair market value related to the interest rate swap agreements was a loss of million 
to the extent that floating rate obligations are in excess of or less than million  the company was subject to changes in the underlying interest rates 
for the year ended october   the company s floating rate obligations were million less than the million swap agreement 
increases or decreases in the underlying interest rate of the swap agreement would have had a direct impact on interest expense for this differential in balances 
these swap agreements expired on july  and the final settlement payment was made 
the company has not entered into any other interest swap agreements and as such is subject to the variability of interest rates on its variable rate debt 
commodity price risk the vehicular products segment has a scrap surcharge program in place  which is a practice that is well established within the engineered steel bar industry 
the scrap surcharge is based on a three month trailing average of bundle scrap prices 
the company s long term exposure to changes in scrap prices is significantly reduced because of the surcharge program 
over time  the company recovers the majority of its scrap cost increases  though there is a level of exposure to short term volatility because of the three month lag 
within the building products segment  the company uses various grades of aluminum scrap as well as minimal amounts of prime aluminum ingot as raw materials for its manufacturing process 
the price of this aluminum raw material is subject to fluctuations due to many factors in the aluminum market 
in the normal course of business  nichols aluminum enters into firm price sales commitments with its customers 
in an effort to reduce the risk of fluctuating raw material prices  the company enters into firm price raw material purchase commitments which are designated as normal purchases under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as well as option contracts on the london metal exchange lme 
the company s risk management policy as it relates to these lme contracts is to enter into contracts to cover the raw material needs of the company s committed sales orders  net of fixed price purchase commitments 
through the use of firm price raw material purchase commitments and lme contracts  the company intends to protect cost of sales from the effects of changing prices of aluminum 
to the extent that the raw material costs factored into the firm price sales commitments are matched with firm price raw material purchase commitments  changes in aluminum prices should have no effect 
during fiscal  the company primarily relied upon firm price raw material purchase commitments to protect cost of sales tied to firm price sales commitments 
there were no outstanding lme hedges as of october
