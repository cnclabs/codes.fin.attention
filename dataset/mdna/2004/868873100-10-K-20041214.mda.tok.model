item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 

table of contents overview surmodics is a leading provider of surface modification and drug delivery technologies to the medical device industry 
the company is organized into five technology centered business units 
the operating results from three of the business units are combined into one operating segment  hydrophilic and other as explained below 
each of the two remaining business units constitutes an operating segment 
the drug delivery operating segment contains the drug delivery business unit  which is responsible for technologies dedicated to site specific delivery of drugs 
the hydrophilic and other operating segment consists of three business units hydrophilic technologies unit which focuses on enhancing medical devices with advanced lubricious coatings that facilitate their placement and maneuverability in the body  regenerative technologies unit which encompasses the company s hemocompatibility  tissue engineering and cell encapsulation technologies  and surmodics new ventures unit which is dedicated to the identification  research and development of new technologies outside the research conducted in the other business units 
the diagnostics operating segment contains the diagnostics and drug discovery business unit which includes the company s genomics and slide technologies  the company s stabilization products for immunoassay diagnostics test  and its in vitro diagnostic format technology 
revenue in each of our operating segments is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our patented surface modification technologies to customers  the sale of reagent chemicals to licensees of our coating technologies  stabilization products to the diagnostics industry and coated glass slides to the genomics market  and research and development fees generated on projects for commercial customers 
revenue should be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our coating technologies  the timing of introductions of coated products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers  the number and size of development projects that are entered into  the number of new license agreements that are finalized  and the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to licensees 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we treat our three operating segments as one reportable segment 
we made this determination because each of our operating segments use the same facilities  a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to each operating segment  technology and products from each operating segment are marketed to the same or similar customers  each operating segment uses the same sales and marketing resources and each operating segment operates in the same regulatory environment 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are the critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with the report 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon the achievement of the milestone  as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue on sales of the company s products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met 
table of contents at the time our product is shipped 
revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value was less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment loss 
on june   the company announced that it expected to record an asset impairment charge against its bloomington  minnesota contract manufacturing facility 
results in the third quarter of fiscal include a non cash asset impairment charge of million 
the company engaged several commercial real estate brokerage firms to assess the market valuation of similar types of commercial property 
management determined the fair value using this real estate market data 
the company is seeking to sell or lease the bloomington facility and will consolidate operations of all business units at its eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities 
the company s policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
investments are classified as available for sale  that is  investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
results of operations years ended september  and increase increase dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal decrease decrease revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other diagnostics total revenue revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of over fiscal the growth in total revenue was attributable to growth in our drug delivery and hydrophilic and other segments as detailed in the table above 
we provide a narrative of revenue for each of our three operating segments in the paragraphs that follow 
drug delivery 
drug delivery revenue increased to million in fiscal drug delivery derives a substantial majority of its revenue from all three primary sources royalties and license fees  product sales and research and development fees from cordis corporation a johnson johnson company on its cypher stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 

table of contents fiscal drug delivery revenue growth was attributable to a significant increase in royalties and license fees compared with the prior year 
cordis cypher stent received us fda approval in april our prior year third fiscal quarter 
accordingly  results reflect a full year of cypher sales in the united states  whereas fiscal results include us sales of cypher for slightly less than months 
this increase in royalties and license fees more than offset a significant reduction in research and development revenue and a decrease in sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices 
research and development revenue decreased in principally as a result of the lower level of clinical coating work following fda approval of cypher 
we continue to provide development services to cordis and other drug delivery customers  but on a smaller scale than that provided to cordis in although cordis purchased a substantial majority of reagents sold in fiscal  reagent chemical sales to cordis decreased in as both volume and unit prices decreased 
in fiscal  we expect a significant decrease in reagent chemical sales to cordis as a result of a contractual reduction in reagent pricing and as cordis continues to become more efficient in its manufacturing  and possibly lower cypher sales as a result of boston scientific corporation having its taxus drug eluting stent available for sale in the us for our full fiscal year as opposed to only a portion of our fiscal year 
boston scientific was granted approval by the fda to begin marketing in the us its taxus drug eluting stent in our second fiscal quarter 
the boston scientific stent competes directly with the cypher stent and gained market share leadership during the year 
the market for all drug eluting stents in the united states grew substantially in fiscal we anticipate that while the overall market for drug eluting stents will continue to grow  quarterly royalty revenue from the current generation cypher stent will be volatile as the two sole us marketers of drug eluting stents compete in the marketplace 
management expects royalties from the cypher stent to constitute a significant portion of our revenue throughout fiscal cordis cypher stent was approved for sale in japan in fiscal  and was launched in our fourth fiscal quarter 
increased reimbursement for japanese cypher sales went into effect in october our fiscal 
cypher is expected to be the sole drug eluting stent available for sale in japan until the second half of calendar based on public disclosure by boston scientific that approval for sale of taxus stent in japan is not expected until such time 
there is currently pending litigation involving boston scientific scimed  inc and cordis in us district court for the district of delaware in which each alleges its patent rights are being infringed by the other s drug eluting stent  and each has been denied the preliminary injunction it has requested against the other 
the companies are scheduled for trial in june hydrophilic and other 
in fiscal  overall hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  with growth contributed from all three primary revenue sources 
royalties and license fees increased modestly compared with fiscal while a significant percentage of revenue in drug delivery is attributable to cordis  in hydrophilic and other there are several dozen licensees and even more coated products generating royalties 
sales of reagent chemicals for hydrophilic and other increased substantially from fiscal management expects continued growth in hydrophilic and other but growth in fiscal is unlikely to be as strong as it was in diagnostics 
diagnostics derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
overall fiscal revenue decreased about to million with nearly all of the decrease caused by lower royalties from ge healthcare stemming from scheduled contractual royalty decreases 
in addition  fiscal results include a  payment related to the achievement of a 
table of contents technical milestone while results include a similar milestone payment of  historical growth in diagnostics may not be indicative of future results in light of discussions concerning possible renegotiation of certain agreements 
offsetting this uncertainty is an expected increase in royalty revenue resulting from the company s purchase at the end of fiscal of the future royalty stream under certain sublicenses for which the company previously has been receiving only a portion of the sublicense royalties 
product costs 
the company s product costs were million for fiscal  an increase of  from the million recorded in fiscal overall product margins averaged  a decrease from the margins in fiscal higher cost non cordis reagents made up a higher percentage of total product sales in fiscal management continues to expect downward pressure on margins in fiscal resulting from the seracare stabilization product distribution agreement signed in the second quarter of fiscal and a contractual reduction in reagent prices for cordis 
research and development expense 
research and development expense for fiscal was million  an increase of  or  compared with the same period in fiscal management believes research and development expense will increase modestly in as the company makes increased investments in research and development and resulting from the amortization cost associated with the recently purchased sublicense royalty stream discussed above in diagnostics 
some of this increased spending will be partially offset by lower depreciation expense on the bloomington facility 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal a substantial portion of the decrease resulted from lower payroll costs related to a reduction in senior marketing personnel in connection with a company wide reorganization 
management anticipates increased sales and marketing expense in fiscal as the company expands the size of its sales force 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  compared with fiscal the decrease reflects efficiencies gained in the reorganization as well as lower legal costs 
management anticipates general and administrative expense will increase modestly in fiscal asset impairment charge 
results in fiscal included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against our bloomington  minnesota contract manufacturing facility 
in order to determine the fair value of the facility  the company engaged several commercial real estate brokerage firms to assess the market valuation of similar types of commercial property among other data and factors 
the company is seeking to sell or lease the bloomington facility and plans to consolidate operations at its eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
other income  net 
the company s other income was million for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from fiscal investment income decreased as a result of lower investment yields and the early payoff of a million note receivable 
in addition  much of the decrease reflects lower capital gains generated from our investment portfolio 
in fiscal  the company s investment advisor sold and reinvested a portion of the company s bond portfolio generating gains of  results in fiscal reflect approximately  in gains from such sales 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal 
table of contents years ended september  and increase increase dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal decrease decrease revenue drug delivery hydrophilic and other diagnostics total revenue revenue 
the company s total revenue was million in fiscal  an increase of over fiscal the majority of the overall growth came from our drug delivery segment as detailed in the table above 
we provide a narrative of revenue for each of our three operating segments in the paragraphs that follow 
drug delivery 
in fiscal  drug delivery revenue increased to million 
substantially all of this total revenue increase in fiscal reflects the growth in royalties and license fees resulting primarily from the royalty obligations of cordis on its cypher stent 
in april the third quarter of our fiscal year  cordis received us food and drug administration fda approval to begin marketing its cypher stent in the us sales of reagent chemicals increased significantly as a result of increased demand by cordis in support of their cypher stent manufacturing 
the third source of drug delivery revenue  research and development fees  decreased principally reflecting the lower level of clinical coating work following fda approval of cypher 
hydrophilic and other 
overall revenue for this segment increased to million in fiscal the increase includes a royalty back payment of million on product sales by a single licensee recorded in the third quarter of and a non performing license we cancelled in the first quarter of fiscal that resulted in the recognition of approximately  of deferred license fee revenue 
diagnostics 
overall revenue for this segment increased to million in fiscal all three revenue sources contributed to the growth  which included an increase in minimum royalties from amersham plc now ge healthcare on its coated glass slide and a  milestone payment from amersham plc for a product that it introduced to the market during the third quarter of product costs 
the company s product costs were million for fiscal  a decrease of  from the million recorded in fiscal overall product margins averaged  a significant increase from the margins in fiscal attributable in part to reduced scrap costs but mostly to the fact that higher margin reagent product sales constituted an even greater percentage of total product sales than in fiscal research and development expense 
research and development expense for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  compared with the same period in fiscal the increase primarily reflects compensation and benefits associated with technical personnel we added during fiscal and increased depreciation and facilities expenses 
we moved segments of our research and development activities to a portion of the bloomington contract manufacturing facility early in fiscal year  which increased depreciation expense attributable to research and development 

table of contents sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense was million for fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal the increase reflects higher promotional costs  increased compensation  benefits  and business travel related to marketing personnel added in fiscal and licensing costs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily a result of costs associated with contract negotiations and a increase in directors and officers insurance 
other income  net 
the company s other income was million for fiscal  an increase of  or  from fiscal interest earned on our investments decreased to million mostly because of lower yields 
income tax expense 
the company s income tax provision was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal  a slight increase from in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had working capital of million and cash  cash equivalents and investments marketable securities totaling million 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are three years or less 
the company s policy requires that no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
the primary investment objective of the portfolio is to provide for the safety of principal and appropriate liquidity while generating an above benchmark lehman brothers year government index total rate of return 
management plans to continue to direct its investment advisor to manage the company s investments primarily for the safety of principal for the foreseeable future as it assesses other investment opportunities and uses of its investments 
the company generated positive cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows in fiscal primarily reflects the increased net income generated during the year  net of the asset impairment charge and the related deferred taxes 
in october  the company purchased a facility in bloomington  minnesota  situated on acres of land 
as part of a reorganization  we announced in june that after careful examination of our redefined business goals  we determined that the bloomington contract manufacturing facility was not necessary for the execution of our strategic plan 
management believes the company has adequate office space and manufacturing capacity in its eden prairie headquarters to support its business and strategic plan 
accordingly  results in the third quarter of fiscal included a non cash asset impairment charge of million 
the company is seeking to sell or lease the bloomington facility and plans to consolidate operations at its eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
in october  the company received prepayment of approximately million due on a note receivable related to property the company sold in june with this payment  the note was paid in its entirety 
in february  the company invested million in innorx  inc  an alabama based  early stage company developing unique drug delivery devices and therapies for the ophthalmology market 
the 
table of contents company invested an additional million in october our fiscal and has agreed to invest a total of million  the remaining million of which will be invested subject to innorx completing a regulatory milestone 
we expect that such milestone investment will be made in december in collaboration with the company  innorx is developing a patented  implantable coil to deliver therapeutic agents in the eye to treat various retinal diseases 
this product utilizes surmodics site specific drug delivery technology 
while the company anticipates that its investment in innorx will help facilitate the commercialization of its technology and result in revenue for the company in the future  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
innorx s primary technology is in its development stage  and we anticipate that it will be years before commercialization may be realized 
the company s investment in innorx is accounted for under the cost method and the total million to be invested represents an ownership interest of less than 
in february  the company loaned  to novocell  inc  a privately held irvine  california based biotech firm that is developing a unique treatment for diabetes using cell encapsulation 
in august  the loan was converted into equity 
to date  the company has invested a total of million in novocell 
working with novocell  the company s researchers have created a coating that encapsulates pancreatic islet cells the cells that produce insulin in the human body 
if successful  this treatment using coated islet cells could dramatically change the treatment of diabetes 
while the company anticipates that its investment in novocell will help facilitate the commercialization of its technology and result in revenue for the company in the future  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
novocell s primary technology is in its development stage  and we anticipate that it will be years before commercialization may be realized 
the million investment  which is accounted for under the cost method  is included in other assets and represents an ownership interest of less than risks and uncertainties surrounding a development stage company s ability to obtain on a timely and frequent basis financing needed to continue its development activities currently affect  and will continually affect  the prospects of the company s investments in novocell and innorx and the revenue they may ultimately generate 
neither of these companies has full funding for its development activities 
there is no assurance that novocell s current efforts to meet its immediate financing needs will be successful or that future financing needs of novocell or innorx will be met when required 
if adverse results occur in novocell s or innorx s development of its respective technology or if its financing needs are not continually met  the viability of such company and its efforts in providing a future revenue source for the company will be in jeopardy and the company s investment in such company would likely be considered impaired and charged against the company s earnings at such time 
in september  we made a commitment to purchase for million certain additional sublicense rights and the accompanying future royalty revenue streams under certain sublicenses through an amendment to our diagnostic format patent license with abbott laboratories 
prior to such amendment  we were receiving only a portion of the royalties under such sublicenses 
the first million installment was paid in november our fiscal 
the remaining installments are reflected in other long term liabilities in the september  balance sheets 
as of september   the company had no debt  nor did it have any credit agreements 
the company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate to fund its operations into the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements at september  or during the year then ended 

table of contents contractual obligations presented below is a summary of contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments 
we do not have any long term debt or any capital or operating leases 
see notes to financial statements for additional information regarding the below obligations and commitments 
maturity by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter in millions other long term liabilities reflected on balance sheet under gaap total new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on the remaining portions of eitf  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  with an effective date of june  eitf provides new disclosure requirements for other than temporary impairments on debt and equity investments 
investors are required to disclose quantitative information about i the aggregate amount of unrealized losses  and ii the aggregate related fair values of investments with unrealized losses  segregated into time periods during which the investment has been in an unrealized loss position of less than months and greater than months 
in addition  investors are required to disclose the qualitative information that supports their conclusion that the impairments noted in the qualitative disclosure are not other than temporary 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp  which provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of for employers that sponsor postretirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits 
fsp supersedes fsp that was issued in january under the same title 
fsp is effective for the first interim period beginning after june  the company does not sponsor a postretirement healthcare plan so fsp did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage 
table of contents interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
