item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
overview rock of ages is an integrated quarrier  manufacturer  distributor and retailer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
during  we had four business segments  quarrying  manufacturing  retail and cemeteries 
the quarry division sells granite blocks both to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sells granite memorials directly to consumers 
the cemetery division sells cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
on december   we sold all of our cemetery properties and assets to saber management  llc for  thereby exiting the cemetery business 
we recorded a gain of  in after taxes  accounted for as a sale of discontinued operations 
our quarry division s results were negatively impacted by a decrease in saleable stone from our pennsylvania black quarry due to poor geological formations ie cracks and other abnormalities in the current area of the quarry 
these conditions may be encountered from time to time in quarry operations 
we believe yields in the pennsylvania black quarry should improve during as we work through the formation 
results were also negatively impacted by a sharp increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily caused by the increase in legal fees and expenses in connection with the eurimex arbitration see item legal proceedings 
proceedings of this nature and magnitude have historically been rare and we do not expect these levels of expenditures to be a recurring part of our business 
on the positive side  the bethel white quarry continued to have very good production and yield as well as strong demand during our manufacturing division had a good year  and benefited from a slight increase in the shipments of mausoleums and other larger  estate and feature memorials  which generally have higher than average profit margins 
we also benefited from strong outsourcing relationships for certain colors of granite and some lower end products 
the current climate for manufacturing is very competitive  with imported products becoming more and more common 
we continue to explore outsourcing relationships with importers  and we also plan to increase the amount of capital investments in our manufacturing plants in to increase productivity  reduce costs and continue to meet demand for our products 
during  we continued to focus on our strategy of building a profitable retail distribution system 
was a challenging year for retail 
we experienced declining revenues as well as a decline in total units sold  and higher than anticipated sales costs 
we believe some of the declines may be due to a difficult economy in early and a colder than normal winter season  events that are difficult to predict and control 
we have been working and continue to work on increasing sales and units sold  as well as controlling sales costs by focusing on factors we can control 
we are exploring and implementing a number of initiatives to increase distribution of our products  both through our owned stores as well as through independent authorized retailers and funeral homes and cemeteries 
as discussed in item of this annual report on form k  we are also in the process of merging our retail division with our manufacturing and wholesale division to form the memorials division  with a unified focus on increasing our retail distribution system 
we believe the changes we are implementing and will continue to implement throughout will enhance our ability to increase the revenue and profitability of our market share through an expanded distribution system 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred income taxes  contingencies and accounting for pensions 
revenue recognition the company records revenues from quarrying  manufacturing  retailing and cemeteries 
quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped from the quarry 
we provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and request that we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from blocks purchased when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site and the customer requests the block be stored 
at that time  the block is removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the selling price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special december payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately mid march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  the quarry customers manufacturing plants remain open  and many prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing rock of ages does not record a sale  nor do we record gross profit  at the time granite is transferred to the manufacturing division from our quarries 
we record revenue and gross profit related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities 
manufacturing revenues related to internally transferred finished products to our owned retail outlets are recorded when ultimately sold at retail to an outside customer 
retail retailing revenues are recorded when the finished monument is set in the cemetery 
in certain instances  we may enter into an agreement with a customer that provides for extended payments terms  generally up to two years from either the date of setting the memorial or  in certain instances  upon the settlement of an estate 
cemetery division the cemetery division s revenue from preneed sales of funeral services  and cemetery services and merchandise is deferred until the period in which the services or merchandise is delivered 
on the balance sheet the full contract amount is included in prearranged deferred revenue  a liability 
the corresponding receivable due from the customer is reflected in prearranged receivables  an asset  and the corresponding cash received from the customer is reflected partly in prearranged receivables for the portion placed in trust and partly in cash for the portion the company is allowed to retain 
indirect costs of marketing are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
when the service or merchandise is delivered  we recognize as revenue the full contract amount plus all trust earnings associated with that contract 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and  prior to  goodwill 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of its depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our services  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to integrate acquired companies and achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
effective january   we assessed impairment of goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require a two step test be performed 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit will be compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  then the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 we determined the fair value of each of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated goodwill recorded in the retail and cemetery segments was impaired as of january  accordingly  we completed the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss  and recognized a million non cash charge  recorded as of january   as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
approximately million of the goodwill write down is deductible for taxes 
therefore a deferred tax asset of million has been recorded 
there were two major factors that contributed to the goodwill impairment in the retail segment 
first  we underestimated the amount of time required to fully integrate the branding strategy through the retail network 
second  we had difficulty increasing profitability in the timeframe expected and to the extent we anticipated prior to the retail acquisitions 
the major factors that contributed to the goodwill impairment in the cemetery segment were lower than expected revenues and greater than expected selling and administrative costs 
in december  we decided to sell the autumn rose quarry in mill creek  oklahoma 
accordingly  it is now classified as assets held for sale in the accompanying balance sheet 
we have determined the carrying value of the quarry exceeded its fair value based on discussions with interested parties 
as a result  we recognized an after tax impairment charge of approximately  in the th quarter of  which decreased the carrying value to our best estimate of the fair value of the quarry 
we will continue to actively search for a buyer for this quarry and believe our estimate of the fair value is accurate 
however  if the ultimate negotiated price for the quarry is below our estimate of fair value  further impairment charges may be required and future operating results could be materially impacted 
we have entered into arrangements whereby we accepted a promissory note as partial or full payment for certain transactions  particularly the sale of an operation 
such notes have varying terms with principle and interest paid to the company over a period of generally not more than years 
while most notes are secured by an interest in real property and or assets  management must make estimates and judgments as to the collectibility of such promissory notes 
such judgments depend on many factors including current and future economic conditions  the financial condition of the debtor as well as our estimate of the net realizable value of the security interest securing the note 
we believe we have accurately assessed the collectibility of these assets  however  the above factors and other factors may cause our accounting estimates concerning the collectibility of the notes to change and future operating results could be materially impacted 
valuation of deferred income taxes as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  against the alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards and other deferred tax assets 
based upon the projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not we will realize the benefit of these unreserved net deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
contingencies we are involved in various types of legal proceedings from time to time 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and risks  including  but not limited to  court rulings  judgments  negotiations between affected parties and government action 
management  with the assistance of its outside advisors  assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
as described in item legal proceedings  we are currently involved in an icc arbitration proceeding in which eurimex  our former distributor outside the united states  has brought claims against us alleging  among other things  breach of contract and violation of antitrust laws under the european community treaty 
we believe the claims are without merit and we will prevail in this case 
accordingly  we have not accrued a reserve for adverse judgment 
however  if the arbitral tribunal were to decide in favor of eurimex and award substantial damages  our business and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for pensions we provide defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of our employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets and discount rates 
in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing gross profit  which are shown as a percentage of quarrying  manufacturing and retailing revenues  respectively 
year ended december  statement of operations data net revenues quarrying manufacturing retailing total net revenues gross profit quarrying manufacturing retailing total gross profit selling  general administrative expenses loss on disposal of assets income from continuing operations interest expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles discontinued operations income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue was down  gross profit declined and total selling  general and administrative sg a costs increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  were down from the same period last year primarily as a result of lower shipments from our pennsylvania black and barre gray quarries 
these lower shipments were partially offset by increased shipments from the bethel white quarry 
our pennsylvania black quarry had decreased revenues because of low yields  which means we had lower than normal recoveries of saleable granite 
this decreased the quantity of granite available for sale 
we believe yields will improve in as we work through the problematic part of the geological formation 
this should lead to increased revenues  as we believe demand for pennsylvania black remains good 
from time to time  we may experience a decrease in yield at any one of our quarries due to natural variations in the geological formations of the quarry 
historically  these issues have generally been temporary in nature  and are resolved as the geological formation is worked and or new areas of the quarry are opened 
our barre gray quarry revenues have declined in large part due to the increasing consumer demand for colored granites  which has displaced sales of the traditional gray granite 
while barre gray remains one of the world s finest granites and is very desirable in many markets  we expect sales of barre gray will remain flat or decline as imported and other colored granites capture greater market share 
revenues from the bethel white quarry increased as a result of very strong export customer demand as well as good quarry yields 
we believe bethel white revenues will stay strong in as demand appears to be very good and the quarry is in good condition to maximize yields 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  decreased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to from the same period last year 
the primary reason for the decrease in gross profit was the decrease in revenue and higher quarrying costs resulting from low yields from our pennsylvania black quarry 
this was partially offset by the increase in revenue from our bethel white quarry 
gross profit was affected to a lesser degree by increased productivity and higher gross margins in the barre gray quarry which was offset by lower gross margins in the salisbury pink quarry as a result of decreased pricing required in an effort to decrease inventory and develop new markets for that stone 
sg a costs in our quarry segment for increased from primarily due to an additional  in legal expenses associated with the eurimex arbitration discussed in item legal proceedings 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased over the same period last year 
this was primarily due to increased shipments of mausoleums and estate memorials  which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from the national world war ii memorial being constructed in washington  d 
c which was completed in compared to we have received increased order receipts for mausoleums and estate memorials and expect orders for those products to continue to be strong during while we have added staff and increased our marketing efforts to increase the number of mausoleums and estate memorials sold  demand for these products has historically been cyclical and we cannot predict with certainty whether orders for mausoleums and larger estate memorials will continue to grow  level off  or decline in the long run 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group increased and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
the slight increase is consistent with the general improvement in the quality of orders in the division  including larger and more expensive memorials  mausoleums and estate memorials 
sg a costs for the manufacturing group were up over last year 
roughly half of this increase is a result of unfavorable currency exchange effects of the weakening us dollar on our canadian manufacturing operations and the balance is from several smaller increases  including an increase in the cost of employee benefits 
retail segment analysis revenues for our retail operations were down from last year as our retail group experienced a very difficult year 
we believe the reasons behind the decline are a combination of a weak economy in the first quarter of  increased competition primarily from funeral homes selling memorials  and pricing policies for our retail memorials that caused us to lose sales from the lower end segment of the market 
while we have little control over the economy  we are taking measures to partner with certain funeral homes and cemeteries in selected markets where appropriate and modifying and expanding our product offerings in order to better capture sales to those customers who desire a memorial priced at the lower end of the market 
gross profit dollars for the retail operations decreased from last year as a result of decreased revenue  however gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to over last year 
we remain pleased with gross margins in the to range  but expect this may drop slightly as a result of modifying our product offerings to capture a larger share of the segment of the market buying lower end memorials 
we believe increasing the availability of lower end memorials will add revenue and will not be a substitute for rock of ages personalized branded memorials and will therefore increase overall gross profit  even if gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreases somewhat 
sg a costs in retail increased just but increased as a percentage of revenue primarily as a result of declining revenues and a certain portion of our sg a costs being fixed in the short term 
we expect sg a costs will decrease as a result of some cost cutting measures implemented late in and expect sg a costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease as a result of the combination of reduced costs and an expected increase in revenue in as a result of the sale of our cemetery division in december  our cemetery operations are not shown as a separate segment but as discontinued operations in accordance with gaap for all years presented 
further details concerning this are explained below 
consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead decreased from last year primarily as a result of a one time severance payment of  in as a result of classifying the cemeteries as discontinued operations  a portion of interest expense associated with the debt that was repaid using the proceeds from the sale of our cemetery business was reclassified into discontinued operations in all years presented 
interest expense decreased slightly from the combined effect of slightly lower borrowings and decreased interest rates in compared to income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income increased to for from in primarily as a result of a greater portion of our consolidated pre tax income coming from our canadian operations  which are taxed at a higher rate 
in  we expect our tax rate will return to historical levels in the to range provided our pre tax profits in the us also return to historical levels 
income from discontinued operations  net of taxes was  in broken down as follows we had a gain on the sale of the cemetery operations of  this gain was offset by the loss from operations of the cemeteries in of  an impairment charge of  for the discontinued autumn rose quarry  and the loss from the operations of the autumn rose quarry of  in  income from discontinued operations net of taxes was  consisting primarily of the profit from cemetery operations 
the autumn rose quarry has been an immaterial contributor to our quarry operations over the last several years and we determined it would be best to sell the quarry so we can focus on other operations 
the fair value of the quarry  and the associated impairment charge  is management s best estimate based on discussions with prospective buyers of the quarry 
while we believe our estimate of fair value is reasonable  we may need to take additional impairment charges if we are unable to negotiate a sale that is consistent with our estimate of the quarry s value 
see additional discussion in critical accounting policies  impairment of long lived assets 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue was down  gross profit declined and total sg a costs decreased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues for the quarry division increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in strong demand for our bethel white  gardenia white and salisbury pink quarries  as well as increased revenues from our pennsylvania black quarry due to good yields  were the major factors for the revenue increase 
quarrying gross profit dollars increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in during  we elected to change the method of valuing inventory in the quarry division from the first in  first out method to a specific annual average cost method 
the effect of the change in was to decrease operating income by  we believe the specific annual average cost method more accurately matches costs with revenue  resulting in an enhanced measurement of operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in gross profit dollars was attributable to an increase in revenue and an increase in yields at the bethel white  pennsylvania black  and gardenia white quarries 
the slight decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue was a result of decreased quarry yields and higher repair and maintenance costs in the barre gray quarry  which was almost entirely offset by an increase in gross margin percentage at the pennsylvania black and gardenia white quarries 
quarry sg a costs increased for the year ended december  largely as a result of increased legal expenses for the eurimex litigation compared to the same period in manufacturing segment analysis manufacturing revenues decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily a result of the sale of the childs childs manufacturing facility in elberton  georgia childs in and a decrease in sales in industrial products as a result of decreased demand for those products due to a general economic slowdown 
these decreases were partially offset by revenue recognized on the national world war ii memorial 
manufacturing gross profit dollars increased and gross margin as a percentage of manufacturing revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in gross margin percentage was a result of improved operations in our barre manufacturing facility as well as a more favorable product mix  including more branded memorials in this facility compared to the same period in the sale of the lawson facility  which was completed in january  also had a positive effect on gross margins due to the elimination of traditionally low margin customers and a strong focus on our core authorized dealer network resulting in increased branded sales  which have historically had higher gross margins than unbranded sales 
in connection with the lawson sale  we entered into a seven year contract to purchase memorials from the new owner 
although there are many alternative suppliers of granite memorials  we are dependent on this arrangement to provide product to our customers and believe it will continue to be a favorable arrangement 
manufacturing sg a costs decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily the result of the sale of the lawson manufacturing facility as well as the elimination of the sg a costs associated with the childs plant in elberton  ga 
retail segment analysis retailing revenues were lower in compared to during the preceding year period  order receipts averaged approximately million per year 
in  we decreased our backlog of orders by approximately million resulting in revenues in excess of the average annual order receipts 
the decrease in revenue in was a result of insufficient order receipts from our retail outlets that would have been required to maintain the prior year s level due in part to the closure of certain unprofitable stores in the latter part of and in retailing gross profit dollars for the year ended december  declined and gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to compared to the year ended december  the decrease in dollars and percentage was attributable to the lower revenues in and an associated decrease in operational efficiencies 
sg a costs in the retail segment decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily as a result of lower commission payments to sales persons as a result of lower revenues 
consolidated items interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower interest rates under our credit facilities as well as a reduction in debt funded by cash from operations and from the proceeds of the sale of southern mausoleums  inc smi  childs  the royalty quarries royalty and lawson 
income taxes as a percentage of earnings before taxes decreased to in from in the high rate in was the result of the disposition of the quarrying and manufacturing assets for which the write down of goodwill was non deductible for tax purposes 
the tax rate is consistent with the company s historical rate 
income loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  of  net of taxes  was primarily from cemetery operations which were reclassified as discontinued operations in  compared to a loss of  net of taxes for a significant portion of the increase in was the result of the completion of a large project that had been presold 
the cumulative effect in prior years of changes in accounting principles for the year ended december  was a loss of million compared to for the loss consisted primarily of a write down of million in goodwill net of deferred tax benefit of million as a result of adopting sfas as well as a change in accounting method for quarry inventory  which resulted in a  write down of inventory net of tax benefit of 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we consider our liquidity to be adequate to meet our long and short term cash requirements to fund operations and pursue our growth strategy 
historically  we have met these requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
we anticipate there may be future acquisitions  as we pursue our growth strategy that may require additional financing compared to our existing credit facility 
in january  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total of  as part of our share buy back program 
upon completion of this transaction  we have repurchased a total of  shares for  under the share buy back program 
there remains  shares authorized to be purchased under the current repurchase program 
we will continue to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis determined by  among other things  current debt levels  anticipated uses of capital  the price of the stock and the general market conditions 
in  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan improved by approximately million primarily as a result of payments to fund the plan of million in we also made payments of million in we have historically contributed between  and million per year and expect to make annual contributions in this range  which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
as a result of the accumulated benefit obligations of our defined benefit plan exceeding the fair market value of the plan s assets  we recorded a million minimum liability during  through a charge to equity of million  net of taxes of  this charge is reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million  compared to approximately million and million  respectively  at december  cash from operations 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in the primary reason for the change is the lower earnings in  excluding the effects of the write down of goodwill in coupled with the non cash adjustments primarily associated with the sale of the cemeteries  and other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in the primary differences were decreases in working capital in resulting from the sale of smi  childs  the royalty quarries royalty and lawson  as well as an increase in accrued expenses associated with the purchase of the cemeteries  both of which had the effect of increasing cash from operations in see note to consolidated financial statements 
cash from investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in  we had higher than normal levels of capital expenditures  especially in our retail segment  as we made improvements to store facilities and constructed new facilities in order to support and enhance the brand image of our company 
these expenditures were slightly offset by the million in cash received  as of december   toward the total million due from saber management llc from the sale of the cemeteries 
in  our capital expenditures were at a lower level and were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the lawson facility 
cash used in investing activities comes from either borrowings under our credit facilities or from operations 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in the higher uses in were primarily the result of the purchase of the cemetery operations 
cash from financing activities 
financing activities used million in cash in primarily as a result of the repurchase of  shares of the company s common stock  compared to million used in primarily as a result of principal payments on long term debt 
in  million in cash was used in financing activities for repayments of the lines of credit and the long term debt 
capital resources cit credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit cit that expires in october the facility consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
as of december   we had million outstanding and million available under the term loan line of credit and million outstanding and million available under the revolving credit facility 
on january   we received payment under a promissory note from saber in connection with the sale of the cemetery operations  which closed on december  following the payment of that note on january   we had outstanding on the revolving credit facility and million outstanding on the term loan line of credit 
our loan agreement with cit places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  repurchase stock  and make investments or guarantees 
the agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company as described below 
debt service coverage ratio 
the facility requires the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less taxes and capital expenditures to the sum of interest and scheduled debt repayments be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter 
as of december   this ratio was a negative as a result of significant legal expenses in the eurimex litigation and decreased earnings in our retail operations which lowered ebitda  as well as much higher than normal capital expenditures in we have received a waiver of this covenant until september  when we believe we will be in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio 
the waiver requires we meet a minimum interim ebitda target for the three month period ended december  of million  for the six month period ending march  of negative million  and for the nine month period ending june  of million 
as of december   we were in compliance with the amended covenants as our ebitda for the three month period ended december  was million  which exceeded by million our minimum requirement of million as outlined in the table below 
finally  the waiver requires our capital expenditures for the twelve month period ending december  not exceed million  which historically is a typical level of our annual capital expenditures 
ebitda consists of in thousands three months ended december  net income interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda total liabilities to net worth ratio 
the facility also requires the ratio of the company s total liabilities to net worth not exceed as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant as our total liabilities to net worth ratio was 
interest rates 
we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with cit 
as a result of the covenant violation described above in the debt service coverage ratio paragraph  we paid an additional on both the revolving credit facility and the term loan for the three month period ended december  those rates were for the revolving credit facility for the libor election and for the prime rate election  and for the term loan as of december  the rates in effect as of december  which include the additional mentioned above were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility million prime revolving credit facility million libor term loans million libor we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
as a result of the waiver noted above  the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio and the company is currently at the most favorable increments available since we substantially exceeded the interim ebitda minimum for the quarter ended december  the following table shows the libor or prime rate elections libor election prime election revolving credit facility libor prime term loans libor prime canadian credit facility as of december   we also had million cdn available and outstanding under a demand revolving line of credit with the royal bank of canada

the agreement was entered into on january  and the remaining term is five years 
capital expenditures our primary need for capital will be to maintain and improve our manufacturing  quarrying  and retail facilities and to finance acquisitions as part of our growth strategy

seasonality historically  our operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally our net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern areas generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
in addition  we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to adverse weather conditions 
as a result  we have historically incurred a net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
risk factors that may affect future results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our continued growth depends  at least in part  on our ability to form relationships with funeral directors  cemeteries and other death care providers 
our ability to continue to grow our retail business depends in part on our ability to develop referral relationships with funeral homes  cemeteries and other death care professionals 
we cannot assure you we will be able to successfully form these relationships in all of the areas in which we have retail businesses 
in certain areas  we may be unable to form such relationships where our stores are in direct competition with funeral homes and cemeteries that sell granite memorials 
our continued growth depends  at least in part  on acquisitions  which involve numerous risks that could negatively affect our earnings and financial condition 
our ability to continue to grow depends in part upon the acquisition of additional companies 
we cannot assure you we will identify suitable acquisition candidates  or we will be able to consummate transactions on acceptable terms 
further  even if we successfully acquire additional companies  we cannot assure you we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of such companies with our own 
we intend to finance acquisitions through a combination of available cash resources  bank borrowings  and  in appropriate circumstances  the issuance of equity and or debt securities 
acquiring additional companies will have a significant effect on our financial position  and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results 
also  acquisitions may result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on the company s financial statements  the write off of which would reduce reported earnings at the point in time the goodwill is deemed impaired 
with respect to retail acquisitions  and as a result of our definition of reporting units under sfas  goodwill impairment could be incurred at the closing of the acquisition 
litigation or similar proceedings could result in substantial expense and distraction and seriously harm our business 
as described in item of this report  we are involved in an arbitration proceeding with eurimex involving claims made by eurimex related to our termination of the distribution agreement for our salisbury pink granite and to the distribution agreement for our bethel white granite  which expired by its terms in in connection with this matter  eurimex has claimed damages of million  plus interest  moral damages  attorney s fees and costs 
we have reserved amounts which we believe to be adequate for anticipated legal fees for the review of the decision in this matter when received and the pursuit of counterclaims  but this reserve does not contain any provision of any kind for an adverse judgment or an appeal thereof because it is our opinion that we will prevail in this action 
if the arbitral panel were to decide in favor of eurimex  and award substantial damages  we will not have any reserve to cover these damages and our business would most likely be seriously harmed 
we may in the future be the target of other litigations or claims  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
opening new stores is a component of our growth strategy and entails uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect our profitability 
our ability to continue to grow our retail business will depend in part upon our ability to open new retail stores in selected locations 
our success in opening new retail stores will depend on our ability to identify suitable locations for opening new retail stores on acceptable terms  our ability to attract and retain competent management and sales personnel  and our ability to form strategic alliances and relationships with local funeral homes  cemeteries and other death care professionals  and our ability to attract customers to our new stores 
it is unlikely new retail stores we open will generate significant profits in the early stages  and many new stores will lose money for the first few years of operation 
accordingly  opening new retail stores may adversely affect our business or profitability 
if we are unable to maintain our relationships with independent retailers  our sales may not continue to grow and could decline 
we have historically sold our granite memorials to consumers through independent retailers 
over the past five years  we have acquired retailers with multiple retail outlets in states 
however  we are still dependent in part on our independent retailers for the successful distribution of our products to the ultimate customer 
we have no control over the independent retailers operations  including such matters as retail price  advertising and marketing 
three important components of our growth strategy are to continue to acquire retailers  open new retail stores in selected markets and pursue strategic alliances with funeral homes  cemetery owners  and other death care professionals 
although we have taken steps to reduce conflicts between our owned retail stores and our independent retailers  the implementation of these elements of our strategy has in the past been  and may in the future be  construed by some of our existing independent retailers as an effort to compete with them 
in certain cases  this has adversely affected their relationship with us and caused them to decrease or cease their purchases of our products 
these issues may continue to arise as we pursue our growth strategy 
in addition  significant barriers to entry created by local heritage  community presence and tradition characterize the granite memorial retail industry 
consequently  we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulty replacing retailers or entering particular retail markets in the event of a loss of an independent retailer 
we cannot assure you we will be able to maintain our existing relationships or establish new relationships with independent retailers 
disruption in our relationships with independent retailers could impede our sales growth or cause sales to decline  which would adversely affect our business and financial results 
if we lose our key personnel  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  our business could suffer 
our operations and the implementation of our operating and growth strategies  such as integration of acquisitions and the opening of new retail stores  are management intensive 
we are substantially dependent upon the abilities and continued efforts of kurt m 
swenson  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and other senior management 
our business is also dependent on our ability to continue to attract and retain a highly skilled retail  quarrying and manufacturing workforce  including sales managers and counselors  stone cutters  sand blasters  sculptors and other skilled artisans 
the loss of the services of mr 
swenson  other members of the company s senior management or other highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we face intense competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully  we may be unable to increase our sales  which would adversely affect our business and profitability 
the dimension stone industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other dimension stone quarriers  including quarriers of granite  marble  limestone  travertine and other natural stones 
we also compete with manufacturers of so called engineered stone as well as manufacturers of other building materials like concrete  aluminum  glass  wood and other materials 
we compete with providers of these materials on the basis of price  availability of supply  end user preference for certain colors  patterns or textures  and other factors 
the granite memorial industry is also highly competitive 
we compete with other granite quarriers and manufacturers in the sale of granite blocks for memorial use on the basis of price  color  quality  geographic proximity  service  design availability  production capability  availability of supply and delivery options 
all of our colors of granite are subject to competition from memorial grade granite blocks of similar color supplied by quarriers located throughout the world 
there are approximately manufacturers of granite memorials in north america 
there are also manufacturers of granite memorials in india  south africa  china and portugal that sell finished memorials in north america 
our quarrying and manufacturing competitors include both domestic and international companies  some of which may have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and other resources 
foreign competitors may have access to lower cost labor and better commercial deposits of memorial grade granite  and may be subject to less restrictive regulatory requirements 
for example  companies in south africa  india  china and portugal also manufacture and export finished granite memorials into north america which compete with our products 
the competition for retail sales of granite memorials faced by our retail outlets is also intense and is based on price  quality  service  design availability and breadth of product line 
competitors include funeral home and cemetery owners  including consolidators  which have greater financial resources than we do  as well as approximately  independent retailers of granite memorials located outside of cemeteries and funeral homes 
we cannot assure you domestic or foreign competition will not adversely impact our business 
the increasing trend toward cremation  and potential declines in memorialization for other reasons  may result in decreased sales of our products 
there is an increasing trend toward cremation in the united states 
according to the cremation association of north america  or cana  cremation was used in approximately of the deaths in the united states in  compared to approximately in  and cana expects this rate to rise to approximately by while we continue to believe that many families will choose to permanently memorialize their loved ones  regardless of whether they choose cremation over a traditional burial  to the extent increases in cremation rates result in decreases in memorialization rates  this decrease will result in a decline in our memorial sales  which will adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our business is also subject to the risk memorialization rates may decline over time for other reasons 
certain cemeteries have in the past and may in the future limit the use of granite memorials as a memorialization option 
to the extent general memorialization rates or the willingness of cemeteries to accept granite memorials declines  this decline could adversely affect our business 
sales of our products are seasonal and may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 
historically  our operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales are highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather 
cemeteries in northern regions generally do not accept granite memorials during winter months when the ground is frozen because they cannot be properly set 
we typically close certain of our vermont and canadian quarries during these months because of increased operating costs attributable to weather conditions 
we have historically incurred an aggregate net loss during the first three months of each calendar year 
our operating results may vary materially from quarter to quarter due to  among other things  acquisitions  changes in product mix and limitations on the timing of price increases  making quarterly year to year comparisons less meaningful 
our competitive position could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe our tradenames  trademarks  brands  designs and other intellectual property are of great value  and we rely on trademark  copyright and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to this valuable intellectual property 
third parties may in the future try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights 
we may need to resort to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights  most notably the rock of ages trademark  could have a material adverse effect on our business and competitive position 
our business is subject to a number of operating risks that are difficult to predict and manage 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to numerous risks and hazards inherent in those industries  including among others  unanticipated surface or underground conditions  varying saleable granite recovery rates due to natural cracks and other imperfections in granite quarries  equipment failures  accidents and worker injuries  labor issues  weather conditions and events  unanticipated transportation costs and price fluctuations 
as a result  actual costs and expenditures  production quantities and delivery dates  as well as revenues  may differ materially from those anticipated  which could adversely affect our operating results 
our international operations may expose us to a number of risks related to conducting business in foreign countries 
we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal from sales to customers outside the united states  with approximately of revenues in fiscal from sales in canada by the company s canadian subsidiary 
foreign sales are subject to numerous risks  including currency conversion risks  limitations including taxes on the reparation of earnings  slower and more difficult accounts receivable collection and greater complication and expense in complying with foreign laws 
sales of our ancillary products are cyclical  which may adversely affect our operating results 
the markets for our industrial precision products  which include machine base and surface plates that are utilized in the automotive  aeronautic  computer  machine tool  optical  precision grinding and inspection industries  and granite press rolls used in the manufacture of paper  are subject to substantial cyclical variations 
sales of these products are subject to decline as a result of general economic downturns  or as a result of uncertainties regarding current and future economic conditions that generally affect such industries 
we cannot assure you changes in the industries to which we sell our precision products will not adversely affect our operating results 
existing stockholders are able to exercise significant control over us 
kurt m 
swenson and his brother  kevin c 
swenson  collectively have of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our common stock  and will therefore be in a position to control the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of transactions involving a change in control of the company 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with government regulations 
our quarry and manufacturing operations are subject to substantial regulation by federal and state governmental statutes and agencies  including the federal occupational safety and health act  the mine safety and health administration and similar state and canadian authorities 
our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations administered by the united states environmental protection agency and similar state and canadian authorities  for the protection of the environment  including but not limited to those relating to air and water quality  and solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal 
these laws and regulations may require parties to fund remedial action or to pay damages regardless of fault 
environmental laws and regulations may also impose liability with respect to divested or terminated operations even if the operations were divested or terminated many years ago 
in addition  current and future environmental or occupational health and safety laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations may require significant expenditures for compliance  which could require us to modify or curtail our operations 
we cannot predict the effect of such laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
while we expect to be able to continue to comply with existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations  any material non compliance could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
no call legislation may adversely affect our retail marketing efforts 
our retail stores and sales counselors are subject to the so called no call laws  which allow consumers to place their telephone number on a no call list maintained by various states and the federal government 
at present  there are no call laws in a majority of states in which we do business and the federal no call law went into effect in the fall of counselors are unable to make telephone calls to any consumer whose number has been placed on the applicable no call list  subject to certain limited exceptions 
making telephone calls to introduce the company and set appointments has been an important part of marketing our retail products and services 
while we are taking steps to decrease our reliance on telephone marketing calls  compliance with the no call laws could adversely affect our retail business and results of operations 
provisions of our corporate organizational documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if it would be beneficial to our stockholders 
certain provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and by laws grant ten votes per share to each share of class b common stock  divide the board of directors into three classes  each of which will have a different three year term  provide the stockholders may remove directors from office only for cause and by a supermajority vote  provide special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or certain company officers and not by stockholders  establish certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for stockholder proposals to be considered at annual stockholders meetings  authorize the issuance of preferred stock 
accordingly  the board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could materially adversely affect the voting power or other rights of  or be dilutive to  the holders of our common stock 
certain of these provisions may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control or unsolicited acquisition proposals a stockholder may consider favorable 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit or delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk rock of ages has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally debt obligations under its credit facilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
based on our current variable rate debt obligations  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily from the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
based on the size of this subsidiary and our corresponding exposure to changes in the canadian us dollar exchange rate  we do not consider our market exposure relating to currency exchange to be material
