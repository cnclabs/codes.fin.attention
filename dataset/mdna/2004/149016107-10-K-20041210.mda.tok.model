item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our revenues are derived from product sales  which include both licenses of the dct and mgts system software and sales of dct and mgts hardware  and from services  which include customer support under hardware and software support contracts as well as installation and training 
prices for the dct and mgts systems vary widely depending upon overall system configuration  including the number and type of software protocol modules and the number of physical interfaces required by the customer 
a dct or mgts system sale typically ranges in price from approximately  to over  in addition to the initial system purchase  customers also may upgrade their systems by purchasing additional software protocol modules and hardware 
customers have the option to purchase a third party workstation or pc from us or provide a workstation or pc to us for configuration 
product sales are recognized upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete  provided collection is probable 
we offer product warranties for various lengths of time  depending on the product and the country of purchase or operation 
customers may elect to purchase a software support contract which includes both ongoing technical support and any new software releases on a when and if available basis during the term of the contract 
these software releases may include updates for protocols already licensed by the customer 
revenues from software support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is generally one year 
new customers often purchase onsite training  which is charged on a fixed price basis and recognized when complete 
conditions and trends in our industry after several years of relatively rapid growth  the global telecommunications industry experienced a severe and well publicized contraction beginning in by  our customers began cutting their research and development budgets that fund the majority of our revenues 
as a result  beginning in the second quarter of calendar  we faced challenging conditions in our telecommunications test business 
over the course of our last fiscal year ended september   there has been increasing evidence  also well publicized  that the overall decline in the telecommunications industry has ended  and that at least the beginnings of a recovery are in evidence 
this improvement in market conditions has resulted in increased purchasing of our products and services by our customers overseas  where third generation wireless deployment has begun 
in north america  where third generation wireless deployment has yet to begin except in a few markets  our revenues were unchanged from the previous year 
summary of our financial performance in fiscal our financial performance in the year ended september  improved significantly over our performance in the previous year our revenues increased by to million and our net income increased by to million 
three major factors contributed to this improved financial performance in europe and japan  we saw strong revenue increases of and  respectively due to the improvement in overseas market conditions discussed above and to a increase in the value of the japanese yen  in which all our revenues in japan are denominated 
we saw an improvement of four percentage points in overall gross profit margin due principally to two factors our product mix was weighted more heavily to higher margin product  and  despite a increase in our product revenues  our manufacturing overhead costs decreased by or million in the absence of the transitional acquisition related manufacturing costs we incurred in fiscal we limited the increase in our operating expenses to  well below the increase in total revenues 
increased variable compensation related to above target performance together with the increased cost of overseas employees resulting from higher exchange rates were largely offset by the effects of a 
table of contents staff reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal and a further staff reduction in fiscal during fiscal  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million  of which million was provided by operating activities  million was provided from the sale of stock under our stock option and employee share purchase plans and million was provided from the sale of  shares in an underwritten public offering 
the offering also included  shares which tekelec received upon conversion of million in notes  and  shares sold by two of our directors of which  shares represented an over allotment exercised by the underwriters shortly after year end  and  shares were sold in a subsequent closing 
as a result of the note conversion  we ended the fiscal year debt free 
capital expenditures in fiscal amounted to million  well below our million in depreciation 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies below and the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying these policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below and throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected future financial results 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
for a discussion on the application of these other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of our product arrangements normally include hardware and software 
certain of our sales may also include installation 
we also offer training and maintenance services separately from our product arrangements 
we recognize revenue on system sales upon shipment or  if installation services are purchased  when installation is complete  provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
in connection with each transaction involving these arrangements  we examine the customer agreement and or purchase order to determine that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we judge that the fee is fixed or determinable by verifying that it corresponds to the fee charged for comparable arrangements and that the payment terms do not extend significantly beyond our customary range  and we judge that collection is probable based on customer credit information and payment history 
training and maintenance revenues are based on our established history of charging separate fees for training and maintenance 
revenues allocated to training are recognized at the time the training is complete 
revenues allocated to maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract during which the services are provided 
the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments in any of these areas involving revenue recognition 
foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
gains or losses on forward contracts and options as well as the cost of the options are included in other income 
table of contents expense  net 
to the extent that our judgment in mitigating the risk of movements in foreign exchange rates is imperfect  we may incur foreign exchange losses that could affect our results of operations 
use of estimates  allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our use of estimates and assumptions includes  but is not limited to  our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when judging the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the amount and timing of revenue recognized in any period may differ materially if we make different judgments 
our accounts receivable balance as of september  was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish or increase a valuation allowance in a period  the change is included as an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
based on our estimates concerning future results of operation  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for net operating losses or for foreign tax credits 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
net operating losses totaled million and  at september  and  respectively 
foreign tax credits amounted to million and million at september  and  respectively 
in addition  the estimation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in all the jurisdictions in which we do business 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of the possibility that additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of additional amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the associated liabilities and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which this determination is made 
if we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be  we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which this determination is made 
goodwill and long lived assets effective october   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and an annual impairment test 
we performed our most recent annual impairment test on september  and determined that we have a single reporting unit 
we did not record a loss on impairment of goodwill during the fiscal years ended september   and we will continue to perform this test annually using the methodology described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
goodwill was million at september  and 
table of contents sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate a review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of and that we have committed to a plan to dispose of  whether through sale or abandonment  are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
during the years ended september  and  we did not record any impairment charges on long lived assets or certain intangible assets 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on long lived assets and certain intangible assets to reduce the carrying amount of these assets 
net intangible assets and long lived assets were million and million at september  and  respectively 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to overseas market recovery that resulted in increased shipments of our test products and to a increase in the value of the japanese yen  in which all our revenues in japan are denominated 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance 
by geographic region  north american revenues in fiscal remained unchanged from fiscal at million  european revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  japanese revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and rest of world revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of revenues cost of product revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal both the decrease in cost of product revenues and the increase in gross margin on product revenues reflected primarily two factors first  our product mix was weighted more heavily to higher margin product  and secondly  our manufacturing overhead costs decreased by or million in the absence of the transitional acquisition related manufacturing costs we incurred in fiscal cost of services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due primarily to a million increase in variable compensation related to above target performance and to a provision of million for the replacement of certain product under maintenance contract 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew slightly more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology in fiscal remained unchanged from the million expensed in fiscal cost of revenues expressed as a percentage of revenues did not vary significantly by geographic region 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease reflected primarily four factors a decrease of approximately million due to a reduction of  or employees  in the number of research and development personnel largely as a result of the staff reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increases totaling million in variable compensation related to above target performance  increases of million in new product development and testing costs  and an exchange rate driven increase of million due to average increases of in the australian dollar and in the british pound against the us dollar 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal we expect the absolute annual level of research and development expenses to increase by approximately in fiscal primarily as a result of an anticipated increase in the number of employees in this area 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily as a result of three factors a million increase in variable compensation related to above target performance  a decrease of approximately million due to a reduction of  or employees  in the number of sales and marketing personnel largely as a result of the staff reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an exchange rate driven increase of million due to average increases of in the japanese yen  in the british pound and in the euro against the us dollar 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased from of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal we expect the absolute annual level of sales and marketing expenses to increase by approximately in fiscal primarily as a result of an anticipated increase in the number of employees in this area 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a million increase in variable compensation related to above target performance  a million decrease in facilities costs in the absence of transitional costs related to the ndb acquisition and a million increase in legal and accounting costs due to increased regulatory compliance costs 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from to over the same period 
we expect the absolute annual level of general and administrative expenses to increase by up to in fiscal due to increased regulatory compliance costs 
restructuring costs no restructuring charge was recorded in fiscal a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to costs associated with the involuntary termination of employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in the customer service component of services cost of goods and in the manufacturing component of product cost of goods 
the terminations represented of our pre termination workforce 
interest income interest income remained unchanged at million in fiscal in comparison with fiscal as the effect of higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances was offset by lower prevailing rates of return 
realized gains and losses on sale of securities are included in interest income 
interest expense interest expense on the convertible notes payable decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a decrease in interest accrued on the convertible notes payable resulting from these notes being outstanding for a shorter period of time in fiscal than in fiscal 
table of contents other income other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due principally to a reduction of million in foreign exchange gains and the absence in fiscal of a japanese consumption tax refund in the amount of approximately million received in fiscal income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal primarily due to a reduction of approximately million in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year 
this reduction was made as a result of a determination that additional taxes for which we had previously recognized liabilities would not be due 
in fiscal  we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million as a result of three factors the identification of approximately million in additional taxes recoverable from a previous period  a reduction of approximately million in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year as a result of the likely favorable outcome of a tax audit of our japanese subsidiary  and the recognition of approximately million in future tax benefits of foreign tax credits created in the liquidation of the japanese subsidiary acquired from tekelec 
as a result  our effective tax rate changed from a benefit of in fiscal to a benefit of in fiscal we do not expect to record a tax benefit in fiscal potential additional expense for stock based compensation on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb concluded that proposed statement r  share based payment  which would require all companies to measure compensation expense for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  will be effective  if it is adopted by the fasb  for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  adoption of fasb statement r would require us to record an expense for stock based compensation plans and would result in ongoing accounting charges that would significantly reduce our net income 
see the section entitled stock based compensation in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal years ended september  and revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses for the year ended september  include a full months of the results of the continuing operations of ndb 
the corresponding figures for the year ended september  include one month of the results of the continuing operations of ndb from august   the date it was acquired by us  and exclude the results of the discontinued distribution and consulting businesses engaged in by tekelec limited in japan as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues total revenues increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal despite the additional mgts revenues resulting from the ndb acquisition  product revenues increased by only approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to prevailing market weakness that negatively affected shipments of both dct and mgts products 
services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to the increase in the number of systems under maintenance  primarily as a result of the ndb acquisition 
by geographic region  north american revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million fiscal primarily due to additional revenues from the ndb acquisition 
european revenues decreased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal japanese revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal rest of world revenues of million were reported for the first time in fiscal 
table of contents cost of revenues cost of product revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margin on product revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal both the increase in cost of product revenues and the decrease in gross margin on product revenues reflected two factors first  the higher cost of goods on the more hardware intensive mgts product in comparison with the dct product  and second  the additional manufacturing costs incurred on mgts product during the six month period ended february  when this product was manufactured for us by tekelec under a transitional services agreement 
cost of services revenues increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a corresponding increase in the costs of customer support personnel due to the ndb acquisition 
gross margin on services revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal as the cost of providing services revenues  consisting primarily of compensation costs  grew more than the associated revenues 
gross margin on services revenues may also vary depending on the timing of system sales and support contract renewals 
amortization of purchased technology increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal reflecting a full months of amortization in the latter year in comparison with a single month in the former 
research and development research and development expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to a corresponding increase in compensation and other costs associated with ndb research and development activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of two factors an increase of approximately million in compensation and other associated costs due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in sales and marketing activities as a result of the ndb acquisition  and an increase of approximately  in the cost of sales and marketing activities outside the united states due to an increase in the values of the foreign currencies in which this cost is incurred 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from of revenues in fiscal to in fiscal general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by approximately from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was due to four factors an increase of  in facilities costs due primarily to the ndb acquisition  an increase of  in compensation costs due to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the performance of general and administrative activities  an increase of  in premiums for general liability  directors and officers and workers compensation insurance  and an increase of  in non cash amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from to over the same period 
restructuring costs a restructuring charge of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to costs associated with the involuntary termination of employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in the customer service component of services cost of goods and in the manufacturing component of product cost of goods 
the terminations represented of our pre termination workforce 
no restructuring charge was recorded in fiscal 
table of contents purchased in process research and development in fiscal  million in purchased in process research and development was charged to operating expenses 
this amount represented two ndb research and development projects in process as of august   the date of the acquisition of ndb 
the value of these projects was determined by an independent appraiser using established valuation techniques and was expensed because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed as of the date of acquisition 
there was no expense recorded in fiscal for purchased in process research and development 
interest income interest income decreased from million in fiscal to  in fiscal due to lower cash and short term investment balances resulting from the million paid on closing of the ndb acquisition and to lower prevailing rates of return  partially offset by amortization of  of the convertible notes valuation premium in fiscal in comparison with  in fiscal realized gains and losses on sale of securities are included in interest income 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to an increase in interest accrued on the convertible notes payable resulting from these notes being outstanding for a longer period of time in fiscal than in fiscal other income expense  net other income improved from an expense of  in fiscal to income of million in fiscal due to two factors foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal in contrast with the foreign exchange losses in fiscal and the receipt in fiscal of a japanese consumption tax refund in the amount of approximately  income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal as a result of three factors the identification of approximately  in additional taxes recoverable from a previous period  a reduction of approximately  in the estimated tax payable at the end of the fiscal year as a result of the likely favorable outcome of a tax audit of our japanese subsidiary  and the recognition of approximately  in future tax benefits of foreign tax credits created in the liquidation of the japanese subsidiary acquired from tekelec 
as a result  our effective tax rate changed from a provision of in fiscal to a benefit of in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations  from the proceeds of our initial public offering completed in early and from the proceeds of a second public offering completed in september the proceeds to us from the and offerings  net of underwriter fees and other expenses  were approximately million and million  respectively 
our purchase of ndb was additionally financed through the issuance of two convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible notes were issued by our irish subsidiary and were guaranteed by us 
these notes were converted by tekelec into  shares of our common stock in september our operating activities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in each of these years  net income was the primary component of cash flows from operating activities  providing million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash generated by net income was increased by adjustments for non cash charges totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the level of these 
table of contents non cash charges increased in comparison with historical rates beginning in fiscal due to charges for additional depreciation  amortization and purchased in process research and development related to our acquisition of ndb 
the purchased in process research and development charge was incurred in fiscal  the additional non cash depreciation charges will end in fiscal and the majority of the non cash amortization charges will end in fiscal finally  our cash flows from operations are affected by changes in current assets and liabilities  net of the effects of the acquisition 
these changes in non cash working capital components increased cash flow from operations by million in fiscal  decreased cash flow from operations by million in fiscal and decreased cash flow from operations by million in fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
we calculate our days outstanding by dividing our accounts receivable balance net of allowances at the end of a period by the revenues for that period and multiplying the result by the number of days in the period 
our days outstanding improved from days for the year ended september  to days for the year ended september  because the accounts receivable component of the days outstanding calculation as of september  included accounts receivable acquired with ndb but the revenue component of the calculation did not include the associated pre acquisition revenues 
our days outstanding further improved to days for the year ended september  due primarily to the increased intra quarter invoicing linearity that resulted from an improvement in business conditions over the year then ended 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms extended to our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
investing activities have consisted of three components the acquisition of ndb  purchases of property and equipment and purchases and sales of short term investments 
our acquisition of ndb used cash of million in fiscal and million in fiscal purchases of property and equipment increased from a pre acquisition million in fiscal to million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect that capital expenditures will total approximately million in fiscal we invest cash that is surplus to our operating requirements in our short term investment portfolio 
purchases and sales of short term investments used cash of million in fiscal as surplus cash was invested  provided cash of million in fiscal as cash was withdrawn to assist with the final acquisition payment and used cash of million in fiscal as surplus cash that we generated was invested 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal as we repurchased a higher value of common stock than the value that we issued 
financing activities provided cash of million in fiscal from the sale of shares in a public offering  the exercise of stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of september   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
as of september   we had the following contractual obligations  in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases total contractual cash obligations we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our business 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funds generated from operations will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents factors that may affect future results the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly  and this may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced  and anticipate that we will continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
our revenues and operating results are relatively difficult to forecast for a number of reasons  including the variable size and timing of individual purchases by our customers  seasonal factors that may affect capital spending by customers  such as the varying fiscal year ends of customers and the reduction in business during the summer months  particularly in europe  the relatively long sales cycles for our products  competitive conditions in our markets  exchange rate fluctuations  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us and by our customers  competitors and suppliers  costs associated with developing and introducing new products  product life cycles  changes in the level of operating expenses relative to revenues  product defects and other quality problems  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  supply interruptions  changes in global or regional economic conditions or in the telecommunications industry  delays in purchasing decisions or customer orders due to customer consolidation  the ability to hire sales and technical personnel  changes in the mix of products sold  and changes in the regulatory environment 
our revenues in any period generally have been  and may continue to be  derived from relatively small numbers of sales and service transactions with relatively high average revenues per order 
therefore  the loss of any orders or delays in closing such transactions could have a more significant impact on our quarterly revenues and results of operations than on those of companies with relatively high volumes of sales or low revenues per order 
our products generally are shipped within to days after orders are received 
as a result  we generally do not have a significant backlog of orders  and revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked  shipped and installed in that quarter 
most of our costs  including personnel and facilities costs  are relatively fixed  and our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue 
as a result  a decline in revenue from even a limited number of transactions  failure to achieve expected revenue in any quarter or unanticipated variations in the timing of recognition of specific revenues can cause significant variations in our quarterly operating results and could result in losses 
we believe  therefore  that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 

table of contents due to the factors described above  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is possible that in some future quarter our results of operations could fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may fall 
historically  our revenues have been dependent upon a few significant customers  the loss of one or more of which could significantly reduce our revenues 
our customer base is highly concentrated  and a relatively small number of companies have accounted for substantially all of our revenues to date 
in our fiscal year ended september   our top five customers represented approximately of total revenues 
we expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively limited number of customers for substantially all of our revenues in future periods  although no customer is presently obligated either to purchase a specific amount of products or to provide us with binding forecasts of purchases for any period 
if we were to lose a significant customer or if a significant customer were to reduce  delay or cancel its orders  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
our business is dependent on our customers outsourcing their telecommunications testing needs  and our business could be harmed if the market for outsourced testing solutions declines or fails to grow 
our success will depend on continued growth in the market for telecommunications test systems and services and the continued commercial acceptance of our products as a solution to address the testing requirements of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
while most of our present and potential customers have the technical capability and financial resources to produce their own test systems and perform test services internally  to date  many have chosen to outsource a substantial proportion of their test system and service requirements 
our customers may not continue  and potential new customers may not choose  to outsource any of their test systems and service requirements 
if the market for telecommunications test systems and services  or the demand for outsourcing  declines or fails to grow  or if our products and services are not widely adopted as a telecommunications test solution  our business  financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  administrative and operational resources 
to manage expansion effectively  we need to continue to develop and improve our operational and financial systems  sales and marketing capabilities and expand  train  retain  manage and motivate our employee base 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may not be able to successfully exploit future market opportunities or successfully manage our relationships with customers and other third parties 
we may not continue to grow and  if we do  we may not effectively manage such growth 
any failure to manage growth could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a significant portion of our sales is to customers outside the united states 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from customers outside of north america  and we maintain operations in seven other countries 
international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks  including longer customer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  changes in regulatory requirements or in economic or trade policy  costs related to localizing products for foreign countries  potentially weaker protection for intellectual property in certain foreign countries  
table of contents the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and practices  tariffs and other trade barriers  and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
during the last three fiscal years  a significant portion of our international sales has been to customers in japan 
if economic conditions in japan deteriorate  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in foreign markets on a timely basis could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales  including all our sales in japan  is denominated in local currencies 
although we currently engage in hedging transactions with respect to receivables resulting from some inter company sales  we may not continue to do so and our hedging activities may not be successful 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may contribute to fluctuations in our operating results 
for example  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect the revenues  net income  earnings per share and cash flow of our operations in affected markets 
similarly  such fluctuations may cause us to raise prices  which could affect demand for our products and services 
in addition  if exchange or price controls or other restrictions are imposed in countries in which we do business  our business  financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions we may make of other companies  products or technologies 
as part of our business strategy  we acquired tekelec s network diagnostics business in  and we may make further acquisitions of  or significant investments in  companies  products or technologies that we believe are complementary 
any such transactions would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in making acquisitions of companies  products and technologies 
such risks include  among others difficulties associated with assimilating the personnel and operations of acquired companies  potential disruption of our ongoing business  distraction of management and other resources  integration of personnel and technology of an acquired company  difficulties in evaluating the technology of a potential target  inability to motivate and retain new personnel  maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and impairment of relationships with employees and clients as a result of the integration of new management personnel 
we have limited experience in assimilating acquired companies or product lines into our operations 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any such future acquisitions 
furthermore  any future acquisitions could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and operating results or decrease the value of our common stock 
we face intense competition in our markets from more established test solutions providers  and if we are unable to compete successfully we may not be able to maintain or grow our business 
the market for our products is highly competitive 
a number of our competitors are better known and have substantially greater financial  technological  production and marketing resources than we do 
while we believe that the price performance characteristics of our products are competitive  competition in the markets for our products could force us to reduce prices 
any material reduction in the price of our products without 
table of contents corresponding decreases in manufacturing costs and increases in unit volume would negatively affect our gross margins 
increased competition for our products that results in lower product sales could also adversely impact our upgrade sales 
our ability to maintain our competitive position will depend upon  among other factors  our success in anticipating industry trends  investing in product research and development  developing new products with improved price performance characteristics and effectively managing the introduction of new products into targeted markets 
we have experienced delays in completing our new chameleon product  which could result in lost sales opportunities and lower financial results 
we originally introduced our new chameleon product in february and announced our intention to begin shipping this product to customers in may for beta testing 
however  due to delays associated with development and testing  we only began beta testing in the fourth calendar quarter of this delay may have caused us to miss a portion of the market window for chameleon as we believe that mobile telecommunications operators may have made or may make many of their key g maintenance procurement decisions before chameleon is shipped commercially 
our success depends on the continued growth of the telecommunications industry and increased use of our test solutions  and lack of growth in this industry could harm our business 
our future success is dependent upon the continued growth of the telecommunications industry 
the global telecommunications industry is evolving rapidly  and it is difficult to predict its potential growth rate or future trends in technology development 
the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide telecommunications market that have resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced telecommunications equipment may not continue at its current rate or at all 
our future success depends upon the increased utilization of our test solutions by network operators and telecommunications equipment manufacturers 
industry wide network equipment and infrastructure development driving the demand for our products and services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors  including cost  regulatory obstacles or the lack of or reduction in consumer demand for advanced telecommunications products and services 
telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators may not develop new technology or enhance current technology 
further  any such new technology or enhancements may not lead to greater demand for our products or services 
our business could be harmed if we were to lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our future growth and success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing services of our executive officers and other key employees 
we do not have long term employment agreements or non competition agreements with any of our employees 
competition for qualified management and other high level telecommunications industry personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
if we lose the services of any key employees  we may not be able to manage our business successfully or achieve our business objectives 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical  sales  finance and management personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed 

table of contents our ability to deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent on our ability to meet new and changing requirements for telecommunications test systems and services 
the market for telecommunications test systems and services is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  rapid changes in customer requirements and frequent product and service introductions and enhancements 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes by enhancing our existing products and services and by developing and introducing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of our customer base 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
in addition  because of the rapid technological change characteristic of the telecommunications industry  we may be required to support legacy systems used by our customers 
as a result  this may place additional demands on our personnel and other resources and may require us to maintain an inventory of otherwise obsolete components 
our test systems currently operate only on sun microsystems s solaris tm and the linux tm operating systems 
our current and prospective customers may require other operating systems  such as windows or windows xp  to be used in their telecommunications test systems or may require the integration of other industry standards 
we may not be able to successfully adapt our products to such operating systems on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
our failure to respond to rapidly changing technologies and to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner could adversely affect our operations and overall profitability 
our success will depend in part on whether a large number of telecommunications equipment manufacturers and network operators purchase our products and services 
because the telecommunications market is rapidly evolving  it is difficult to predict the future success of products and services in this market 
the customers in this market use products from a number of competing suppliers for various testing purposes  and there has not been broad adoption of the products of one company 
our current or future products or services may not achieve widespread acceptance among telecommunications equipment manufacturers  network operators or other potential customers 
in addition  our competitors may develop solutions that could render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
in the event the telecommunications industry does not broadly adopt our products or services or does so less rapidly than we expect  or in the event our products are rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by more advanced solutions  our business  financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 
many of our suppliers are sole source or single source suppliers  and our inability to obtain adequate amounts of components from these suppliers could harm our business 
we purchase many key components  including certain microprocessors  workstations  bus interface and other chips  connectors and other hardware  from the sole supplier of a particular component 
for other components  even though multiple vendors may exist  we may purchase components from only a single source 
we do not have any long term supply agreements with these vendors to ensure uninterrupted supply of these components 
if our supply of a key component is reduced or interrupted  we might require a significant amount of time to qualify alternative suppliers and receive an adequate flow of replacement components 
we may also need to reconfigure our products to adapt to new components  which could entail substantial time and expense 
in addition  the process of manufacturing certain of these components is extremely complex  and our reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes us to potential production difficulties and quality variations 
these could negatively affect cost and timely delivery of our products 
we have in the past experienced supply problems as a result of the financial or operational difficulties of our suppliers  shortages and discontinuations resulting from component obsolescence 
although to date we have not experienced material delays in product deliveries to our customers resulting from supply problems  such problems may recur or  if such problems do recur  we may not find satisfactory solutions 
if we are unable to obtain adequate amounts of fully functional 
table of contents components or are otherwise required to seek alternative sources of supply  our relationship with our customers and our results of operations could be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of independent manufacturers  which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process 
we rely on a limited number of independent manufacturers  some of which are small  privately held companies  to provide certain assembly services to our specifications 
we do not have any long term supply agreements with any third party manufacturer 
if our assembly services are reduced or interrupted  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected until we are able to establish sufficient assembly services supply from alternative sources 
alternative manufacturing sources may not be able to meet our future requirements  and existing or alternative sources may not continue to be available to us at favorable prices 
the high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects  which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
our complex products may contain undetected errors or bugs  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
errors may be found in future releases of our software 
in addition  any such errors may generate adverse publicity  impair the market acceptance of these products  create customer concerns or adversely affect operating results due to product returns  the costs of generating corrective releases or otherwise 
we face exposure to product liability claims  which if successful could harm our business 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
however  it is possible that the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements may not be effective under the laws of certain jurisdictions  particularly since we sell a majority of our products internationally 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  our sale and support of products may entail the risk of such claims 
we may be subject to such claims in the future 
a successful product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain adequate product liability insurance and if we were to lose a large uninsured claim  then such a loss could significantly harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success is dependent on our ability to protect our intellectual property  and our failure to protect our intellectual property could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
our success and ability to compete effectively are dependent in part upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
to date  we have generally not sought patent protection for our proprietary technology 
patent protection may become more significant in our industry in the future 
likewise  the measures we undertake may not be adequate to protect our proprietary technology 
to date  we have federally registered certain of our trademarks or copyrights 
our practice is to affix copyright notices on software  hardware and product literature in order to assert copyright protection for these works 
the lack of federal registration of all of our trademarks and copyrights may have an adverse effect on our intellectual property rights in the future 
additionally  we may be subject to further risks as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are unavailable  do not provide adequate protection or are difficult to enforce 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
our steps to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such technology  and may not preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to our products 
if we fail to protect our proprietary technology  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed significantly 

table of contents we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property  which could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
the telecommunications industry is characterized by a relatively high level of litigation based on allegations of infringement of proprietary rights 
while to date we have not been subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property by third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us 
in addition  an assertion of infringement may result in litigation in which we may not prevail 
furthermore  any such claims  with or without merit  could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our personnel 
in addition  infringement claims may require us to develop new technology or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
because we do not rely on patents to protect our technology  we will not be able to offer a license for patented technology in connection with any settlement of patent infringement lawsuits 
if a claim of infringement or misappropriation against us were successful and we fail or are unable to develop non infringing technology or license any infringed  misappropriated or similar technology at a reasonable cost  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  we indemnify our customers against claimed infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other proprietary rights of third parties 
any requirement for us to indemnify a customer may significantly harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends on the timely development and introduction of new products 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing industry standards and customer requirements by enhancing our existing products and services 
we may need to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products  features and services that address the needs of our customer base 
we may not be successful in identifying  developing and marketing new products  product enhancements and related services that respond to technological change or evolving industry standards or that adequately meet new market demands 
if we are unable to determine and demonstrate that we maintain effective controls over internal financial reporting  this may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and the price of our stock could drop significantly 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  beginning with our fiscal year ending september   we will be required to include in our annual report on form k an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting together with a report from our independent registered public accountants on our assessment 
in the course of preparing our assessment  we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
risks related to our stock sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our major stockholders and others could adversely affect the market price of our common stock sales of substantial numbers of shares of common stock by our major stockholders in the public market could harm the market price for our common stock 
as of november   richard a 
karp  our chief executive office and chairman of our board  beneficially owned  shares  and nancy h 
karp  one of our directors  beneficially owned  shares of our common stock 
these shares are eligible for resale into the public market within the restrictions imposed by rule under the securities act of sales of a 
table of contents significant amount of these shares could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
in connection with our public offering in september  all of our directors and officers entered into lock ups terminating december  these lockups were waived with respect to dr 
karp and ms 
karp in connection with their sales of stock in october and november  and may be waived as to any other holder at the discretion of the underwriters of our public offering 
dr 
karp and ms 
karp entered into new lock ups terminating february  in addition  we have requested on behalf of certain officers and directors that the underwriters waive the lock ups with respect to  shares of our common stock 
our stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
in recent years  the stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular  including our common stock  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors such as quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in our revenue growth rates as a whole or for specific geographic areas or products  changes in earning estimates by market analysts  changes in the extent to which a significant percentage of our shares are held by a small number of investors  the announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  speculation in the press or analyst community  and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
the market price of our common stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future 
our principal stockholder could prevent or delay a change in control 
as of november   dr 
karp beneficially owned  shares or approximately of our common stock outstanding 
such a concentration of ownership and voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the control of our company 
provisions in our charter documents and nevada law could prevent or delay a change in the control of our company and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
nevada law  our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a proxy contest or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors is authorized to issue  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock with voting  conversion and other rights and preferences that may be superior to those of the common stock and that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock or rights to purchase preferred stock could be used to discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
if we are required in the future to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans  the resultant ongoing accounting charges would significantly reduce our reported net income and net income per share  and the price of our stock could drop significantly 
on october   the financial accounting standards board fasb concluded that proposed statement r  share based payment  which would require all companies to measure compensation expense for all share based payments including employee stock options at fair value  will be effective  if it is adopted by the fasb  for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after june  adoption of fasb statement r would require us to record an expense for stock based compensation plans and would result in ongoing accounting charges that would significantly reduce our net income 
see the section 
table of contents entitled stock based compensation in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s foreign exchange risk and derivative financial instruments our foreign subsidiaries operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts  and we infrequently use options  to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates that affect certain foreign currency denominated inter company receivables or expected revenues 
the forward contracts and options are not designated as accounting hedges 
we attempt to match the forward contracts with the underlying receivables in terms of currency  amount and maturity  and to match the options with expected foreign currency revenue in terms of currency  amount and recognition period 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
because the impact of movements in currency exchange rates on forward contracts and options generally offsets the related impact on the exposures economically hedged  these derivative financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
gains and losses on forward exchange contracts generally offset the foreign exchange transaction gains or losses from revaluation of foreign currency denominated amounts receivable 
gains on options generally offset the opportunity cost of foreign currency revenue recognized at an exchange rate less favorable than the option rate 
to date  we have not fully mitigated all risk associated with our revenues and resulting accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies  and there can be no assurance that our mitigation activities  if any  will be successful 
at september   we had forward exchange contracts maturing in fiscal to sell approximately million in japanese yen designed to mitigate the risk of future movements in foreign exchange rates relating to intercompany accounts receivable 
there were no options outstanding at that date 
the fair market value of these contracts at september  was not material 
we have evaluated the potential near term losses in future earnings  fair values and cash flows from reasonably possible near term currency fluctuations  and we believe that any such losses would not be material 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
as of september   cash equivalents and short term investments consisted of available for sale securities of million see note balance sheet components in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these fixed income marketable securities included corporate and municipal bonds and government securities  all of which are of high investment grade 
they are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if the market interest rates increase 
if the market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of september   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position
