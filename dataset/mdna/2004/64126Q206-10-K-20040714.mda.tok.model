changes in previously issued financial statements during the year ended march   and subsequent to the issuance of the company s financial statements as of march   it was determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the company s convertible credit facility and certain warrants and options had not been appropriately valued and accounted for 
the following describes the appropriate accounting and the changes made to the company s financial statements 
credit facility conversion feature and certain warrants 
in the fiscal year ended march   the company entered into a million credit facility  which was amended in the fiscal year ended march  to increase the facility to million the credit facility 
a portion of the principal balance of the credit facility was convertible into common stock from time to time at the option of the holder 
the intrinsic value of the conversion feature of the credit facility normally is characterized as a beneficial conversion feature 
the company determined the value of the beneficial conversion feature of cumulative drawdowns under the credit facility to be an aggregate of million 
principal of the credit facility was drawn down beginning in the fiscal year ended march  and continuing through the fiscal year ended march  accordingly  the company discounted the balance of the credit facility as of the date of each drawdown and is amortizing the beneficial conversion feature associated with each drawdown from the date of each drawdown to the maturity date of the credit facility 
in the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  multiple warrants were issued to a financial advisor instrumental in securing the credit facility collectively  the warrants 
each warrant was immediately vested and exercisable subject to certain restrictions 
the company ascribed an estimated fair value of the warrants in the aggregate amount of million 
accordingly  the company capitalized deferred loan issue costs as of the date of issuance of each warrant and such costs are being amortized from the date of each issuance to the maturity date of the credit facility 
it was also determined that  in the calculation of the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  certain convertibility restrictions imposed by the credit facility on the lender and certain exercise restrictions imposed on the warrants had been interpreted as more restrictive than they actually were  resulting in an overstatement of diluted earnings per share beginning in the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march  have been restated from amounts previously reported to correct the accounting for these transactions 
the company has recorded a beneficial conversion feature debt discount associated with its credit facility and deferred loan issue costs associated with the warrants 
amortization of the debt discount is being accounted for using the effective interest method and is being charged to interest expense 
the deferred loan issue costs are being amortized over the life of the credit facility on a straight line basis and are being charged to amortization of deferred loan issue cost expenses 
additional paid in capital and retained earnings as of april  have also been restated to reflect prior period adjustments to those reported amounts through that date 
the prior period adjustment increased additional paid in capital by approximately million and was attributable to the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of the credit facility and warrants 
the prior period adjustment decreased retained earnings by  net of taxes  to properly reflect the amortization of the beneficial conversion feature to interest expense and the amortization of the deferred loan costs to expense through the end of the fiscal year ended march  certain options and warrants 
in the fiscal years ending march   march  and march   certain options and warrants were issued to other advisors and consultants collectively  the options 
the options were immediately vested and exercisable 
the company ascribed a fair value for the options in the aggregate amount of  costs related to these options were expensed in the period granted 
additional paid in capital and retained earnings as of april  have also been restated to reflect prior period adjustments to those reported amounts through that date 
the prior period adjustment increased additional paid in capital by  and was attributable to the fair value of the options 
the prior period adjustment decreased retained earnings by  net of taxes  to properly reflect the impact of the options expenses through the end of the fiscal year ending march  certain tax benefits 
the company determined that certain tax benefits associated with the exercise of common stock options and warrants that occurred during each of the fiscal years ended march  and march  were not considered 
as a result  the amount of the deferred tax liability was overstated and the amount of additional paid in capital and total stockholders equity was understated as of march  and by  and  respectively 
also  we have determined that our investment in route casinos  llc should be accounted for using the equity method because our venture partner continues to control the operating activities of the venture  even though  in the opinion of management  such is a breach of the operating agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from credit risk concentrations 
we do not believe we are subject to material interest rate risk or foreign currency risk 
we have utilized draws under our credit facilities to make loans to dry creek casino  llc  which has made loans to the river rock casino 
if the river rock casino is unable to make its debt payments to the dry creek casino  llc for any reason  the dry creek casino llc will be unable to make its required debt repayment to us  which will affect our ability to repay our credit facility 
we currently believe that this is our primary credit risk 
as our credit facilities are fixed interest rate instruments  an interest rate change would not have any impact on our operations 
our interest in rci is dependent on rci s valuation  which is subject to the value of the real  the brazilian currency  which has been subject to rapid fluctuations 
however  we do not believe the results of rci s operations will have a material effect on our financial operations
