item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of our financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary information and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general overview edge petroleum corporation is a houston based independent energy company that focuses its exploration  production and marketing activities in selected onshore basins of the united states 
we were organized as a delaware corporation in august in connection with our initial public offering the offering and the related combination of certain entities that held interests in the edge joint venture ii the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties  herein referred to as the combination 
in a series of combination transactions  we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received in exchange of the ownership interests in the joint venture and certain other oil and natural gas properties 
in march  and contemporaneously with the combination  we completed the offering of  shares of our common stock generating proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses 
we undertook a top level management change late in and began a shift in strategy from pure exploration which focused more on prospect generation to our current strategy which focuses on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation and development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
in december  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of miller exploration company miller 
the transaction was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination 
in the merger  we issued approximately million shares of edge common stock using a ratio of edge shares for each share of miller common stock outstanding 
miller continues to conduct operating activities as a wholly owned subsidiary of edge 
because the merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination  the financial and operating results presented in this report on form k include miller only for the period subsequent to the merger on december  industry and economic factors in managing our business  we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is the fluctuation of oil and gas prices 
historically  oil and gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  with future price movements which are difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  it is wide swings in prices that have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  we may still not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reservoirs being discovered 
moreover  costs associated with operating within our industry are substantial 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas businesses and individual operators 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth of our business will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves in a cost effective manner 
in order to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we maintain a blended portfolio of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we also attempt to make selected acquisitions of oil and gas properties to augment our growth 
we believe that this approach should allow for consistent increases in our oil and gas reserves  while minimizing the chance of failure 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
we periodically hedge our exposure to volatile oil and gas prices on a portion of our production to reduce price risk 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities and external sources of capital 
in late  we announced plans for record capital expenditures of approximately million for all of which we expect to fund from internally generated cash flows from operating activities 
in  edge reported a increase in proved reserves  a increase in annual production volumes and a reserve replacement ratio 
production in the fourth quarter was higher than in the previous quarter and we exited with a record daily production rate 
a strong financial position as represented by a debt to total capital ratio of  available unused borrowing capacity and increasing cash flow from our growing production volumes as a result of three separate acquisitions in the second half of will help lay the ground work for our activities in operationally and financially  we believe edge is well positioned to continue the execution of our business strategies during critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key estimates used by management include revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize oil and natural gas revenue from our interests in producing wells as oil and natural gas is produced and sold from those wells 
oil and natural gas sold by us is not significantly different from our share of production 
oil and natural gas properties the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred whereas under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method to determine impairment the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period and derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized within a cost center 
our oil and natural gas properties are located within the united states of america which constitutes one cost center 
although some of these costs may ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
oil and natural gas properties are amortized using the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserve quantities 
investments in unproved properties are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the prospects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
unproved properties are evaluated periodically for impairment on a property by property basis 
if the results of an assessment indicated that an unproved property is impaired  the amount of impairment is added to the proved oil and natural gas property costs to be amortized 
the amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage value 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interests method 
in july  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review of impairment 
the new standard also requires that  at a minimum  all intangible assets be aggregated and presented as a separate line item in the balance sheet 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
and to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
this issue is currently on the emerging issues task force eitf agenda as issue s  applicability of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
and require registrants to classify the costs of acquiring contractual mineral or drilling rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets on the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  we have included the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  we would be required to reclassify approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
these costs include those to acquire contract based drilling and mineral use rights such as delay rentals  lease bonuses  commissions and brokerage fees  and other leasehold costs 
our cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules  as allowed by sfas no 
further  we do not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on our compliance with covenants under our debt agreements 
the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are subject to a ceiling test  whereby to the extent that such capitalized costs subject to amortization in the full cost pool net of depletion  depreciation and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net after tax cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves using hedge adjusted period end prices  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  an impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties is assessed on a quarterly basis in conjunction with our quarterly filings with the securities and exchange commission 
no adjustment related to the ceiling test was required during the years ended december    or sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
under the full cost method of accounting  the fair value of the abandonment obligations  net of salvage value  are currently included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires us to record a separate liability upon the incurrence of an obligation for the fair value of our asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet 
inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assump tions impact the fair value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
required a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception  which resulted in a loss of  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  since we added these costs for asset retirement obligations using a cumulative effect approach there are no comparable costs shown in the costs incurred disclosures for prior periods presented  therefore finding cost calculations are not directly comparable between periods presented 
going forward  our depletion expense will be reduced since we will deplete a discounted amount of asset retirement costs rather than the undiscounted value depleted in previous years 
the lower depletion expense under sfas no 
is offset  however  by accretion expense 
oil and natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in the future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense and accretion expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to prepare our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
derivatives and hedging activities our revenue  profitability and future rate of growth and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  and the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
these prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and access to capital  as well as the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we may economically produce 
due to the interaction of these factors on the stability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors for a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure from price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements limits our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also reduces our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
our hedging arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices and limits our potential gains from future increases in prices 
our management sets all of our hedging policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counter parties  on a quarterly basis 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors reviews all hedging policies and trades 
we account for these transactions as hedging activities and  accordingly  realized gains and losses are included in oil and natural gas revenue during the period the hedged transactions occur 
see items and business and properties marketing 
we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions 
in the event it is determined that the use of a particular derivative may not be or has ceased to be effective in pursuing a hedging strategy  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
stock based compensation we account for stock compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
no compensation expense is recognized for stock options that had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of their underlying common stock on the date of grant 
as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we have continued to apply apb opinion no 
for purposes of determining net income 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
we elected not to change to the fair value method 
additionally  the statement amended the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are also subject to reporting requirements of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation that requires a non cash charge to deferred compensation expense if the market price of our common stock at the end of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain stock options 
after the first such adjustment is made  each subsequent period is adjusted upward or downward to the extent that the market price exceeds the exercise price of the options 
the charge is related to non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years in conjunction with the repricing of those options 
results of operations this section includes discussion of our  and results of operations 
we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and production of oil and natural gas 
our resources and assets are managed and our results reported as one operating segment 
we conduct our operations primarily along the onshore united states  gulf coast  with our primary emphasis in south texas  louisiana and se new mexico 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue increased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and natural gas liquid ngl production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue

this adjustment resulted in mmcfe of additional production and  of additional revenue 
includes the effect of hedging 
our revenue is sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have a dramatic effect on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability  availability of alternative fuels  the economy  weather and other factors outside of our control could impact supply and demand 
natural gas revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for due to significantly higher average realized prices coupled with an increase in production  partially offset by a higher realized hedge loss 
including the effect of our hedges  our average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this increase in average price received resulted in increased revenue of approximately million based on production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   average natural gas production increased from mcf d in to mcf d in due to production from new wells drilled and acquired  primarily our o connor ranch east  gato creek and encinitas properties  partially offset by natural declines at our austin field and o connor ranch properties 
this increase in production compared to the prior year resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the prior year total of million 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in higher average prices for the year resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on production 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the increase in oil and condensate production resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of million 
higher average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in an increase in revenue of  based on production 
the average realized price for ngls for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel for the same period in production volumes for ngls increased  from bbls d for the year ended december  to bbls d for the year ended december  due primarily to new production from the thibodeaux well

the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   higher oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year without a corresponding increase in reserves 
depreciation of furniture and fixtures totaled  a decrease of compared to the prior year total of  we adopted sfas no 
 effective january   and as a result  we recorded accretion expense associated with our asset retirement obligation of  for the year ended december  compared to zero in due to this change in accounting for asset retirement obligations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
total general and administrative g a for the year ended december  was million  an increase of compared to the prior year total of million 
total g a costs include deferred compensation related to repriced options  deferred compensation related to restricted stock grants and other g a costs 
deferred compensation expense consists of costs reported in accordance with fin and amortization related to restricted stock awards 
a fin charge of million was incurred for the year ended december  compared to a charge of  in the comparable prior year period 
fin requires  among other things  a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
we adjust deferred compensation expense upward or downward on a monthly basis based on the trading price at the end of each such period 
we are required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and re priced in may of  as well as certain newly issued options in conjunction with the repricing 
amortization related to restricted stock awards granted over the past three years totaled  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and other g a for the year ended december   which does not include the deferred compensation expenses discussed above  totaled million  a increase from the total of million 
the increase in other g a was attributable to higher audit and legal fees  higher franchise taxes  office moving costs and the settlement of a lawsuit related to seismic rights in april for  in addition  we incurred costs associated with the miller merger of  including retention  salaries and benefits  and integration costs and implementation costs to integrate our production and land computer systems with accounting of  these costs were partially offset by lower rent and parking and lower reserve engineer fees compared to the prior year periods

at december   our unproved property balance was million compared to million at december   resulting in the lower capitalized interest for also included in interest expense for the year ended december  was  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with our credit facility 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease in interest income is due primarily to the overall decrease in rates at which the funds are invested in overnight money market funds 
an income tax provision was recorded for the year ended december  of million 
due to changes in permanent differences  including meals and entertainment and compensation expense  our effective tax rate changed from in to in as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated or acquired that begin to expire in for the year ended december   an income tax provision of  was recorded 
currently  we do not anticipate making federal tax payments in upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principal of  net of income taxes of  and accretion expense  to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depletion and accretion 
for the year ended december   we had net income of million  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  as compared to net income of  or basic and diluted earnings per share in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during the impact of the shares issued in the miller transaction will not be fully realized until next year since the merger closed and the shares were issued in december year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue and production oil and natural gas revenue decreased from million in to million in for  natural gas production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  oil and condensate comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue  and ngl production comprised of total production and contributed of total revenue

natural gas revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for significantly lower realized prices coupled with a decline in production for the year were slightly offset by a lower realized hedge loss 
including the effect of hedges  our average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for excluding the effect of hedges  the average natural gas sales price for production in was per mcf compared to per mcf for this decrease in average price received resulted in decreased revenue of approximately million based on production 
included within natural gas revenue for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  representing losses from hedging activity 
these losses decreased the effective natural gas sales price by per mcf and per mcf  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   natural gas production decreased from mcf d in to mcf d in due primarily to natural declines in production at our austin field and o connor ranch properties  partially offset by increased production from new wells drilled in late and in this decrease in production compared to the prior year resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period prices 
revenue from the sale of oil and condensate totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of from the prior year total of million 
the average realized price for oil and condensate for the year ended december  was per barrel compared to per barrel in lower average prices for the year resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately  based on production 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to bbls d for the year ended december  compared to bbls d for the same prior year period 
the increase in oil and condensate production resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately  based on comparable period average prices 
revenue from the sale of ngls totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of from the total of million 
production volumes for ngls increased  from bbls d for the year ended december  to bbls d for the year ended december  the increase in ngl production increased revenue by million based on comparable period average prices 
this increase in production was largely due to increased liquids processing stemming from gato creek field webb county  texas  an acquisition made in late lower average realized prices for the year ended december  resulted in a decrease in revenue of million based on production

operating expenses averaged per mcfe for the year ended december  compared to per mcfe for the prior year period 
severance and ad valorem taxes for the year ended december  decreased from million in  to million in severance tax expense for was lower than the prior year period as a result of lower revenue as well as severance tax exemption credits on certain properties 
for the year ended december   severance tax expense was approximately of total revenue compared to of total revenue for the comparable period 
ad valorem costs  however  increased from approximately  in to over  in due primarily to additional costs on the ibarra and la jolla parr properties as well as the gato creek properties which were acquired at year end on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes averaged per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december  and  respectively

the higher depletion rate per mcfe resulted in an increase in depletion expense of million 
for the year ended december   lower oil and natural gas production compared to the prior year period resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of million 
the increase in the depletion rate was primarily due to a higher amortizable base in compared to the prior year 
in december  we recorded costs of million related to the settlement of our litigation with bnp 
deferred compensation expense consists of costs reported in accordance with fin  and amortization related to restricted stock awards

included in other income expense was interest expense of  for the year ended december  compared to  in the same period 
interest expense  including facility fees  was  for on weighted average debt of million compared to interest expense of  on weighted average debt of approximately million for the same prior year period 
capitalized interest for the year ended december  increased to  compared to  in the prior year due primarily to higher interest costs on higher outstanding debt for the period 
also included in interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  representing amortization of deferred loan costs associated with a new credit facility 
interest income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease in interest income is due primarily to the overall decrease in funds invested in overnight money market funds 
an income tax provision was recorded for the year ended december  of  as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards had been accumulated that begin to expire in for the year ended december   an income tax benefit of  was recorded as a result of reversing a valuation reserve 
we did not make federal tax payments in for the year ended december   the company had net income of million  or basic earnings per share  as compared to net income of million  or basic earnings per share  in weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million in the comparable period 
the increase was due primarily to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during acquisitions on august  we closed the acquisition of oil and gas properties in our core south texas area for million paid in cash 
the purchase price was funded from existing working capital and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the acquisition consisted of interests averaging between and in gross net wells covering  gross  net acres 
as of december   the estimated proved reserves associated with the interests acquired was bcfe 
estimated daily production as of december  was mmcfe per day 
the reserves and production stream are approximately natural gas 
on november  we closed the acquisition of oil and gas properties in our core south texas area for million paid in cash 
the purchase price was funded from existing working capital and borrowings under our existing credit facility 
the acquisition consisted of interests averaging between and in gross net wells covering gross net acres 
as of december   the estimated proved reserves associated with the interests acquired was bcfe 
estimated current daily production is mmcfe 
the reserves and production stream are approximately natural gas 
exploration alliance on august   we entered into a new exploration alliance to jointly explore for oil and natural gas in the southeast new mexico portion of the permian basin with two private oil and gas companies 
edge and its co explorers agreed to the establishment of an area of mutual interest the ami covering all of eddy and lea counties  as well as a portion of southern chaves county 
within the ami  our partners own approximately  gross  net acres of mineral fee and leasehold  which they have committed to the exploration alliance 
we will act as operator for the exploration alliance and earn  subject to fulfillment of certain obligations  an assignment of an undivided working interest and a net revenue interest  proportionately reduced  in all acreage owned in the ami 
in order to earn the interests in the ami properties  we will pay a total fee of million  million paid at closing and the balance to be paid in equal monthly installments  and commit to the drilling of four grayburg san andres and six atoka morrow wells within an month time period and carry our partners for approximately million in well costs 
all subsequent wells  new leasehold acreage and any other acquisitions will be done on a pro rata basis by all parties 
merger on december  we completed our acquisition of miller exploration company miller 
miller was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with exploration efforts concentrated primarily in the mississippi salt basin of central mississippi 
we acquired miller for the development and exploitation projects in each of miller s core areas  increased financial flexibility  and expansion of our core areas 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each share of issued and outstanding common stock of miller was converted into shares of edge common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of edge common stock to the shareholders of miller in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of miller 
the merger was treated as a tax free reorganization and accounted for as a purchase business combination under generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value of assets acquired from miller totaled million and included million of cash 
we incurred million in costs associated with the merger resulting in cash acquired in the merger of million 
the acquired miller properties are estimated to contain at least bcfe of proved reserves at december   of which approximately was natural gas and was classified as proved developed 
we will operate the majority of the acquired properties 
the acreage position was approximately  gross  net acres with an option to acquire  gross  net acres at december  divestitures we regularly review our asset base for the purpose of identifying non core assets  the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies 
while we generally do not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt  such dispositions can have the result of furthering our objective of financial flexibility through reduced debt levels 
during  and  our divestitures consisted of the sales of oil and gas properties for net proceeds of   and  respectively 
our net proceeds from asset divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of our interest in affiliated entities  essex i and ii joint ventures see note to our consolidated financial statements  and certain oil and gas properties in texas and louisiana 
our divestitures were primarily derived from the sale of certain interests in oil and gas properties in texas  alabama  montana  and louisiana 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we completed our initial public offering which provided us with proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses and on may   we completed a private offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we also issued warrants  which were purchased for per warrant  to acquire an additional  shares of common stock at per share and are exercisable through may  total proceeds  net of offering costs  were approximately million of which million was used to repay debt under our revolving credit facility in place at the time  with the remainder being utilized to satisfy working capital requirements and to fund a portion of our exploration program 
pursuant to the terms of the private placement  we filed a registration statement with the commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock and the warrants sold in the private placement  as well as the resale of any shares of common stock issued pursuant to such warrants 
on november   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants  which resulted in proceeds to us of  on november   we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants  which resulted in proceeds to us of  on december   we issued an additional  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants  which resulted in additional proceeds to us of  on december   we issued an additional  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of warrants  which resulted in additional proceeds to us of  as of december    of these warrants were outstanding 
on march   mr 
elias  our chairman and chief executive officer exercised the remaining warrants which resulted in our issuance to him of  shares of common stock and net proceeds to us of  our primary ongoing source of capital is the cash flow generated from our operating activities supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
both of these sources are directly impacted by the amount of our oil and gas reserves  production volumes and the prices we receive 
reserves and production volumes are influenced  in part  by the amount of future capital expenditures 
our primary uses of capital have been and will continue to be funding our exploration and development projects and acquisitions as well as retirement of outstanding debt 
in turn  capital expenditures are influenced by many factors including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which oil and gas properties are acquired 
capital resources our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  and the repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
we attempt to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budget capital expenditures based on projected cash flows 
we routinely adjust capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  and cash flow 
we typically have funded acquisitions from borrowings under our credit facility and cash flow from operations 
we have historically utilized net cash provided by operating activities  debt and equity as capital resources to obtain necessary funding for all of our cash needs 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to higher oil and gas revenue partially offset by higher operating expense 
oil and gas revenue increased with a increase in the average price received for our production and a increase in production 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared to was due primarily to lower net income in  a larger decrease in accrued liabilities for and a lower decrease in accounts receivable for as compared to net cash generated from operating activities is a function of commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  production and capital spending 
our business  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or we  and a critical source of our future liquidity  will shrink 
based on the year end reserve life index  our production decline rate is approximately per year 
this projection assumes the capital investment  prices  costs and taxes reflected in our standardized measure in note to our consolidated financial statements 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows and  therefore capital budgets 
for these reasons  we only forecast  for internal use by management  an annual cash flow 
these annual forecasts are revised monthly and capital budgets are reviewed by management and adjusted as warranted by market conditions 
longer term cash flow and capital spending projections are neither developed nor used by management to operate our business 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items and business and properties risk factors our operations have significant capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million of cash received in the miller merger net of merger costs incurred see discussion above and million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs  excluding miller  totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million for the year ended december   were partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties during capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million in expenditures was attributable to land holdings  including million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities  all of which were capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of million were attributed to drilling gross wells  of which were successful 
acquisition costs totaled million for the year ended december   and an additional million was attributable to land holdings  including million for seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office equipment 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately million is allocated to our expected drilling and production activities  million is allocated to land and seismic activities  and million relates to capitalized interest  g a and other 
we plan to fund these expenditures from expected cash flow from operations plus some modest incremental borrowings 
we have not explicitly budgeted for acquisitions  however  we do expect to spend considerable effort evaluating acquisition opportunities 
we expect to fund acquisitions through traditional reserve based bank debt and or the issuance of equity and  if required  through additional debt and equity financings 
we currently have million of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our current credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options and warrants exercised in cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december  including million in borrowings and million in repayments under our credit facility 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in cash flows provided by financing activities in were million  including borrowings of million and repayments of million under our credit facility 
in addition  we received  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in due to our active exploration  development and acquisition activities  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience substantial working capital requirements 
we intend to fund our capital expenditures  commitments and working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  and to the extent necessary other financing activities 
the projected cash flows from operations are estimated to be sufficient to fund our budgeted exploration and development program 
we believe we will be able to generate capital resources and liquidity sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and meet such financial obligations as they come due 
credit facility in march  the company entered into a new amended and restated credit facility the credit facility  effective december   which permits borrowings up to the lesser of i the borrowing base and ii million 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to prime plus or libor plus 
at that time the borrowing base under the credit facility was also increased to million  effective december   as a result of the acquisition of properties in the miller merger and our drilling activities since the last redetermination 
upon entering into the new credit facility  our available borrowing capacity was million 
we expect to redetermine our existing borrowing base in the second quarter of  and semiannually thereafter 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures december  and is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  and engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility also prohibits dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens 
the credit facility also contains certain financial covenants 
the ebitdax to interest expense ratio requires that a our consolidated ebitdax defined as ebitda less similar non cash items and exploration and abandonment expenses for such period for the four fiscal quarters then ended to b our consolidated interest expense for the four fiscal quarters then ended  to not be less than to the working capital ratio requires that the amount of our consolidated current assets less our consolidated current liabilities  as defined in the agreement  be at least million 
the maximum leverage ratio requires that the ratio  as of the last day of any fiscal quarter  of a total indebtedness as defined in the credit facility as of such fiscal quarter to b an amount equal to consolidated ebitdax for the two quarters then ended times two  shall not be greater than to consolidated ebitdax is a component of negotiated covenants with our lenders and is presented here as part of the company s disclosure of its covenant obligations

contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  by payment due date less than after total year years years years in thousands long term debt   operating leases    other liabilities exploration alliance   total contractual cash obligations     the company did not have any capital leases or purchase obligations as of december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of business enterprises to which the usual condition ownership of a majority voting interest of consolidation does not apply 
this interpretation focuses on controlling financial interests that may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
it concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
we share interests with related parties in a variety of different partnership and joint venture entities in order to share the rewards of ownership in certain oil and natural gas royalties 
we do not provide supplemental financial support to these entities nor do we have voting rights 
in general  these entities are structured such that the voting and sharing ratios in these entities are consistent with the allocation of the entities distributions of cash from royalty revenues 
we are not impacted by fin because there is no investment in or obligation to share in future capital requirements of these entities 
on september   we sold our interests in two of these entities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the factors above  the adoption of the above mentioned standard did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
hedging activities in december  we entered into a costless natural gas collar covering  mmbtu per day for the period january  to march  with a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
at december  the market value of this instrument was approximately  and is included in current assets 
in august  we purchased natural gas options that cover  mmbtus per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu for the first and fourth quarters of and per mmbtu for the second and third quarters of for a cost of  at december  the market value of this instrument was approximately  and is included in current assets 
in april  we entered into a natural gas collar covering  mmbtu per day for the period june  to september  with a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
this collar resulted in an  gain reported in oil and gas revenues in our statement of operations for the year ended december  in october  we entered into a natural gas collar that covered  mmbtus per day for the period january  to december  at a floor of per mmbtu and a ceiling of per mmbtu 
this collar resulted in a loss from hedging activity of million reflected in oil and gas revenues in our statement of operations for the year ended december  in august  we entered into a fixed float index swap on  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period september  through december  and into a second fixed float index swap on an additional  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period september  through december  these two swap transactions resulted in a loss from hedging activity reflected in our statement of operations in oil and gas revenues of  in march  we purchased a floor on  mmbtus per day at per mmbtu for the period april  through june   at a cost of  the floor structure provided a minimum realized price for the protected volume yet preserved any upside in gas prices 
the natural gas floor expired with no additional cost to us 
tax matters at december   we have cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  including million of nols acquired in the miller merger that expire beginning through we currently anticipate that all of these nols will be utilized in connection with federal income taxes payable in the future 
nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs  have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provide a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and a floating interest rate of  a change in interest rate would result in an increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business we enter into hedging transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
during  due to the instability of prices and to achieve a more predictable cash flow  we put in place two natural gas collars for a portion of our production 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding hedges was approximately  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations hedging activities 
a change in the gas price per mmbtu  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price would cause the fair value total of the hedge to increase or decrease by approximately
