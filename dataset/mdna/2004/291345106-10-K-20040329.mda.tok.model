item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts general emisphere technologies  inc is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and in collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  osteoporosis  growth disorders  diabetes  asthma allergies  obesity and infectious diseases 
development and commercialization of these product candidates entails risk and significant expense 
since inception  we have had no product sales from these product candidates 
business overview we have developed and continue to enhance the human resource and physical infrastructure necessary to achieve our goal of becoming the premier oral drug delivery company 
we have a significant and growing patent estate to protect our discoveries  proprietary technologies and carrier library 
we continue to invest resources in research capabilities that 
improve our understanding of the mechanisms of action of the carriers in order to select the appropriate carriers to deliver the drug candidate in the most efficient manner  
redesign and update our computer modeling and in vitro testing capabilities to optimize carrier drug selection  
systematically study oral  buccal  transdermal  sublingual and topical approaches to drug delivery  
select animal models that best mimic the human response  and 
explore the formulation of drug and carrier to optimize delivery 
we utilize resources to  among other things  conduct feasibility studies to determine if an emisphere carrier can deliver a given drug 
a feasibility study is a pre clinical or clinical study with a duration of approximately six months 
we conduct feasibility studies when we believe that significant opportunities exist  or when requested by 
pharmaceutical companies who seek our assistance to deliver an injectable drug or less than optimally delivered drug via an emisphere carrier 
the costs of these studies typically are reimbursed 
from these feasibility studies  further collaborations may develop including larger clinical studies and partnerships 

government  universities and other biotech companies 
the costs of these studies may or may not be reimbursed 
as a result of our strategy  our partners lilly and novartis are  at their own expense  actively developing pth and sct  respectively  using emisphere carriers 
in  our primary focus was on developing oral insulin and heparin  which are self funded projects 
we also continue to conduct feasibility studies 
in  we completed a clinical trial for lilly related to rhgh  for which we were fully reimbursed 
in understanding the results of operations below  it is important to keep in mind that in and our primary focus was self developing liquid oral heparin in a large phase iii trial which was completed in early after the results of the phase iii trial were reported  we reduced our work force and infrastructure related to the trial 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenue was in  representing a decrease of  or compared to the year ended december  revenue for primarily related to research and development expense reimbursements under collaborative agreements with lilly 
the decrease primarily was attributable to the winding down of rhgh phase i clinical studies in collaboration with lilly 
costs associated with contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expenses 
total operating expenses were  for  a decrease of  or  compared to the year ended december  total operating expenses included restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment of  the total operating expenses for  excluding the restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment  were  a decrease of  or compared to the year ended december  the details of this decrease are outlined below 
the impact of the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin project and the subsequent restructuring and impairment charges are outlined in restructuring and loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets below 
research and development costs were  for  a decrease of  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease consisted of a  decrease in clinical trial expenses and a  decrease in all other research costs 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses primarily was due to i a  decrease in protect related clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trial and ii a  decrease in phase i proof of concept clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trials for rhgh  oral insulin  solid oral heparin  and cromolyn sodium 
the decrease in all other research costs of  consisted of i  in reduced compensation and related expenses  ii  in reduced lab clinical supplies costs  iii  in lower consulting and professional fees and iv  in lower operating costs 
overall  a majority of the decrease in other research costs was due to i the completion of the protect trial and ii the subsequent reduction in work force and closing of our connecticut research facility farmtech  both of which were initiated in the impact in of the closing of our farmtech operations was a  decrease in other research costs  which is included in the  total decrease in other research costs 
during  we did not incur any significant project costs related to the liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives other than certain close out expenses 
as a result  the liquid oral heparin project expense for excluding restructuring and impairment costs decreased by a total of  compared to the year ended december   consisting of a decrease of  in clinical trial expenses  in compensation and travel costs  in consulting  in lab clinical supplies   in production facility design work and in all other expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were  a decrease of  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease primarily was the result of a decrease of  in compensation and related expenses due to the elimination of the chief operating officer s position in  a decline in severance costs  lower headcount and lower relocation expenses 
the remaining decrease of primarily was related to the closing of our farmtech operations and the reduction of research and development support activity 
restructuring 
in  we announced a plan for restructuring our operations  which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives  and a reduction of associated infrastructure 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we evaluated several alternatives to consolidate our two research facilities located in tarrytown  new york and farmington  connecticut in order to eliminate excess capacity  reduce spending  and raise cash 
we decided to dispose of the farmington research facility 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we announced a reduction in force  which was implemented during may and june at the tarrytown facility and november and december at the farmington facility 
restructuring charges were adjusted by and in and  respectively  to reflect actual expenditures 
the reduction in force in included the termination of full time and temporary employees  including administrative personnel and scientists and research assistants 
four additional employees at the farmington research facility were terminated in we paid in stay bonuses to certain farmtech employees who were asked to remain at the facility for an extended period of time during the phase out of the facility 
the restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of the company s full time work force by approximately the following table presents the original restructuring accruals for tarrytown and farmington  the adjustments to these accruals  and the amounts paid through december  estimated restructuring restructuring actual reserve as of expenses disbursements adjustments december  severance and accrued vacation  outplacement services employee benefits contract exit costs other total   loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets 
we recorded asset impairments in and resulting from our decision to refocus operations and reduce costs and to surrender of our leased space in tarrytown  new york to the landlord and to lease some of the equipment in that space to the subsequent tenant see tarrytown facility transaction below 
management assessed the recoverability of certain intangible and fixed assets related to the oral liquid heparin program and the associated infrastructure 
a loss on impairment was recorded in of  an increase of or over the prior year  which includes an impairment charge of  related to furniture and equipment situated at the tarrytown facility 
the remaining  represents a write down of certain farmtech assets to fair value  which was assessed based on the age and condition of the equipment  potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
also in  we concluded that a total impairment was required with respect to the portion of the purchased technology representing patents related to the discontinued liquid oral heparin program 
we recorded an impairment charge of  comprised of  for purchased technology and for fixed assets which were to be used for the liquid oral heparin development program 
tarrytown facility transaction during  in order to streamline operations and reduce expenditures  we entered into a transaction to surrender to the landlord approximately of our leased space the surrendered space at the tarrytown facility 
the surrendered space primarily consists of office space  which was subsequently leased to another tenant the subsequent tenant at the tarrytown facility 
annual cost savings from the transaction are expected to be approximately  for the remainder of the lease term  which extends through august in the event that the subsequent tenant vacates the space before august   we are contingently liable for the rent payments and will be required to re let the space through august  completion of the lease amendment and related agreements took place in october the agreement describes four distinct areas to be surrendered  three of which were vacated and surrendered to the subsequent tenant as of december  the fourth space was vacated in march in connection with this transaction  we agreed to sell most of the furniture and equipment in the surrendered space to the subsequent tenant 
the subsequent tenant has agreed to make certain payments furniture payments which will be made directly to the landlord on a monthly basis 
a rental credit equal to the furniture payment will be applied against our rent payment to the landlord on a monthly basis 
total payments under the agreement are  and extend through august the transaction between emisphere and the subsequent tenant has been accounted for as an operating lease  with all furniture payments recorded as rental income 
we retain a security interest in the furniture and equipment until all required payments have been made 
we retained assets from the surrendered space with a net book value of for use elsewhere in the tarrytown facility 
we compared the net book value of the furniture and equipment to be leased to the fair value  which was determined to be the net present value of the furniture payments  or  and determined that the assets were impaired 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of  during the year ended december   which has been included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
the lease of these assets will result in a reduction of depreciation expense of    and in    and through  respectively 
farmington facility transaction in december  we entered into a contract of sale for the farmington facility with a real estate developer 
the purchaser s obligations to close on the facility are contingent on receiving certain governmental approvals  including but not limited to zoning approvals in final form  wetlands approvals and state environmental approvals  by august  in the event that the purchaser has not terminated the contract by august  because of the failure to obtain governmental approvals  the purchaser is obligated to close on the premises by the earlier date of the thirtieth day after receipt of governmental approvals or november  the purchaser does have the right to adjourn the closing date for six months after november  if governmental approvals have not been received and provided the purchaser shall pay the sum of per month to emisphere 
as of december   we performed an evaluation of the land  building and equipment available for sale at the farmington facility  which has a carrying value of  we evaluated the following two components of the facility i land  building and equipment that would most likely be transferred to the buyer when the sale is consummated such as equipment which is attached to the structure and expensive to remove  and ii equipment that is portable and available for sale and would most likely be retained by us 
we evaluated the land  building and attached equipment based on the sale price in the contract and determined that an impairment loss of the carrying value of the land  building and attached equipment had not been triggered as of december  in the event we are not successful in closing the sale of the farmington facility  we may need to write down the carrying value of the land  building and equipment further 
because the sale is conditioned in part on local town zoning approval  we cannot predict with certainty when  or if  the closing will take place 
subsequent to the decision to sell the farmington facility  we transferred equipment with a net book value of for use at the tarrytown facility and equipment with a net book value of was sold 
the remaining items of equipment were then evaluated for potential impairment 
the evaluations were based on the age and condition of the equipment  potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
based on this evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge of  during the year ended december   which has been included in loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
the land  building  and equipment at the farmington facility that are available for sale are included at their carrying value in land  building and equipment held for sale  net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december  the of equipment transferred out of the farmington facility is included in equipment and leasehold improvements  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
purchased technology impairment at december   we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining purchased technology related to the solid forms of oral heparin 
we are proceeding with planned studies related to this formulation and we estimate that future undiscounted cash flows from programs related to the solid form of oral heparin are still valid 
therefore  an impairment of the remaining purchased technology has not been triggered as of december  the net carrying value of the remaining purchased technology is  a negative outcome in the development of solid oral heparin may trigger a write down of related patents  currently valued at  in the future 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology is for each of the next five years 
depreciation and amortization costs were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of depreciation expense related to the farmington research facility  which was classified as held for sale as of december  and therefore was not depreciated during  offset by increases in depreciation for assets put into service at the tarrytown facility in overall  our operating loss was  including the restructuring and impairment charges in the year ended december   a decrease of  as compared to a  operating loss for the year ended december  excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charges the operating loss was  in the year ended december  or a decrease of  compared to other expense and income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  as compared to the change is primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of  plus an increase in interest expense of related to the note due to elan 
see liquidity and capital resources for further information concerning the elan note 
the decrease in investment income resulted from lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of  including restructuring and impairment charges  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
excluding the restructuring and impairment charges the net loss was  in the year ended december   a decrease of  or compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract research revenue was  in  representing a decrease of  or compared to the year ended december  revenue for related to research and development expense reimbursement primarily under collaboration agreements with lilly  cubist  and regeneron 
the decrease primarily was attributable to i the winding down of certain phase i clinical studies in collaboration with lilly decrease  and ii the near completion of our screening phase research  primarily related to our efforts on behalf of cubist  regeneron  and other parties decrease 
costs associated with contract research revenue approximate such revenue and are included in research and development expenses 
total operating expenses were  for  an increase of  or  compared to the year ended december  total operating expenses included restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment of  total operating expenses for  excluding the restructuring costs and loss on asset impairment  was  an increase of  or over the year ended december  research and development costs were  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to the year ended december  the decrease consisted of a  decrease in clinical trial expenses  partially offset by a  increase in other research costs 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses primarily was due to a  decrease in protect related clinical trial expenses resulting from the completion of the trial  partially offset by a  increase in phase i proof of concept clinical expenses  primarily for solid oral heparin  oral insulin and rhgh 
the  increase in other research cost consisted of i increased compensation expense of  due to increased headcount that was partially related to the first full year of the operations at farmtech  ii one time production plant design expenses of for the oral liquid heparin delivery agent  iii increased lease and utility costs of  and iv an increase of  in consulting expenses 
these increased expenses were offset by a decrease in overall research and development expenses resulting from the restructuring announced in may of overall the liquid oral heparin project expense for  excluding restructuring and impairment costs  was  consisting of  in clinical trial expenses  in consulting   in clinical supplies  in production facility design work and  in all other expenses 
these program costs did not recur in because of the discontinuation of the liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives 
general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of  or  compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of in bonus payouts  in increased compensation expense  in relocation expenses  in recruiting expense  primarily associated with the addition of a chief operating officer  and in overall occupancy and utility fees 
these increased expenses were partially offset by a reduction in legal and professional fees and other expenses 
restructuring 
as noted above  on may   we announced a plan for restructuring our operations  which included the discontinuation of our liquid oral heparin program and related initiatives  and a reduction of associated infrastructure 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we evaluated several alternatives to consolidate our two research facilities located in tarrytown  new york and farmington  connecticut in order to eliminate excess capacity  reduce spending  and raise cash 
we decided to dispose of the farmington research facility 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we announced a reduction in force  which was implemented during may and june at the tarrytown facility and november and december at the farmington facility 
the restructuring plan resulted in the reduction of our full time work force by approximately 
the following table presents the original restructuring accruals for tarrytown and farmington  the adjustments to these accruals  and the amounts paid through december  estimated restructuring restructuring actual reserve as of expenses disbursements adjustments december  severance and accrued vacation  outplacement services employee benefits contract exit costs other total   in addition  we forgave loans to certain terminated employees and recognized compensation expense of the reserve is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of december loss on impairment of intangible and fixed assets 
in connection with the results of the liquid oral heparin clinical trials  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of certain intangible and fixed assets related to that program and related initiatives 
we concluded that a total impairment of the portion of the purchased technology representing patents related to the liquid form of oral heparin was required because we do not anticipate realization of the carrying value of this asset 
we recorded a  impairment charge 
in addition  we determined that an impairment had occurred with respect to a reactor and associated accessories  which was to be used only for manufacture of oral liquid heparin  and a gene chip array system and related accessories 
during the year  we recorded a impairment charge  representing the reduction of the carrying value of the reactor and gene chip array system and associated accessories to their fair value  based on the sale of the equipment to third parties 
in connection with the decision to dispose of the farmington facility  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of land  building and equipment at the facility 
the evaluation was based on the weighted average probability of estimated undiscounted future cash flows from five expressions of interest from third parties 
based on this evaluation  an impairment loss of the carrying value of the land  building and equipment had not been triggered as of december  the carrying value of land  building  and equipment as of december  was  in the event that we are not successful in closing on the sale of the farmington facility  we may need to write down the carrying value of the land  building and equipment further 
depreciation and amortization expenses were  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  as compared to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of depreciation expense related to the farmington research facility  which was acquired in april  along with amortization expense for leasehold improvements related to additional laboratory and office space placed into service at the tarrytown facility in overall  our operating loss was  including the restructuring and impairment charges  for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to a  operating loss for the year ended december  excluding the restructuring and asset impairment charges  the operating loss was  in the year ended december   an increase of  compared to other expense and income was  of expense for the year ended december  as compared to  of income for the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of  plus an increase in interest expense of related to the note due to elan 
the decrease in investment income resulted from a reduction in cash and investment balances and prevailing interest rates 
we also recorded a other than temporary impairment charge to write down to fair value our investment in the preferred stock of a biotech company with products that could potentially use our oral delivery technology 
we considered the following factors to be primary indicators of impairment i the biotech company s need to raise sufficient capital to ensure funding of its research and development projects  ii the biotech company s inability to meet payment obligations as they become due and iii the possibility that the biotech company may not be able to continue as a going concern unless additional financing is obtained 
fair value was estimated based on the price of the biotech company s publicly traded common stock 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of  including restructuring and impairment charges for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
excluding the restructuring and impairment charges  the net loss was  in the year ended december   an increase of  or compared to liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling  a decrease of  compared to december  net cash used in operations was  in  as compared to  in the year ended december   a decrease of  resulting from the restructuring efforts initiated during the second half of capital expenditures were  in compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to the termination of most capital projects following the restructuring described above 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to  during the year ended december   a decrease of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options decreased by from  due to lower prices of our common stock and fewer employee exercises 
this decrease was partially offset by the proceeds from a financing lease of since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
on december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
we expect our cash  cash equivalent and investment balances to decrease by approximately  in absent additional financing  new collaborations  milestone payments and or closing of the sale of the farmington facility  we would expect to end with approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
reduced cash expenditures as a result of the surrender of a portion of the leased premises at the tarrytown facility and closing on the sale of the farmington facility  should it occur  will be partially offset by higher costs due to inflation and increases in employee compensation 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to in capital purchases may be financed by lease arrangements 
this projection of cash usage and year end cash  cash equivalent and investment balances assumes that during  we will not i enter into a partnership agreement for oral insulin  solid oral heparin or any other non partnered program  ii receive any milestone payments on currently partnered programs  or iii close on the sale of the farmington facility 
we have enough funds to continue our development programs  as presented to the board of directors  beyond we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue operations and if we fail to generate sufficient revenue  raise additional funds or undergo further restructuring  the resultant reduction of our available cash resources would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are successful in securing a partner for either oral insulin or solid oral heparin  we may receive milestone payments  upfront fees  expense reimbursements and or cash infusions 
such cash inflows could delay our need to raise additional funds to maintain operations beyond in the event that we are unable to achieve long term profitability and or obtain additional capital  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases 
our bylaws provide for the indemnification of officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under the bylaws is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance policies that  in most cases  would limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage  the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal 
all of these indemnification provisions were grandfathered under the provisions of fin as they were in effect prior to december  accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which  in our judgment  are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector 
these agreements are typically with business partners  clinical sites  and suppliers 
pursuant to these agreements  we generally agree to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates  use of such product candidates  or other actions taken or omitted by emisphere 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the normal course of business  we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims  environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies 
we consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if  in our opinion  we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we  after consultation with legal counsel  do not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims  including the pending litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
significant contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amount due in total less than more than obligation year to years to years years type of obligation long term debt   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     clinical research organizations total     in july  we acquired from elan our ownership interest in ebbisham a jointly owned entity created by the company and elan  in exchange for a seven year   zero coupon note due july carrying a interest rate  compounding semi annually the note  plus royalties on oral heparin product sales  subject to an annual maximum and certain milestone payments 
in connection with any payment on the note made by the emisphere  we have the right to require elan to purchase our common stock at the market price at an aggregate price equal to such payment made  subject to the following conditions i the acceptance by the fda of a new drug application from emisphere involving any heparin product  ii our closing stock price remaining at or above per share for the consecutive trading days prior to the date we exercise this right and iii the exercise of this right would not require the application of the equity accounting method by elan 
at december   the balance on the elan note was  the operating lease is related to the tarrytown facility 
under the terms of the agreement with the landlord to surrender a portion of this space in  we are contingently liable for the rent payments and will be required to re let the space through august  if the subsequent tenant vacates the surrendered space before august  we have excluded such payments from the above table because we believe that the possibility of such an event occurring is remote 
in the event that the subsequent tenant vacates the space  the maximum amount which we would be obligated to pay would be   in less than one year   in one to three years and in four to five years for rent  real estate taxes and operating expenses 
we are obligated to make payments under certain contracts with third parties who provide clinical research services to support our ongoing research and development 
research and development costs we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf self funded and in collaborations with corporate partners partnered 
generally  research and development expenditures are allocated to specific research projects 
due to various uncertainties and risks  including those described in risk factors below  relating to the progress of our product candidates through development stages  clinical trials  regulatory approval  commercialization and market acceptance  it is not possible to accurately predict future spending or time to completion by project or project category 
the following table summarizes research and development spending to date by project category year ended december  cumulative spending to date research     feasibility projects self funded    partnered  development projects oral heparin self funded     oral insulin self funded     partnered    all other self funded other     total all projects     cumulative spending from august  through december  research is classified as resources expended to expand the ability to create new carriers  to ascertain the mechanisms of action of carriers  and to establish computer based modeling capabilities  prototype formulations  animal models  and in vitro testing capabilities 
during the year ended december   of research and development expenses  related to certain projects  was reclassified as restructuring for severance charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states involves the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
certain of these estimates and assumptions are considered to be critical accounting policies  due to their complexity  subjectivity  and uncertainty  along with their relevance to our financial performance 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
these policies and their key characteristics are outlined below 
investments 
we invest excess cash in accordance with a policy objective seeking to preserve both liquidity and safety of principal 
we consider all highly liquid  interest bearing debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents may include demand deposits held in banks and interest bearing money market funds 
investments are carried at fair value and are considered to be available for sale 
accordingly  unrealized holding gains and losses are reported in stockholders equity 
we generally invest our excess funds in obligations of the us government and its agencies  bank deposits  mortgage backed securities  and investment grade debt securities issued by corporations and financial institutions at ratings of a or a standard and poor s 
although our investments carry high ratings when purchased  a lowering of the rating of the corporate debt securities in our portfolio could result in an impairment 
purchased technology 
purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents underlying research and development projects of ebbisham ltd  related to oral heparin  that were commenced but not yet completed as of the date of our acquisition of full ownership and which  if unsuccessful  have no alternative future use 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the fair value of purchased technology is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
at december   purchased technology had a carrying value of  net of amortization 
we amortize purchased technology on a straight line basis over a period of years  the average life of the related patents 
estimated amortization expense for the purchased technology is for each of the next five fiscal years 
equipment and leasehold improvements 
equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided for on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or of the improvements whichever is shorter 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we recognized impairments on long lived assets of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these impairments were based on estimates of future cash flows  including potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which would result in additional impairment losses or losses on disposal of the assets 
clinical trial accrual methodology 
clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we account for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrollment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded in accordance with the following methodology i the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  which are impacted by any change in the number of sites  number of patients and patient start dates  ii direct service costs  which are primarily on going monitoring costs  are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  and iii principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  and financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
sab superseded staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab in december contract research revenue includes revenue from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies and is comprised of reimbursed research and development costs  as well as upfront and research and development milestone payments 
deferred revenue represents payments received which are related to future performance 
non refundable upfront and research and development milestone payments and payments for services are recognized as revenue as the related services are performed over the term of the collaboration 
revenue recognized is the lower of i the percentage complete  measured by incurred costs  applied to expected contractual payments or ii the total non refundable cash received to date 
with regards to revenue from non refundable fees  changes in assumptions of estimated costs to complete could have a material impact on the revenue recognized 
contract research revenue is expected to fluctuate from year to year and is dependent upon the timing of work plans mutually agreed to with collaborators and to the allocation of efforts between us and our collaborators 
future impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than on the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan and establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of eitf shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf prior to sfas s initial application 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued sab  which supercedes sab sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab adoption of sab was required immediately and did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin r  which was issued in january fin r clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of fin r a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
fin r deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies  to the end of the first reporting period ending after march   except that all public companies must at a minimum apply the provisions of the interpretation to entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under the fasb literature prior to the issuance of fin r by the end of the first reporting period ending after december  adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
sfas requires issuers to classify as liabilities the following three types of freestanding financial instruments mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares by transferring assets  and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares 
sfas defines a freestanding financial instrument as a financial instrument that is entered into separately and apart from any of the entity s other financial instruments or equity transactions or is entered into in conjunction with some other transaction and can be legally detached and exercised on a separate basis 
for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   sfas is effective immediately 
for all other instruments of public companies  sfas went into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board deferred the effective date for selected provisions of sfas  limited to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
the deferral of those selected provisions is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
on november   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the disclosure and recognition provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
transactions with related parties the company was introduced to the purchaser of the farmington facility by rob beyer  the son in law of howard pack  a director of the company 
the company is unaware as to the nature of mr 
beyer s interest in the transaction  if this transaction is successfully completed 
however  neither mr 
beyer nor mr 
pack will receive any fee from emisphere 
this relationship was disclosed to the board of directors at the time that this contract was presented to the board for approval  and mr 
pack abstained from the related discussion and vote 
the sale price in the sale contract is higher than any other offer that was received 
during  two former members of the board of directors resigned their board positions and have become consultants to emisphere 
risk factors the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements that we make in this report and elsewhere including oral statements from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  our operating results  our financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
we are highly dependent on the clinical success of our oral insulin and oral heparin product candidates 
oral insulin insulin is currently available in injectable form for type and type diabetic patients 
we believe that an oral form of insulin would gain significant market share and have therefore focused significant resources on developing oral insulin 
we intend to secure a partner to fund further development of this product candidate 
we are aware that other companies currently are developing spray buccal or aerosol pulmonary forms eg aventis pfizer nektar s exubera of insulin  and that insulin delivery is a highly competitive area 
our product candidate has demonstrated favorable data in early patient studies in both type and type diabetics and we believe that oral insulin has the potential to be an improved therapy for diabetics 
however  we cannot assure you that these data  or future data will demonstrate that our oral form of insulin will be better than existing therapy nor can we assure you that we will secure a partner to develop this product candidate 
in  we announced that we achieved a near term milestone as a result of late stage negotiations with an unnamed partner regarding an oral insulin partnership 
in march  those negotiations terminated without an agreement being reached 
we intend to continue to fund any clinical trials and further development of our oral insulin product candidate until we secure a partner  and we will continue to seek a partner for this product candidate to conduct later stage development and fund commercialization efforts 
oral heparin heparin currently is not available in oral form 
we believe that an oral form of heparin would gain significant market share and therefore have focused significant resources on developing oral heparin 
other companies are currently developing spray buccal or alternate forms of heparin  and other forms of heparin have recently received european approval eg astrazeneca s exanta 
heparin delivery is a highly competitive area 
we are developing solid dosage forms of oral heparin and have commenced phase i testing 
we earlier attempted to develop a liquid form of oral heparin 
we commenced phase iii clinical trials protect for this solution form of product in and began dosing patients in january the trial was completed in early and did not meet its endpoint of superiority to lovenox 
all further development of liquid oral heparin was terminated 
we cannot assure you that future data related to solid oral heparin will demonstrate superiority  equivalence  or non inferiority of solid oral heparin to alternative heparin forms 
in july  we reacquired all product  marketing and technology rights for our heparin products from elan  which had been our joint venture partner since in accordance with the termination agreement with elan  we will be required to pay elan royalties on emisphere sales of oral heparin  subject to an annual cap 
unless we enter into a new partnership agreement related to oral heparin  we will continue to fund clinical trials and further development activities related to this product candidate 
in addition  the manufacture  marketing and distribution of pharmaceuticals is a formidable undertaking 
our competitors may have more resources and or experience in bringing their product candidates to market 
we are dependent upon collaborative partners to develop and commercialize compounds using our delivery agents 
a key part of our strategy is to form collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing  testing  obtaining government approval for and commercializing oral forms of therapeutic compounds using the eligen tm technology 
we currently have collaboration agreements with novartis  lilly  and regeneron 
we cannot assure you that 
we will be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements to develop products utilizing our drug delivery technology  
any existing or future collaborative arrangements will be sustainable or successful  
the product candidates in collaborative arrangements will be further developed by partners in a timely fashion  
any collaborative partner will not infringe upon our intellectual property position  or 
milestones in collaborative agreements will be met and milestone payments will be received 
if we are unable to obtain development assistance and funds from other pharmaceutical companies to fund a portion of our product development costs and to commercialize our product candidates  we may have to delay  scale back or curtail one or more of our projects 
thus we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage 
our product candidates are in various stages of development  and we cannot be certain that any will be suitable for commercial purposes 
to be profitable  we must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our products under development  or secure a partner to provide financial and other assistance with these steps 
the time necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product is long and uncertain 
before we or a potential partner can sell any of our products under development  we must demonstrate through preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials that each product is safe and effective for human use for each targeted indication 
we cannot be certain that we or our current or future partners will be able to begin  or continue  planned clinical trials for our product candidates  or if we are able  that the product candidates will prove to be safe and will produce their intended effects 
a number of companies in the drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after showing promising results in earlier studies or trials 
we cannot assure you that favorable results in any preclinical study or early clinical trial will mean that favorable results will ultimately be obtained in future clinical trials 
nor can we assure you that results of limited animal and human studies are indicative of results that would be achieved in future animal studies or human clinical studies  all or some of which will be required in order to have our product candidates obtain regulatory approval 
similarly  we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be approved by the fda 
our future business success depends heavily upon regulatory approvals  which can be difficult to obtain for a variety of reasons  including cost 
our preclinical studies and clinical trials  as well as the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates  are subject to extensive  costly and rigorous regulation by various governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the process of obtaining required approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities often takes many years  is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we  either independently or in collaboration with others  will meet the applicable regulatory criteria in order to receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining united states or foreign approvals for our self developed projects could result in substantial additional costs to us  and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies 
additionally  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals encountered by others with whom the company collaborates also could adversely affect our business and prospects 
even if regulatory approval of a product is obtained  the approval may place limitations on the intended uses of the product  and may restrict the way in which we or our partner may market the product 
our current and future prospects could be affected by competitive news 
if a competitor announces i a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or ii an approval by a regulatory agency of the marketing of a competitive product  such announcement may have a material adverse effect on our operations or future prospects  the price of our common stock  or our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our products 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and are likely to require additional capital 
since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
on december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
we expect to continue to incur clinical development expenses for self funded programs and for programs for which we are attempting to secure a partner 
we expect no further significant liquid oral heparin solution clinical development expenses as the program was discontinued in may we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to continue operations through the end of and for a period of time beyond without raising additional capital 
however  this expectation is based on the current operating plan that could change as a result of many factors  and we may require additional funding sooner than anticipated 
to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our products or reduce spending 
the ability to raise funds in the future may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our outstanding debt to elan  in the form of a zero coupon note with a interest rate  compounded semi annually  matures on july  we may not have sufficient capital or the ability to raise capital to repay the note at its time of maturity 
actual savings and improvements in operations from current restructurings may be lower than expected 
the obligation of the proposed buyer of the farmington facility to consummate the purchase is contingent on receiving certain governmental approvals 
we can not assure when or if the sale to this particular buyer will be consummated 
the closing of the sale of the farmington facility may not occur in the near future and the costs associated with the facility eg  utilities  insurance  maintenance  lawn care and real estate taxes may require cash outlays 
if the sale of the facility to the proposed buyer is not consummated  we may sell the facility for less than the current contract price and may be required to record an impairment charge 
if we cannot adequately protect our patent and proprietary rights  our business will suffer 
although we have patents for some of our product candidates and have applied for additional patents  there can be no assurance that patents applied for will be granted  that patents granted to or acquired by us now or in the future will be valid and enforceable and provide us with meaningful protection from competition or that we will possess the financial resources necessary to enforce any of our patents 
also  we cannot assure that any products that we or a licensee develop will not infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we maintain a policy of requiring employees  scientific advisors  consultants and collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
part of our strategy involves collaborative arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies for the development of new formulations of drugs developed by others and  ultimately  the receipt of royalties on sales of the new formulations of those drugs 
these drugs are generally the property of the pharmaceutical companies and may be the subject of patents or patent applications and other rights of protection owned by the pharmaceutical companies 
to the extent those patents or other forms of rights expire  become invalid or otherwise ineffective  or to the extent those drugs are covered by patents or other forms of protection owned by third parties  sales of those drugs by the collaborating pharmaceutical company may be restricted  limited  enjoined  or may cease 
accordingly  the potential for royalty revenues to us may be adversely affected 
we may be at risk of having to obtain a license from third parties making proprietary improvements to our technology 
there is a risk that third parties may make improvements or innovations to our technology in a more expeditious manner than emisphere 
should such circumstances arise  we may need to obtain a license from such third party to obtain the benefit of the improvement or innovation 
royalties payable under such a license would reduce our share of total revenue 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and in some cases  test our products 
as of  we have a gmp compliant facility to manufacture a limited number of clinical supplies related to emisphere delivery agents 
currently  we have no manufacturing facilities for large scale clinical or commercial production of any compounds under consideration as products 
we have no research facilities for later stage product candidate testing prior to first human testing 
the success of our partnerships is dependent on the proposed or current partner s capacity and ability to adequately manufacture drug products to meet the proposed demand of each respective market 
we may face product liability claims related to participation in clinical trials or the use or misuse of any future products 
we have product liability insurance with a policy limit of million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
the testing  manufacture and marketing of products for humans utilizing our drug delivery technology may expose us to potential product liability and other claims 
these may be claims directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products that may be developed in the future 
we seek to structure development programs with pharmaceutical companies that would complete the development  manufacturing and marketing of the finished product in a manner that would protect us from such liability  but the indemnity undertakings for product liability claims that we secure from the pharmaceutical companies may prove to be insufficient 
our operations may involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental  health and safety taxes and regulations 
we may incur substantial liability arising from our activities involving the use of hazardous materials 
as a biopharmaceutical research and development company  we are subject to various local  state and federal environmental  health and safety regulations and laws involving the use of hazardous material 
our operations involve the controlled use of chemicals  biologicals and radioactive materials 
the cost of compliance with these various regulations has the potential to be quite substantial 
should we be held liable or face regulatory actions regarding an accident involving personal injury or an environmental release  we potentially could exceed our resources or insurance coverage 
we face rapid technological change and intense competition 
our success depends  in part  upon maintaining a competitive position in the development of products and technologies in an evolving field in which developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace 
we compete with other drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  research organizations  individual scientists and non profit organizations engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery technologies or new drug research and testing  as well as with entities developing new drugs that may be orally active 
many of these competitors have greater research and development capabilities  experience  and marketing  financial and managerial resources than we have  and  therefore  represent significant competition 
our products  when developed and marketed  may compete with existing injectable versions of the same drug  some of which are well established in the marketplace and manufactured by formidable competitors  as well as other existing drugs 
for example  our oral heparin product candidate  if successful  would compete with injectable heparin  injectable low molecular weight heparin and warfarin  an oral anti coagulant  as well as the recently approved oral pentasaccharide and oral melagatran products 
these products are marketed throughout the world by world renowned leading pharmaceutical companies such as aventis pharma sa  pfizer  inc and bristol myers squibb company 
similarly  our salmon calcitonin product candidate  if developed and marketed  would compete with a wide array of existing osteoporosis therapies  including a nasal dosage form of salmon calcitonin  estrogen replacement therapy  bisphosphonates and selective receptor modulators  or  potentially oral forms of these drugs 
our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies or obtaining government approval for products before we do 
developments by others may render our product candidates  or the therapeutic compounds used in combination with our product candidates  noncompetitive or obsolete 
for example  astrazeneca plc has received us and european approval of a pro drug form of melagantran  a direct thrombin inhibitor  which would compete with our oral heparin products 
similarly  nobex corporation has an oral insulin formulation being developed and that at least one competitor has notified the fda that it is developing a competing formulation of salmon calcitonin 
we cannot assure you that  if our products are marketed  they will be preferred to existing drugs or that they will be preferred to or available before other products in development 
for a more detailed discussion of known competitors and competing products candidates and technologies  see the discussion under the heading item business competition 
we are dependent on our key personnel and if we cannot recruit and retain leaders in our research  development  manufacturing  and commercial organizations  our business will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on our executive officers 
if we are not able to retain any of these persons our business may suffer 
there is intense competition in the biotechnology industry for qualified scientists and managerial personnel in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of drugs 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
anti takeover provisions of our corporate charter documents  delaware law and our agreements with collaborators may affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
of these  shares   are currently designated series a junior participating cumulative preferred stock in connection with our stockholders rights plan  and the remaining  shares remain available for future issuance 
rights of holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
additional provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
these include provisions that classify our board of directors  limit the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent  call special meetings  remove a director for cause  amend the by laws or approve a merger with another company 
we also have a stockholder s right s plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill  that makes it difficult  if not impossible  for a person to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  either alone or together with affiliates and associates  owns or within the past three years  did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
the trading price for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market prices for securities of drug delivery  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile 
factors that could adversely affect our stock price include 
fluctuations in our operating results  
announcements of partnerships or technological collaborations  innovations or new products by us or our competitors  
governmental regulation  
developments in patent or other proprietary rights  
public concern as to the safety of drugs developed by us or others  
the results of preclinical testing and clinical studies or trials by us  our partners or our competitors  
litigation  
general stock market and economic conditions  
number of shares available for trading float  
inclusion in or dropping from stock indexes 
future sales of common stock  or the prospect of future sales  may depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase up to  shares of common stock which are currently exercisable and additional options to purchase up to  shares of common stock are exercisable over the next several years 
in addition  an aggregate of  shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under our directors deferred compensation plan  of which  shares are available for future grants 
the holders of these options or rights have an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock with a resulting dilution in the interests of the other 
the existence of these options or rights may adversely affect the terms on which the company may be able to obtain additional financing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
our investments consist of us treasuries  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our investments totaled  at december  of this total   had fixed interest rates  of which  were short term and  were long term investments  and  had variable interest rates  all of which were long term investments 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments maturities in less than one year  we do not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
the value of our fixed interest rate long term investments is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair value of these investments due to differences between the current market interest rate and the rate prevailing at the date of original purchase of the investment 
reasonably expected changes in prevailing interest rates would not materially impact the value of our long term investments
