the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of printing systems and consumable supplies that personalize plastic identification cards by printing images and text onto the card 
our printing systems are capable of encoding data onto cards that incorporate bar code  magnetic stripe  smart card or proximity card technology 
we believe that our engineering expertise and our ability to offer a broad range of printing systems using multiple printing technologies have led to a reputation for innovation in our industry 
we believe that we are the only manufacturer in our industry to offer three distinct technologies in printing systems high definition printing reverse image  traditional direct to card printing dye sublimation and cardjet printing technology inkjet to personalize plastic identification cards  complete with digital images and text  lamination and electronically encoded information 
we believe there are between and companies manufacturing digital card printers 
the great majority of these are offering direct to card dye sublimation printers 
we believe our high definition printing platform currently has two competitors and we are not aware of any other company offering an inkjet solution for printing plastic identification cards 
concern for personal safety and property protection has led to the need for electronic and visual identification and access control 
we believe the demand for our products will increase as governments and corporations worldwide address their security needs 
we believe the development and implementation of new technologies that add security features to plastic cards should foster a growing market for our systems 
we market and sell our products exclusively through a distribution channel of independent distributors and resellers in more than countries worldwide 
we estimate that as of december   we have manufactured and sold more than  of our printing systems 
end users of our printing systems create personalized cards for a wide variety of applications including corporate security and access  drivers licenses  government and military identification  student identification and access  public transportation access  and recreation and gaming 
we sell both printing systems and consumable supplies used in those systems 
we produce a diverse array of card printing systems that allow us the meet the needs of end users  ranging from those who desire a premium system to address complex applications to those focused on lower priced systems with fewer features 
we also sell consumable supplies that are used with our systems  including dye sublimation ribbons  overlaminates  thermal resin ribbons  printheads  inkjet cartridges  inkjet card cartridges and blank cards 
over the past five years the proportion of our total revenues provided by consumable supplies has increased to of total revenues in from in factors affecting our net sales of card printing systems each year include the mix of systems sold  declines in average selling price and the number of major projects we are successful in winning 
as the number of fargo systems installed and in use continues to grow  the sale of consumable supplies for use in these systems provides us with a significant recurring  and growing revenue stream 
our markets can be categorized in three broad tiers entry level  mid level and high level 
we have historically been successful in each of these markets 
end users in the entry level market are typically using a simple photo identification card 
users in this market are likely more focused on lower priced systems with fewer features 
users in the mid level tier typically would add functionality such as access control or time and attendance recording features 
at the high end of our markets are government and government related projects and corporate security programs with multi level requirements  which typically will use a much more sophisticated and complex identification card and are projects where the end user is looking for the highest levels of functionality and security 
examples of government and government related projects include national identification programs  military programs and drivers license programs 
these projects typically span multiple years and involve integrating solutions into complex existing infrastructures 
the printer component of these projects is typically only a small piece of the overall project 
while the company actively pursues such project business  these projects are very competitive and it is very difficult to predict the timing of the bid process  funding and implementation of any such projects 
we did not obtain any significant new major government project business in we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in net sales and gross profit as a result of a number of factors  including  among other things  the timing and extent of promotional pricing  the timing of major projects  the number and mix of products sold in the quarter  the availability and cost of components and materials  costs  benefits and timing of new product introductions  customer order size and shipment timing  and seasonable factors affecting timing of purchase orders 
in october  we introduced a new distribution program for our united states channel partners 
the new program categorizes distribution partners into four complementary  yet separate  program tracks 
fargo solution providers provide retail customers with sales  service and integration expertise on fargo s full line of professional and persona series products and systems 
fargo value added distributors provide in depth integration expertise and support for fargo solution providers and end user customers on fargo s full line of products and systems 
fargo distributors provide product distribution services to fargo solution providers and persona series resellers 
fargo manufacturing resellers are companies that have a core business of developing and manufacturing products where the sale of identification card printers is a secondary portion of its sale 
each category has the option to work exclusively with fargo to develop market share and expertise in the markets they serve 
the program continues our two product line strategy with restricted distribution on our professional series products and broad distribution of our persona products 
the new program resulted from a review of our existing and future channel requirements  our partners needs and the products that are under development by us 
we believe that this new distribution structure will be attractive to both current and new distribution partners 
however  it is currently too early to assess the results of the changes or their potential impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative terminated acquisition costs total operating expenses operating income comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales decreased to million in from million in sales of equipment decreased to million from million in  and sales of supplies increased to million from million in the decrease in sales of equipment is mainly due to a decrease in shipments related to major government projects and a decrease in average selling price  partially offset by an increase in unit volume from non project business 
the increase in sales of supplies was primarily due to changes in sales mix as well as price increases in the increase is also due to an increase in sales of supplies for projects 
international sales increased to million in from million in and accounted for of net sales in compared to of net sales in the dollar increase in international sales was principally attributable to increased sales of supplies in canada  mexico  south america  australia and the middle east in  which is partially offset by a decrease in sales of equipment in canada and australia

we also experienced higher payroll and benefits expenses in selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to higher general and administrative expenses  due mainly to higher legal and professional fees  directors fees  and health insurance costs  partially offset by a decrease in advertising marketing expenses 
the increase in legal and professional fees relates primarily to litigation expenses incurred to enforce our patents in asia 
directors fees increased due to the addition of three board members in the increase in our health insurance is due mainly to the increase in our major claims experience in the fourth quarter of the decrease in advertising marketing expenses is due to the timing of new product introductions

comparison of years ended december  and net sales 
net sales increased to million in from million in sales of equipment increased to million from million in  and sales of supplies increased to million from million in in  we experienced an increase in our base printer business and project equipment sales over the same period of the increase in shipments of equipment is also due to successful new product launches 
the increase in sales of supplies was mainly the result of increased supplies volume sold in from an increase in project sales 
international sales increased to million in from million in and accounted for of net sales in and the dollar increase in international sales was principally attributable to increased sales of equipment and supplies in europe and australia in  which is partially offset by a decrease in sales in south america 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million for from million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for compared to in gross profit for was positively impacted by reductions in material costs  increased printer volumes  sales mix  and lower manufacturing costs associated with quality issues 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for compared to for the increase is primarily due to higher salary expense as a result of higher staffing levels 
in  research and development expenses are net of approximately  charged by us to a third party for certain engineering development work 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in increased advertising  tradeshow  business and health insurance and salary expenses were partially offset by lower professional fees 
we experienced higher professional fees in due to fees paid to outside consultants to improve our manufacturing processes 
the increase in salary expense is mainly due to higher staffing levels in our sales and marketing departments 
terminated acquisition costs 
in connection with our proposed acquisition by another company  which was terminated in march  we incurred legal  professional  and investment banking expenses of  in  compared to million in operating income 
operating income increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  operating income was in as compared to in interest expense 
interest expense totaled  in compared to million in the reduction in our outstanding debt combined with reduced interest rates led to the lower interest expense 
the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt for the year ended december  was as compared to in income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in  which results in an effective tax rate of  compared to income tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of in the decrease in the effective tax rate for relates to research and experimentation credits we utilized during liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations  debt service and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations 
working capital was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
during  we repaid million of bank debt and in  we paid off another million 
at december  and throughout  we had no bank debt outstanding 
we believe  based on our current cash levels as well as the operating cash flows expected in and the funds available to us under our million revolving credit facility  that we will have sufficient funds to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   an increase of million from million at december  this increase is due to positive net cash flows provided by our operating activities and to the company being debt free in  which resulted in a decrease in interest expense from of  cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million primarily for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
the decrease in accounts receivable of million also contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due mainly to the timing of sales and customers taking advantage of early payment discounts 
these cash flows were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts payable is mainly due to the timing of purchases and decreased revenue activity in the fourth quarter of  compared to cash used by investing activities was million exclusively for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the purchase of equipment is largely dependent on the timing of new products 
cash provided by financing activities was  due to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million primarily for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million also contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is mainly due to the timing of purchases and increased revenue activity in the fourth quarter of these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily related to the timing of sales 
cash used by investing activities was million exclusively for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash used in financing activities was million primarily due to payments on our credit facility  partially offset by million in net proceeds received from our secondary public offering 
in december  we further amended our credit facility  which under the terms of the amendment  was converted to a million revolving credit facility  of which there was no outstanding balance at december  or at any point during the borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined by the agreement 
under the terms of the amended agreement  we may borrow at the prime rate of interest or libor plus a margin of 
interest is payable within to days  as defined by the agreement 
the credit agreement is in effect through december the credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of specified financial ratios including fixed charge coverage and total debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement  and restrictions on capital expenditures  payment of dividends and operating lease expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total operating lease 
we lease our office  warehouse and manufacturing space under an operating lease that expires in december total rent expense for this operating lease was   and  during  and  respectively 
purchase obligations 
purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
of this amount   relates to unconditional purchase agreements that the company has entered into with certain suppliers 
these agreements are reviewed on a semi annual basis  and  unless terminated by either party  automatically renew for an additional six month period 
the agreements may be terminated by either party with a day written notice 
purchase obligations also include an agreement to purchase million a year of materials under a ten year agreement with one of our suppliers 
our obligation to meet this commitment is conditional upon the supplier continuing to meet a number of obligations set out in the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based upon the information available to us  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when title passes  which generally is at the time of shipment 
we provide for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns in the period revenue is recognized 
certain of our customers have arrangements that include stock balancing return provisions 
we provide an allowance for stock balancing based on estimated expected returns 
sales to these customers collectively represented  and  respectively  of net sales for the years ended december   and under the terms of the stock balancing agreements  we estimate that the maximum amount of returns is approximately  at december   of which we have recorded an allowance of  for stock balancing estimated returns 
this reserve is included in our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  analysis of stock balancing agreements and specific information obtained by us on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of our customers 
if the financing conditions of our customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of our customers to make payments on their accounts  we may be required to increase our allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of our customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  we may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was  at december  allowance for excess and obsolete inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture  or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve and twenty four months 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories at december   was  warranty accrual our products are generally covered by a standard one year warranty from the date of sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized  based on anticipated parts and labor costs  utilizing historical experience 
our warranty accrual at december   was  deferred tax assets the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income which we believe is more likely than not 
we anticipate future taxable income sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
historically  we have generated operating income 
future taxable income is based on our forecasts of operating results  and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved 
our deferred tax assets at december  were inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
interest rate risk we are potentially exposed to market risk from interest rate changes in our credit agreement 
under the terms of our credit agreement  we may borrow at the prime rate of interest or libor plus a margin of 
for borrowings under our credit agreement  we typically lock into a fixed interest rate for periods between to days 
at december  and throughout  we had no borrowings outstanding 
foreign currency risk we denominate all foreign sales in us dollars and do not hedge against currency fluctuations 
we purchase components and supplies from several japanese suppliers 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition  but could in the future by causing our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of foreign manufacturers or by causing the costs of our material supplies to increase 
we make all of our purchases in us dollars and we believe that we have reduced the risks of increased purchasing costs that would otherwise occur if the dollar weakens relative to the yen 
we have foregone the opportunity  however  to benefit from the full potential cost savings if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen 
equity price risk we do not generally invest in marketable equity securities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  comprising approximately of our total assets 
given the current low rates of interest  a sustained decrease in the rate of interest earned would not have a material adverse effect on our business
