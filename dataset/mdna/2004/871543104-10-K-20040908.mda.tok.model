we hold significant patent portfolios in advanced control algorithms and algorithms using the global positioning system gps and code division multiple access cdma 
our technology improves the performance and operability of the telecommunication infrastructure 
in fiscal  we actively participated in the modernization of several synchronization networks with certain service providers  and helped others to develop future plans for such efforts 
the carriers and operators are being driven by network economics and competitive forces to evolve their network infrastructure toward integrated transmission and switching functions and packet based technologies 
we believe this evolutionary trend  in turn  demands a more intelligent and reliable synchronization infrastructure 
the introduction of timeprovider in fiscal has complemented our portfolio of synchronization solutions and addresses the growing synchronization requirements of the access layer of the network 
the symmetricom global services sgs segment provides services for all our product lines and continued growing its business during this fiscal year by expanding its product offerings for the telecom solutions division with innovative new services such as sync office audits and spares support

industry background the markets served by symmetricom include wireline infrastructure and oem telecommunications synchronization  broadband access and timing  test and measurement instrumentation for aerospace  defense  enterprise and power utilities 
the past three fiscal years have posed a tremendous challenge to the telecommunications industry 
carriers and service providers have struggled with rapid changes in their customer base  high customer turn over  competition  evolving business models  continuing changes in the regulatory environment and changing service demands 
carriers and service providers continue to scrutinize their capital expenditures closely and continue to focus on leveraging their investments 
in this environment  efficient use of the existing infrastructure becomes critical to the service provider s success 
the time and frequency industry may be divided into the following markets wireline infrastructure systems  oem products  specialty manufacturing other and timing  test and measurement 
wireline infrastructure systems market the wireline infrastructure market includes local  long distance  and international telecommunications service providers and carriers 
customers in this market include worldwide public network providers  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  public telephone and telegraph companies ptts  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  and other telephone companies and cable companies 
demand from most of this sector has declined over the past three fiscal years as network service providers continue to decrease their capital spending 
in the united states  there is continued uncertainty regarding telecommunication de regulation policies  and we believe this uncertain environment has contributed to the reduced spending by service providers 
we believe that the need to make networks efficient  the need for greater reliability  and the demand for better quality of service in the infrastructure may enhance the need for synchronization over the long term 
further  new wireless technologies may require higher quality synchronization in the network infrastructure and as these new technologies are deployed we can expect to see increasing demand for synchronization 
however  the adoption of such new technologies may occur slowly 

table of contents oem products market a major portion of our oem products market is the wireless communications market 
wireless telecommunications networks consist of numerous cells located throughout a service area 
in a wireless network  calls are segmented  transmitted over the air  and reassembled by a receiver within the network 
in certain wireless technologies  lack of proper synchronization may result in signal degradation and dropped calls and loss of data  thereby decreasing network efficiency and capacity 
furthermore  certain engineering requirements demand a high level of synchronization to support a greater number of callers simultaneously 
currently the next generation wireless base stations supporting g is the target market for our oem technology and products 
in addition  historically our wireless business has generated lower margins than our wireline business 
broadband access is another part of our oem products segment 
broadband access continues to be a major growth area for carriers worldwide 
the demand for bandwidth from businesses continues to grow steadily  and broadband service providers have focused on meeting the increased demand by more efficiently utilizing their existing infrastructure 
symmetricom s gowide family of broadband access products allow carriers to offer enhanced high speed data services to their business customers through their existing dsl infrastructure 
currently  our g 
shdsl products are an emerging market primarily deployed in europe 
specialty manufacturing market our production facility in puerto rico is outfitted to provide specialty contract manufacturing to select clients 
customers in this market are mainly from the semiconductor industry 
this was a growth market in fiscal timing  test and measurement market time and frequency instruments are important for expanding government and commercial communications systems of wireline  wireless  satellite and computer network technologies  as well as for synchronizing critical infrastructures such as us power generation and the distribution grid 
the increase in demand for precision timing is due in part to the growth in communications and computer network systems worldwide 
growth in data  voice and video transmissions on these networks is anticipated to lead to an increased demand for substantial bandwidth compared to traditional voice traffic 
we believe that the current trend of integrating wireline  wireless  satellite and computer network systems and the wide spread growth of the internet and e commerce will lead to increased demand for precision time and frequency products as more data crosses these networks and as demand for these services grows and the financial health of the service providers remains strong 
in addition  we believe the network centric activities within private and public businesses that are installing  growing or maintaining internet protocol networks of computer servers and clients may also drive growth in the demand for time and frequency products 
information control in the network  as well as applications support requiring synchronized time of day on a secure ip infrastructure  are driving the implementation of accurate network time appliances on the network 
we believe these trends will continue and will drive future growth in the demand for network based time and frequency products and services 
products we provide infrastructure solutions for the global communications market 
we are a leading provider of synchronization  timing  and frequency solutions 
the following discussion includes products from each of our five reportable segments wireline products  oem products  global services  specialty manufacturing other and timing  test and measurement products 
wireline products the telecommunications network consists of a series of interconnected switching equipment and other components that route information ie voice  video  data etc 
throughout the network 
for these networks to function efficiently  it is essential that each network be synchronized and individual nodes within the network 
table of contents operate within very precise tolerances 
precision synchronization equipment throughout these networks provides a frequency reference to enable digital switching and transmission systems to operate at a common  or synchronized  clock rate  therefore minimizing signal degradation and reducing errors in the transmission of data throughout a network 
our core wireline systems products are built on atomic clock technologies such as cesium and rubidium and gps 
the products belong to one of three classes primary reference sources prss consists of the gps based timesource family  and the cesium based timecesium 
building integrated timing supplies bits or stand alone synchronization equipment sase the versatile ssu and the carrier class timehub  both intelligent sync distribution systems 
element management systems timepictra  the carrier class hp ux based system and the pc based timescan system 
in addition to these classes  we introduced timeprovider  the industry s first node clock hybrid sase prs  which is planned to bring synchronization to the edge of the telecommunications network 
oem products the primary use of our wireless products is within wireless base stations 
base stations are the infrastructure equipment used in all cellular and personal communication services worldwide 
many of the wireless technologies used today require very high precision frequency and timing information to operate their services 
our component and sub system module products deliver stable timing to wireless base stations using a combination of gps receivers for timing distribution  high precision quartz oscillators and rubidium atomic oscillators 
their use depends on the specific cellular technology such as cdma or wideband cdma and the governing standards that apply 
for example  in cdma  most manufacturers require gps for every base station with either a high performance quartz or rubidium oscillator 
in addition  enhanced e services  which include wireless location technology helping emergency services personnel locate and provide assistance to wireless callers much more quickly  and similar location based services require technology that utilizes accurate timing typically derived from gps for the location measurement unit lmu products 
these solutions are also available to other communication applications requiring very high precision frequency and timing information  such as digital television transmission  high definition television  and instrumentation 
specific products we provide are rubidium atomic oscillators with various performance levels 
gps accessory components which include receiving antennas  timing antennas  splitters  amplifiers  and lightning protectors 
sub system cards or modules used within another manufacturer s equipment such as wireless base stations  or broadband wireless solutions 
these are customized per manufacturer  using a combination of gps  quartz oscillators  rubidium atomic oscillators  input output signals  and control algorithms 
some of the control algorithms are contained in our bestime technology 
another product family within oem products is our broadband access products 
incumbent carriers are moving transport of traditional data services away from legacy equipment to new infrastructure equipment in order to lower their operational costs 
alternate carriers are moving to deliver cost effective competitive services over their atm based digital subscriber line access multiplexers dslams 

table of contents our gowide   and symmetrical high speed digital subscriber line shdsl modems portfolio offers higher data rates  greater reach and enhanced spectral compatibility when compared to legacy transport technologies 
these products deliver high speeds by bundling multiple dsl links  and focus on circuit emulation applications 
in addition  our gowide network termination units provide private line and frame relay services over shdsl utilizing the carrier s atm network 
carriers choosing shdsl to deploy services delivering higher symmetrical speeds  enhanced routing  and security capabilities are all potential users of gowide 
these products deliver high value features demanded by small to medium sized businesses requiring increased data bandwidth 
currently  deployment of our broadband products has been primarily in europe and acceptance of g 
shdsl has been slow in the us symmetricom global services our global services provides lifecycle services for all symmetricom product lines 
services products fall into five main categories engineering and installation our engineering and installation services help customers implement new symmetricom product purchases 
operations and growth support programs our operations and growth support programs like sync office audits assist customers in maintenance of their sync networks  help ensure power and alarm diversity to avoid service outages and identify system capacity 
maintenance our maintenance offerings are designed to help customers minimize staff and expenses necessary for ongoing support of their symmetricom products 
these include x technical support  traditional return to factory repair services and on site repair labor 
innovative new offerings such as our spares support contract are proving to be an attractive alternative to traditional spares and repair programs 
training  certification programs and professional development courses our training courses enable customer personnel to successfully utilize and maintain our products 
these programs are also available under license for customers who maintain their own training centers 
consulting and other professional services our consulting services assist customers in planning new sync networks and developing growth or disaster recovery plans for existing sync networks 
specialty manufacturing other products our services and products can vary according to client specifications 
we normally manufacture semiconductor equipment 
also included in this segment are any products that are not specifically allocable to another division 
timing  test and measurement products we offer a wide variety of precision time and frequency products 
these products can generally be divided into the following broad categories precise time and frequency products we manufacture precision time products that allow our customers to keep accurate time within billionths of a second in a hour period 
in many ways  our precise time products are similar to clocks and stopwatches our clocks tell us the time of day and allow us to measure the time interval between when an event starts and when it stops 
the difference between conventional time measuring devices and our precise time products lies in the accuracy of the measurements 
to place the accuracy of our clocks in perspective  a clock which accumulates a billionth of a second time error over a hour period will require more than  years to accumulate an error of one second 

table of contents quartz based clocks are subject to numerous physical factors that affect the overall clock accuracy and stability  including temperature changes and aging 
we rely upon gps as a timing reference for continuously disciplining our oscillators  the fundamental component that determines the accuracy of our time and frequency products 
gps provides hour worldwide coverage that is not affected by weather conditions 
coverage by satellites in six near polar orbits together with numerous ground monitoring verifying stations produces a readily available and highly accurate timing reference 
however  gps navigation receivers tend to deliver compromised results when used as a time and frequency receiver 
to overcome this shortcoming in a standard gps receiver  we have developed proprietary receiver technology optimizing time and frequency that utilizes commercially available gps electronics 
for our older products utilizing a standard gps receiver  we employ proprietary algorithms and firmware to extract optimal accuracy and stability from the clock measurements provided by the gps core receiver 
we believe our products contain superior oscillator disciplining technology that enables us to offer extremely accurate quartz oscillator timing products 
computer plug in cards we manufacture a broad line of precision timing products in the form of plug in cards for computers 
these cards provide precise timing capabilities to computers equipped with very common bus components 
aside from providing accurate time measurement  these cards can provide a variety of time and frequency and other time outputs and functions  as well as time transfer for synchronization 
currently  plug in cards connected by cables provide an easy and accurate way to synchronize the clocks of two or more computers 
we also offer software development tools to speed the integration of these cards into software applications  which may save software developers significant time and money 
computer network time servers we manufacture several products for computer network time distribution 
these products provide an extremely powerful and efficient manner in which to bring entire networks of computers into precise time synchronization 
designated computers run programs in the background that periodically adjust the time of each local computer to that of the time server 
as a result  we believe that network synchronization of thousands of computers to an accuracy of a second or less is achievable using these products 
with the pervasive growth of the internet and e commerce and increasing electronic transactions  we believe that the demand for such synchronization products will increase 
time code products we offer a wide variety of time code generation  translation and synchronization products  including timing output options for our precise clocks 
a time code is a data format for recording and processing time measurements 
time codes arose from the need to synchronize the instruments used to monitor the many aspects of a real time weapons test and to share the collected data with others monitoring the same test at different locations 
time codes provide the digital data format necessary for computers to transfer and correlate encoded time data among computers in a highly accurate manner 
time displays these one half inch to four inch light emitting diode  or led  displays often present a variety of information including the time of day  frequency information regarding system electrical current  or countdown to launch arrays 
in many cases  the display is sold as an accessory to a precision clock to display the precise time in an instrument rack or control room 
precision frequency references precision frequency references form the basis of absolute time and frequency in many systems and applications 
our products include active hydrogen masers  cesium frequency standards  rubidium frequency standards and quartz frequency standards 
our primary reference source instruments provide stand alone dependability  ease of use  and ease of installation that make them suitable for the critical time or frequency systems found in telecommunications timing  calibration and metrology laboratories  satellite tracking stations and space based master time standards 
space  defense and avionics we offer products that use cesium  rubidium and quartz technologies for a wide range of uses  whether it is a defense related mobile terrestrial or airborne platform  or a satellite platform in space 
we provide rugged and militarized quartz and atomic clock platforms for the most 
table of contents demanding military satellite applications 
for applications such as an f fighter plane  our designs are vibration isolated with low acceleration sensitivity 
for space applications such as gps  where there is a high degree of exposure to radiation  our products are protected by radiation hardened designs 
small size  low power demand  fast warm up capability  superior stability and superior spectral purity make these devices suitable for critical and tactical aerospace applications like radio navigation  satellite transmission  and tracking and guidance systems

in june  we announced that our manufacturing operations in our irvine facility would be consolidated into our beverly  massachusetts facility 
the integration was completed in december item legal proceedings in late  datum which we acquired in october received notice of potential environmental contamination from the owner of a premises in austin  texas that had previously been occupied by austron  inc  a datum subsidiary for its wireline operation austron  prior to datum s acquisition of austron in although austron had remediated the site pursuant to then existing environmental regulations in connection with vacating the site in  the applicable environmental regulations were modified after  providing the basis for the property owner s claim that the soil at the site contains the same contaminants that were the focus of austron s previous remediation efforts 
in compliance with current law  datum had established the extent of the site contamination  which extends to adjoining properties owned by third parties 
in may  we received a demand from the owner of several adjoining lots for damages  as well as seeking an indemnity for the contamination and a promise to remediate the contamination 
the adjacent property owner has not filed suit but  if a suit is filed  we will contest it vigorously 
we believe that we will continue to incur monitoring costs for the next several years in connection with the site contamination and may be subject to demands and claims from other adjoining landowners in addition to the claim for remediation discussed above  and the amount of such costs and the extent of the our exposure to such claims cannot be determined at this time

with the fiscal addition of customers from truetime and datum  we entered into the government defense and industry sectors 
in june  we discontinued the operation of the trusted time division and integrated the broadband network division into the telecom solutions division 
the trusted time division was acquired as part of the acquisition of datum in october the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
certain charges related to the discontinuance of this operation  including a non cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles associated with this business  were taken in fiscal on october   we completed our acquisition of datum 
each share of datum common stock outstanding was converted into the right to receive shares of symmetricom common stock

the acquisition of datum was intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization within the meaning of section a of internal revenue code and was accounted for as a purchase 
on october   we acquired certain assets from netmonitor 
the acquisition was accounted for as an asset purchase 
we paid  in cash for the acquired assets and incurred direct acquisition costs of approximately  the net purchase price was allocated to tangible assets of  and existing technology of  on october   we completed our acquisition of truetime

critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the 
table of contents reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
symmetricom considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for warranty  inventory valuation  capitalized acquisition costs  accounting for income taxes  valuation of investments and valuation of intangible assets and goodwill to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
business combinations we allocated the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engaged an independent third party appraisal firm to assist us in determining the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimations and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  also the brand awareness and the market position of the acquired products and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
revenue recognition our standard arrangement for our domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products 
revenue from sales of product and software licenses is recognized when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
revenue from post sale customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the support contract 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
we assess collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we recognize the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
we commonly have transactions that involve sales of both product and services to our customers 
product revenue is generated from the sale of synchronization and timing equipment with embedded software that is essential to product functionality 
we account for these transactions in accordance with the rules applicable to software revenue recognition 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed  provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for returns or credits under certain circumstances 
accordingly  we defer an estimate of returns from distributors based on a historical average of distributor returns 
we record commission expense when orders are shipped  at which time the commission is both earned and payable 
revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
table of contents of accounting  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs to complete the individual contracts 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
warranty reserve our standard warranty agreement is one year from shipment 
however  our warranty agreements are contract and component specific and can range to twenty years for selected components 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
our warranty reserve is based on the number of installed units  historical analysis of the volume of product returned to us under the warranty program  management s judgment regarding anticipated rates of warranty claims and associated repair costs 
we use the historical data to forecast our anticipated future warranty obligations 
this analysis is updated on a quarterly basis 
we offer extended warranty contracts on products that are less than eight years old 
the extended warranty contract is applicable for a maximum of nine years after the expiration of the standard one year warranty 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  we record a specific allowance based on the amount that we believe will be uncollected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  we record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts on a periodic basis 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value less costs to sell  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand  and technological obsolescence 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
during fiscal  we charged million to cost of goods sold to write down excess and obsolete inventory 
accounting for income taxes the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations outside the united states  primarily in puerto rico 
net earnings of our puerto rico subsidiary are taxed under internal revenue code section  which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income tax 
section limits the amount of qualified puerto rico earnings and expires in fiscal year the change in tax law may affect our future tax rate 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of tax deductions and net operating loss carryforwards  assumes we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully realize these deductions 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired  resulting in an additional income tax expense 
a significant portion of our tax credits is related to stock options and have a valuation allowance because of uncertainty regarding their realization 
if these tax credits are realized  the benefit will be credited to common stock 

table of contents valuation of investments we did not carry any investments in public or private companies during fiscal during fiscal  we concluded that our million investment in sarantel ltd  a privately held company  was not realizable and the investment was expensed as a loss on equity investment 
during fiscal  we concluded that the decline in value of our investment in the common stock of parthus technologies plc parthus was other than temporary and recorded million as a loss on equity investment  based on the quoted fair value of parthus common stock on the date the impairment loss was recorded 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets primarily include goodwill  purchased technology and trademarks 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value  and the remaining amortization period may be adjusted 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
if an impairment charge is recognized  the amortization related to intangible assets would decrease during the remainder of the fiscal year 
in fiscal  no impairment losses were recorded based on these evaluations 
in fiscal  we recorded million goodwill impairment in fiscal  million of which related to the discontinuance of the trusted time division 
option repurchase and exchange on may   we commenced an offer i to purchase for cash from our eligible employees all outstanding stock options with exercise prices of or greater that were granted under the symmetricom employee stock option plan the symmetricom plan or the datum inc incentive stock plan the datum plan and ii to exchange for shares of restricted stock under the symmetricom plan all outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock held by certain of our officers granted under either the symmetricom plan or the datum plan with exercise prices of or greater 
pursuant to the offer to purchase  we purchased and cancelled options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
pursuant to the offer to exchange  we exchanged and cancelled options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million shares of restricted stock 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in our consolidated statement of operations

net revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal part of this increase was due to the acquisitions of truetime and datum in the second quarter of fiscal on a pro forma basis  including the fiscal pre acquisition revenue for truetime and datum  net revenue in fiscal was million 
based on these pro forma results  net revenue in fiscal increased  or million  compared to net revenue in fiscal net revenue in fiscal included million in net revenue from our wireline products segment  million from our oem products segment  million from our global services segment  million from our specialty manufacturing and million from our timing  test and measurement segment 
the increase in net revenue of million  after accounting for the increase due to acquisitions  was mainly attributable to an increase of million in our wireline products segment  an increase of million in our oem products segment  an increase of million in our global services segment  an increase of million in specialty manufacturing segment  and an increase of million in our timing  test and measurement segment 
the increase in the wireline products segment was partly due to a combination of upgrades to the synchronization infrastructure of customers  as well as synchronization deployment to support the build out for the next generation of telecommunication infrastructure 
the increase in the oem products segment was partly due to increased purchases by wireless equipment manufacturers 
the increase in specialty manufacturing 
table of contents segment was due to increased demand from our primary customers 
the increase in global services segment was due to increases in revenue from our wireline and oem products 
the increase in the timing  test and measurement segment was partly due to continued strength in the government communications sector 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage of is primarily due to a gross profit improvement from our cost of products and services  a improvement from the fiscal write off of our telmax royalty and a improvement from continuing amortization of purchased technology resulting from the datum and truetime acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in gross profit due to increased integration and restructuring charges  mainly related to relocation of our irvine  california manufacturing to our beverly  massachusetts facility 
the improvement in gross profit from cost of products and services was a result of the truetime and datum acquisition synergies 
these manufacturing synergies included a full year savings impact due to the fiscal move of our austin  texas formerly datum manufacturing operations to puerto rico  the partial year impact from the move of one half of our irvine  california formerly datum manufacturing operations to puerto rico during the first quarter of fiscal  and the partial year impact from the completion of the move of the remaining irvine  california operations to our beverly  massachusetts facility 
the decrease in gross profit from integration and restructuring charges related to the relocations 
we anticipate continued improvements in gross profit as a result of initiatives to improve efficiencies at our plants 
operating expense research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  prototype expenses  and fees paid to outside consultants 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million decrease in research and development expenses is primarily due to reductions in headcount and expenses for the broadband network division and due to headcount and expense reductions in san jose  california  austin  texas and irvine  california related primarily to the synergies from the acquisitions 
we expect to continue to support research and development efforts in order to enhance existing products and to design and develop new technologies and products and for fiscal expenses to be consistent with fiscal expenses 
selling  general and administrative  including amortization of intangible assets selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  sales commissions and travel related expenses for our sales and services  finance  human resources  information technology and facilities departments 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  we had a total of employees in our selling  general and administrative departments  compared to employees in fiscal the decrease in headcount resulted from restructuring plans for the integration of truetime and datum 
however  expenses decreased by only because the savings from headcount reductions were partially offset by million of costs related to our compliance process for the sarbanes oxley act of and million in unplanned severance expenses 
we plan to add to personnel to the sales  service and marketing organizations during fiscal in june  we issued to senior executives  shares of restricted stock valued at million 
the restricted stock has a five year vesting schedule june but may vest sooner if certain quarterly earnings per share goals are achieved 
we expense the cost of these restricted shares ratably over the five year vesting 
table of contents period 
if we achieve cumulative earnings per share of over four consecutive quarters  then of the restricted stock grant will immediately vest on an accelerated basis 
since we achieved cumulative earnings per share of in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  if we achieve an aggregate earnings per share of in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we will record additional compensation expense to recognize the cost of vesting of the restricted stock grant 
integration and restructuring charges during fiscal  we recorded integration and restructuring charges of million in acquisition related costs and other restructuring expenses 
of these costs  million is related to our facility restructuring in irvine  california and million is for land remediation accruals related to a former datum facility in austin  texas 
see note o of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of integration and restructuring charges 
impairment of goodwill we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
during fiscal we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
we completed the acquisition of truetime and datum during the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the acquisitions of truetime and datum during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million of goodwill 
this goodwill was based upon the values assigned to the transactions at the time they were announced march for truetime and may for datum  using a symmetricom stock price of and per share  respectively 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal on december   when the symmetricom stock price was  which represented a decline of and from the symmetricom stock price as of the acquisition announcement dates for truetime and datum  respectively  management determined that goodwill was likely impaired as forecasts for anticipated revenue growth for the telecommunications industry had declined since the transactions were valued 
we compared the fair values of the reporting units to their respective carrying values and determined that the carrying values for two of the reporting units were impaired 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows based on management s estimates of future revenues 
we recorded the million excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value as an impairment loss in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
during fiscal  in addition to the goodwill impairment test performed as of december   we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal as of june   and determined that goodwill from continuing operations was not impaired 
however  due to the discontinued operations of the trusted time division  we recorded an impairment charge from continuing operations of million for goodwill associated with that division 
acquired in process research and development expenses during fiscal  we did not record any purchased in process research and development expense 
during fiscal  million of the purchase price of the datum and truetime acquisitions was allocated to purchased in process research and development expense based upon the values assigned to the acquisitions 
projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
the million represented million from datum and million from truetime 
the projected value of 
table of contents these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
the nature of the efforts to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relates to the completion of all prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can meet its design specification including function  features and technical performance requirements 
therefore  the amount allocated to in process research and development has been charged to operations 
gain loss on sale of equity investments during fiscal  we did not record any net gains or losses on the sale of equity investments 
during fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million on the sale of equity investments due to impairment losses on investments 
interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a lower average cash balance during the first three quarters of fiscal  as well as lower average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal we expect interest income to increase during fiscal  mainly due to our higher cash balance as of june  and the expectation that our cash balance will increase during fiscal interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital lease for our headquarters building in san jose  california 
interest expense remained consistent at million in fiscal and we do not expect a significant change in interest expense during fiscal income tax benefit our income tax benefit was million effective tax rate of in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million effective tax rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate has fluctuated significantly as a result of the impact of the fiscal write off or impairment of non deductible goodwill and disposition of business lines 
our effective tax rate has also been affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rico earnings compared to total earnings  as most of our puerto rico earnings are taxed under section of the us internal revenue code  which exempts qualified puerto rico earnings from federal income taxes 
this exemption is subject to wage based and other limitations and expires at the end of fiscal gain loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in june  we discontinued the operation of the trusted time division as part of our post acquisition consolidation process 
the division was acquired as part of the acquisition of datum in october the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a gain of  from our discontinued operations  and expect these operations to cease during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million loss  or per share  net of taxes  of which million was due to the loss on disposal  and million were operational losses 
the loss from disposal consisted of an million goodwill impairment charge and a million impairment charge for intangible assets 
net loss as a result of the factors above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal years ended june  and net revenue net revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net revenue of million was attributable to the acquisitions of datum and truetime in october net revenue in fiscal included million in net revenue from our wireline products segment  million from our wireless products segment  million from our timing  test and measurement segment  million from our broadband network segment and million from our global services segment 
the net revenue increase of million is comprised primarily of two components an increase of million for the timing  test and measurement segment sales which relates to the datum and truetime acquisitions and an increase of million in net revenue for our wireless segment  also due to the datum and truetime acquisitions 
revenue increases in the wireline and global services segments also relate to the datum and truetime acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  including datum and truetime  net revenue in fiscal were million as compared to the pro forma revenue of million in fiscal  or a decrease of 
gross profit gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal a decrease in gross profit percentage of is primarily due to three items integration and restructuring charges accounted for a decrease of  increased amortization of product technology due to acquisitions accounted for a decrease of  and write off of telmax prepaid royalty accounted for a decrease of 
these decreases were partially offset by a margin improvement due to sales volume 
operating expense research and development research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the dollar increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to spending for the products acquired in the datum and truetime acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative  including amortization of intangible assets selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was due to our acquisitions of truetime and datum 
in fiscal  we had a total of employees in our selling  general and administrative departments  compared to employees in fiscal integration and restructuring charges during fiscal  we recorded integration and restructuring charges of million in acquisition related costs and other restructuring expenses

as part of the facility consolidation  we exited several of our leased buildings and included the future lease payments  net of anticipated sublease revenue  in the charge 

table of contents impairment of goodwill we completed the acquisition of truetime and datum during the second quarter of fiscal in connection with these acquisitions  we recorded an additional million of goodwill 
this goodwill was based upon the values assigned to the transactions at the time they were announced march for truetime and may for datum  using a symmetricom stock price of and per share  respectively 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal on december   when the symmetricom stock price was  which represented a decline of and from the symmetricom stock price as of the acquisition announcement dates for truetime and datum  respectively  management determined that goodwill was likely impaired as forecasts for anticipated revenue growth for the telecommunications industry had declined since the transactions were valued 
we compared the fair values of the reporting units to their respective carrying values and determined that the carrying values for two of the reporting units were impaired 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the present value of estimated future cash flows based on management s estimates of future revenues 
we recorded the million excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value as an impairment loss in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to the discontinued operations of the trusted time division  we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal for goodwill associated with that division 
acquired in process research and development expenses during fiscal  million of the purchase price of the datum and truetime acquisitions was allocated to purchased in process research and development expense based upon the values assigned to the acquisitions 
the million represented million from datum and million from truetime 
the value of these projects was determined by estimating the discounted net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of the projects  reduced by the portion of the revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage of completion of the project 
gain loss on sale of equity investments during fiscal  we recorded a loss of million in losses on equity investments 
the loss was due to million loss on the sale of parthus technologies plc common stock and a million impairment of our investment in sarantel ltd 
during fiscal  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of our investment in brocade common stock 
during fiscal  we also concluded that the value of our investment in the common stock of parthus was other than temporary 
to determine that the value of our investment was other than temporary  we considered both the duration of the decline and the extent to which the market value of parthus common stock was below our recorded cost basis in the common stock 
market value is determined based on the share prices as quoted on the nasdaq national market 
accordingly  million was recorded as an impairment loss on investments 
interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our short term investments as well as lower average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense consists primarily of interest on our capital lease for our headquarters building in san jose  california 
interest expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents income tax benefit our income tax benefit was million effective tax rate of in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million effective tax rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate fluctuated as a result of the impact of the write off or impairment of non deductible goodwill and the acquisition and disposition of business lines 
gain loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in june  we discontinued the operation of the trusted time division as part of our post acquisition consolidation process 
the division was acquired as part of the acquisition of datum in october the division has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  the results of operations have been excluded from continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a million loss  net of taxes  of which million was due to the loss on disposal  and million were operational losses 
the loss from disposal consisted of an million goodwill impairment charge and a million impairment charge for intangible assets 
during fiscal  we recognized a million gain  net of taxes  for discontinued operations related to linfinity 
this gain relates to the release of funds from an escrow account established in connection with the sale during fiscal of our linfinity microelectronics  inc semiconductor subsidiary 
net loss as a result of the factors above  we incurred a net loss of million  or per basic and diluted share  in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal key operating metrics key operating metrics for measuring our performance include sales backlog  contract revenue  headcount and deferred revenue 
these metrics  which compare fiscal with fiscal  are listed below 
sales backlog our backlog consists of firm orders that have yet to be shipped to the customer  or may not be shippable to a customer until a future period 
most orders included in backlog can be rescheduled or cancelled by customers without significant penalty 
historically  a substantial portion of net revenue in any fiscal period has been derived from orders received during that fiscal period 
our total backlog amounted to million as of june   compared to million as of june  our backlog which is shippable within the next six months was million as of june   compared to million as of june  contract revenue revenue from contracts that require development and manufacture in accordance with customer specifications and have a lengthy development period is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  principally based upon the costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs to complete the individual contracts 
revenue from long term contracts is reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
any anticipated losses on contracts are fully charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
as of june   we have approximately million in contract revenue to be performed and recognized within the next months  compared to approximately million in contract revenue that was to be performed and recognized within the following months as of june  these amounts have been accounted for as part of our sales backlog discussed above 
headcount our consolidated headcount as of june  comprised of regular employees and temporary employees  compared to regular employees and temporary employees as of june  
table of contents deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of deferred revenue on sales of goods with special terms  which are recognized when the special terms are satisfied  maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the maintenance period  and distributor return allowances  which are based on historical return averages with certain distributors 
deferred revenue for sales of goods with special terms was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for maintenance contracts was million as of june   compared to million as of june  deferred revenue for distributor return allowances was million as of june   compared to million as of june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   working capital was million compared to million as of june  and million as of june  cash and cash equivalents as of june  increased million to million from million as of june  this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in cash provided by operating activities  a million decrease in cash used for investing activities and a million increase in cash provided by financing activities 
short term investments increased from million as of june  to million as of june  this increase resulted primarily from the fact that we moved some of our cash equivalent investments to longer term corporate debt securities  which changed their classification to short term investments 
the million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to non cash expenses related to depreciation and amortization of million and an increase in accounts payable of million  which was partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a net loss of million 
the increase in accounts receivable was the result of higher sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same quarter in fiscal the million net cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to million in purchases of short term investments and million in purchases of plant and equipment  which was partially offset by million in maturities of short term investments and million decrease in restricted cash as a result of our line of credit set up with wells fargo bank  which did not require us to hold restricted cash 
the million net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a million in proceeds from issuance of common stock due to stock option exercises  which was offset by million in scheduled repayments of our long term obligations 
our total capital commitments outstanding as of june  were million 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days as of june   a decrease from days as of june  this decrease is attributable to a higher rate of cash collections during the fiscal fourth quarter ended june  compared to the same period in fiscal we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and working capital expenditure needs in the ordinary course of business for at least the next months and the foreseeable future 
we base our expense levels in part on our expectation of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than we expect  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we require additional capital resources to grow our business or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses in the future  we may seek to issue additional equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
on may   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association to obtain a revolving line of credit up to million to be used as working capital

table of contents factors that may affect results our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to our investors we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the resumption of recent adverse economic conditions  particularly within the telecommunications equipment industry  which may result in revenue declines  restructuring and integration related charges  goodwill impairment charges related to our recent acquisitions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components at commercially reasonable prices  changes in our products or mix of sales to customers  our ability to manage fluctuations in manufacturing yields of rubidium oscillators and cesium tubes  our ability to manage the level and value of our inventories in relation to sales volume  our ability to accurately anticipate the volume and timing of customer orders or customer cancellations  our ability to collect receivables from our customers  including those in the telecommunications industry  the gain or loss of significant customers  our ability to introduce new products on a timely and cost effective basis  customer delays in qualification of new products  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products and our competitors products  our ability to manage increased competition and competitive pricing pressures  our ability to manage fluctuations  especially declines  in the average selling prices of our products  our ability to manage the long sales cycle associated with our products  our ability to manage cyclical conditions in the telecommunications industry  our ability to retain key employees if the economic marketplace improves  which could affect our ability to sell  develop and deliver our products  reduced rates of growth of telecommunications services  customers may delay upgrading their old equipment with our new products  international customers may delay purchasing products for increased voice  data and video traffic  customers in the wireless market may delay adding new base stations which require our products  and customers may experience labor strikes which could result in reduced sales volume 
a significant portion of our operating and manufacturing expenses are relatively fixed in nature and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected future sales shortfall  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
our operations entail a high level of fixed costs and require an adequate volume of production and sales to achieve and maintain reasonable gross profit margins and net earnings 
if we increase the volume of product 
table of contents manufacturing by outside sources and decrease our internal production  we could incur higher fixed costs per unit and integration and restructuring charges 
significant decreases in demand for our products or reduction in our average selling prices  or any material delay in customer orders may negatively harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future results depend in large part on growth in the markets for our products 
the growth in each of these markets may depend on changes in general economic conditions  conditions related to the markets in which we compete  changes in regulatory conditions  legislation  export rules or conditions  interest rates and fluctuations in the business cycle for any particular market segment 
if our quarterly or annual operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly 
we experienced net operating losses in the past and may experience net operating losses again in the future we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  although we had net earnings for both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain operating profitability 
if we are unable to maintain operating profitability or if we incur future losses and negative cash flow  our stock price may decline 
if we incur net losses in the future  we may have to record a valuation allowance against most or all of our deferred tax assets  which would significantly increase our tax expense and hurt our net earnings we had a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  and a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  continued losses may create uncertainty about the recoverability of our million net deferred tax asset 
if we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we would record an additional tax expense  which would reduce net earnings 
in addition  these uncertainties about the recoverability of our deferred tax assets would limit our ability to recognize future deferred tax assets on our balance sheet and correspondingly reduce net earnings 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  our management reviews the results of operations for that quarter  and forecasts for the remainder of the fiscal year and future years  to determine if it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is needed 
the economic downturn in the telecommunications industry has negatively impacted the demand for our products and may impair our customers ability to pay us the telecommunications industry  from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue  has experienced a general economic downturn over the last three years 
this downturn has negatively affected many of our customers and has significantly weakened the financial condition of others 
some customers have filed for bankruptcy protection and others may do so as well 
if a customer seeks bankruptcy protection it could result in nonpayment for products delivered  the cancellation of one or more contracts and the loss of a customer 
in addition  any continued decline in demand in the telecommunications industry could delay decisions by some of our customers to renew their agreements or relationships with us or could delay decisions by prospective customers to make initial evaluations of our products 
reductions or delays in expenditures for our products  nonpayment for products delivered and the cancellation of contracts and the loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we purchase certain key components of our synchronization and timing equipment from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these sources fail to fulfill our needs we have limited suppliers for a number of our components  which are key components of our synchronization and timing equipment 
if single source components were to become unavailable on satisfactory terms  we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
if for any reason we could not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
in addition  some of our suppliers require long lead times to 
table of contents deliver requested quantities of components 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of components  we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments  which could also have a material adverse effect on our business  result of operations and financial condition 
due to rapid changes in technology  on occasion  one or more of the components used in our products have become unavailable  resulting in unanticipated redesign and related delays in shipments 
we cannot assure you that similar delays will not occur in the future 
we have relied and may continue to rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our net revenue  and our revenue could decline due to the delay of customer orders or cancellation of existing orders although a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue  no single customer accounted for or more of our net revenue during fiscal and however  we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
the timing and level of sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers  or a significant reduction or delay in sales to any customer  may harm our business and operating results 
major customers also have significant leverage and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  upon which we do business  which could also harm our business and operating results 
we have direct or indirect sales pursuant to contracts with united states government agencies  which can be terminated at the convenience of the government  and our revenue would decline if the government terminated these contracts historically  approximately to of our net revenue was made to united states government agencies either directly or indirectly through subcontracts 
government related contracts and subcontracts are subject to standard provisions for termination at the convenience of the government 
in such event  however  we are generally entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred on the basis of work completed plus other amounts specified in each individual contract 
these contracts and subcontracts are either fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
fixed price contracts provide fixed compensation for specified work 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we agree to perform specified work in return for reimbursement of costs to the extent allowable under government regulations and a specified fee 
in general  while the risk of loss is greater under fixed price contracts than under cost reimbursable contracts  the potential for profit under fixed price contracts is greater than under cost reimbursable contracts 
if we are unable to develop new products  or we are delayed in production startup  sales of our products could decline  which could reduce our revenue the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  frequent new product introductions  and customers may perceive new products as deficient if there is miscommunication about product specifications 
technological advancements could render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
our success will depend on our ability to respond to changing technologies and customer requirements and our ability to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a cost effective and timely manner 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of our new products and enhancements 

table of contents the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage a smooth transition from older products to new products 
delays in new product development or delays in production startup could reduce sales of our products  which would negatively impact our revenue 
our products are complex and may contain errors or design flaws  which could be costly to correct our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes and techniques 
when we release new products  or new versions of existing products  they may contain undetected or unresolved errors or defects 
despite testing  errors or defects may be found in new products or upgrades after the commencement of commercial shipments 
undetected errors and design flaws have occurred in the past and could occur in the future 
these errors could result in delays  loss of market acceptance and sales  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation  legal action by our customers  failure to attract new customers  and increased service and warranty costs 
the occurrence of any of these factors could cause our net revenue to decline 
the telecommunications market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets  our revenue could decline competition in the telecommunications industry in general  and in the markets we serve  is intense and likely to increase substantially 
we face competition in all of our markets 
competitors in our synchronization products segment include frequency electronics  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  microtel international inc and oscilloquartz sa 
competitors in our wireless segment include frequency electronics  inc and trimble navigation  ltd 
competitors in our broadband access segment include adtran  inc  cisco systems  inc  efficient networks  inc 
and thomson multimedia sa in the enterprise network timing market  we compete primarily with meinberg and endrun technologies 
in the cesium standards market  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  inc in the rubidium oscillators market  we compete primarily with frequency electronics  inc and temex 
in addition  certain companies  such as perkin elmer  inc that currently manufacture products for use in military applications  could enter commercial markets and compete directly with us 
competitors in our timing  test and measurement segment include frequency electronics  inc  trak systems  inc a veritas corporation subsidiary and brandywine communications 
in addition  the telecommunications act of permits ilecs to manufacture telecommunications equipment  which may result in increased competition 
our ability to compete successfully in the future will depend on many factors including the cost effectiveness  quality  price  service and market acceptance of our products  our response to the entry of new competitors into our markets or the introduction of new products by our competitors  the average selling prices received for our products  our ability to keep pace with changing technology and customer requirements  our continued improvement of existing products  the timely development or acquisition of new or enhanced products  the timing of new product introductions by our competitors or us  and changes in worldwide market and economic conditions 
many of our competitors or potential competitors are well established and have significant financial  manufacturing  technical and marketing resources 
these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new and emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products  or to deliver competitive products at lower prices 
we expect to continue to experience pricing pressures from our competitors in all of our markets 
if we are unable to compete by delivering new products or by delivering competitive products at lower prices  we could lose market share and our revenue could decline 

table of contents we may in the future have to take a lease impairment charge  which would negatively impact our operating results as a result of the acquisitions of datum and truetime  we have excess office and manufacturing space in california and texas that we are seeking to sublease 
should we be unable to find tenants for these vacant facilities  we may have to take additional lease impairment charges in future quarters that will negatively impact our operating results 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be weakened and our revenues may decline we believe our success will depend in a large part on our ability to protect trade secrets  obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we rely on a combination of trademark  copyright and patent registration  contractual restrictions and internal security to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
these measures may not provide sufficient protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we have united states and international patents and patent applications pending that cover certain technology used by our operations 
however  while we believe that our patents have value  we rely primarily on innovation  technological expertise and marketing competence to maintain our competitive position 
while we intend to continue our efforts to obtain patents whenever possible  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued  or that new  or existing patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted will provide us with any commercial benefit 
third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims  which would be difficult to defend  costly and may result in our loss of significant rights the telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
we are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
although we are currently not a party to any intellectual property litigation  from time to time we have received claims asserting that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others 
we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future  or that any such claims will not result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license for such intellectual property rights regardless of the merit of such claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  such licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we acquire other companies and are unable to smoothly integrate the businesses we acquire  our operations and financial results could be harmed as part of our business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions in the past  including the acquisitions of truetime and datum  and continue to evaluate other acquisition opportunities that could provide additional product or service offerings  technologies or additional industry expertise 
our recent acquisitions involve risks  which include the following we may be exposed to unknown liabilities of the acquired business  we may incur significant one time write offs  we may experience problems in combining the acquired operations  technologies or products  we may not realize the revenue and profits that we expect the acquired businesses to generate  we may not achieve the cost savings we hope to obtain from combining the acquired operations with ours  we may experience regulatory difficulties and unbudgeted expenses in attempting to complete an acquisition  we may encounter unanticipated acquisition or integration costs that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate  
table of contents our management s attention may be diverted from our core business  our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers may be impaired  we may not be successful in entering new markets in which we have no or limited experience  key employees of the acquired businesses may have expertise and know how  and we may not be able to retain some of these key employees  and some of them may join or start competing businesses  our stockholders may be diluted if we pay for an acquisition with equity securities  and for example  we recently discovered that the environmental remediation expense for the austin  texas plant we inherited as part of the datum acquisition could be more costly than we anticipated 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any business  products  technologies or personnel from any recent or future acquisitions 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions or to achieve any anticipated benefits of an acquisition  our operations and business could be harmed 
additionally  we may experience difficulty integrating and managing the acquired business operations 
for these reasons  we cannot be certain what effect acquisitions may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulations that could result in costly environmental liability our operations are subject to numerous international  federal  state and local environmental regulations related to the storage  use  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
while we have not experienced any significant effects on our operations from environmental regulations  changes in these regulations may require additional capital expenditures or restrict our ability to expand our operations 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in suspension or cessation of our operations or could subject us to significant liabilities 
although we periodically review our facilities and internal operations for compliance with applicable environmental regulations  these reviews are necessarily limited in scope and frequency and may not reveal all potential instances of noncompliance  possible injury or possible contamination 
the liabilities arising from any noncompliance with environmental regulations  or liability resulting from accidental contamination or injury from toxic or hazardous chemicals could result in liability that exceeds our resources 
the risk of liabilities increases as we acquire other companies  such as datum  which use  or have used  hazardous substances at various current or former facilities 
our manufacturing facility previously operated by datum in austin  texas is undergoing remediation for known subsurface contamination at that facility and adjoining properties 
we believe that we will incur monitoring costs for years to come in connection with this subsurface contamination 
further  we have received a demand from adjoining landowner and may be subject to claims from other adjoining landowners  in addition to claims for remediation  and the amount of these costs and the extent of our exposure to these demands and claims cannot be determined at this time 
the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination could involve costly and time consuming negotiations and litigation 
remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur additional unreimbursed costs and could harm on site operations and the future use and value of the property 
the remediation efforts  the property owners claims and any related governmental action may expose us to material liability and could significantly harm our business 
we are subject to various rules and regulations  which may cause us to incur significant compliance costs our customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with these regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our business is subject to various other significant international  federal  state and local  health and safety  packaging  product content and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have 
table of contents become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy past violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of its operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on its ability to carry on or expand our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation of other agencies such as the united states federal communications commission 
if we fail to adequately address any of these regulations  our business may suffer 
our customers may be subject to governmental regulations  which  if changed  could negatively impact our business results federal and state regulatory agencies  including the federal communications commission and the various state public utility commissions and public service commissions  regulate most of our domestic telecommunications customers 
similar government oversight also exists in the international market 
while we are not directly affected by this legislation  such regulation of our customers may negatively impact our business 
for instance  the sale of our products may be affected by the imposition upon certain of our customers of common carrier tariffs and the taxation of telecommunications services 
these regulations are continuously reviewed and changed by the various governmental agencies 
changes in current or future laws or regulations  in the united states or elsewhere  could negatively impact our business results 
sales of a significant portion of our products to customers outside of the united states subjects us to business  economic and political risks our export sales  which are primarily to western europe  latin america  the far east and canada  accounted for of net revenue during fiscal compared to of net revenue during fiscal we anticipate that sales to customers located outside of the united states will continue to be a significant part of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
because significant portions of our sales are to customers outside of the united states we are subject to risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  the effects of terrorist activity and armed conflict which may disrupt general economic activity and result in revenue shortfalls  the global sars severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic if it does not continue to be contained  or another epidemic  export restrictions  longer payment cycles  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competition  dependence on local vendors  and reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights and political and economic instability 
to date  very few of our international revenue and cost obligations have been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive  and thus  less competitive in foreign markets 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  including the euro  which will subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in these foreign currencies 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging activities or derivative arrangements  but may do so in the future to the extent that such obligations become more significant 

table of contents if we have significant inventories that become obsolete or cannot be sold at acceptable prices  our results may be negatively impacted although we believe that we currently have made adequate adjustments for inventory that has declined in value  become obsolete  or is in excess of anticipated demand  there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be adequate 
if significant inventories of our products become obsolete  or are otherwise not able to be sold at favorable prices  our business could be materially affected 
we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future quarters as of june   we had recorded goodwill with a net book value of million related to acquisitions of datum  truetime and certain assets of hewlett packard company s communication synchronization business 
we test for impairment at least annually and whenever evidence of an impairment exists 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for goodwill 
in connection with the discontinuance of the trusted time division in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional million impairment of goodwill 
if our future financial performance or other events indicate that the value of our recorded goodwill is impaired  we may record additional impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our reported results 
increases in our effective tax rate will negatively impact our cash flow our effective tax rate is affected by the percentage of qualified puerto rican earnings compared to our total earnings 
most of our puerto rican earnings are taxed under section of the united states internal revenue code  which exempts qualified puerto rican earnings from federal taxes when calculating our effective tax rate 
historically  using this exemption has reduced our effective tax rate 
our overall effective tax rate could increase during fiscal years and  as the exemption will become subject to additional limitations before it expires at the end of fiscal any increase in our effective tax rate will increase our federal income taxes and negatively impact our cash flow 
we may be subject to additional taxes from tax reviews by foreign authorities although we believe that we have made adequate reserves for foreign tax provisions  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate until the foreign authorities have reviewed the foreign tax filings 
our sales may be affected by the ongoing movement towards environmentally friendly manufacturing green manufacturing various countries in the international marketplace are moving towards more environmentally friendly manufacturing requirements  and some companies or countries may require us to meet new standards  which could affect the sales of our products 
these standards could possibly be based on the production methods of our manufacturing process  and materials used in this process 
if we have to change our methods or processes to comply  our manufacturing costs may increase 
investor confidence and share value may be adversely impacted if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with the attestation of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december   as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the securities and exchange commission  as directed by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  adopted rules requiring public companies to include a report of management on the company s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual reports on form k that contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
in addition  the company s independent 
table of contents auditors must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting 
this requirement will first apply to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending june  although we intend to diligently and vigorously review our internal controls over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with the section requirements  if our independent auditors are not satisfied with our internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which these controls are documented  designed  operated or reviewed  or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements  rules or regulations differently from us  then they may decline to attest to management s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified 
this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial marketplace due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which ultimately could negatively impact the market price of our shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure as of june   we had short term investments of million 
these investments in corporate debt securities have maturity dates of greater than three months 
our corporate debt securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing at june   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
additionally  a decrease in the market interest rates would not materially impact the fair value of the portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks inherent in these securities 
however  we do attempt to reduce these risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than nine months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
in addition  we believe that we currently have the ability to hold these investments until maturity  and therefore  believe that reductions in the value of these securities attributable to short term fluctuations in interest rates would not materially harm our business 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries in the united kingdom and germany 
although we transact business with various countries  settlement amounts are usually based on united states currency 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past and we do not presently engage in hedging activity 
based on the intercompany balances of million with the united kingdom and million with germany at june   a hypothetical adverse change in sterling or euro against united states dollars would not result in a material foreign exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such intercompany balances  or of other accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  would have a direct material impact on our business 
notwithstanding the foregoing analysis of the direct effects of interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  the indirect effects of such fluctuations could have a materially harmful effect on our business 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the united states  foreign and global economies which could materially harm our business
