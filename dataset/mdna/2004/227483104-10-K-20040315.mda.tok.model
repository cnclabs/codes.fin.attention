item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial and other data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare staffing services in the united states 
as of the fourth quarter of  our healthcare staffing business segment represented approximately of our current revenue and is comprised of travel nurse and allied health staffing  per diem nurse staffing and clinical research trials staffing 
approximately of our revenue was derived from travel nurse staffing services 
our other staffing services include the placement of allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists  and the placement of clinical research professionals 
our other human capital management services business segment  which represented approximately of our revenues  consists of education and training  healthcare consulting and physician search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue and net income as shown on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations were million and million  respectively 
history in july  an affiliate of charterhouse group international  inc and certain members of management acquired the assets of cross country staffing  our predecessor  from w 
r 
grace co 
upon the closing of this transaction  we changed from a partnership to a c corporation form of ownership 
in december  we acquired travcorps corporation travcorps  which was owned by investment funds managed by morgan stanley private equity and certain members of travcorps management and subsequently changed our name to cross country travcorps  inc subsequent acquisitions and dispositions were made as discussed below 
in may  we changed our name to cross country  inc subsequently  in may  we changed our name to cross country healthcare  inc revenue our travel and per diem nurse staffing and allied healthcare staffing revenue is received primarily from acute care hospitals 
our clinical trials staffing revenue is received primarily from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as medical device companies 
revenue from allied health staffing services is received from numerous sources  including providers of radiation  rehabilitation and respiratory services at hospitals  nursing homes  sports medicine clinics and schools 
revenue from our search and recruitment  consulting and education and training services is received from numerous sources  including hospitals  physician group practices  insurance companies and individual healthcare professionals 
our fees are paid directly by our clients rather than by government or other third party payors 
revenue is recognized when services are rendered 
accordingly  accounts receivable includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet invoiced 
similarly  accrued compensation includes an accrual for employees time worked but not yet paid 
each of our field employees on travel assignment works for us under a contract 
these contracts typically last weeks 
payroll contract employees are hourly employees whose contract specifies the hourly rate they will be paid  including applicable overtime  and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the contract period 
for payroll contract employees  we bill clients at an hourly rate and assume all employee costs  including payroll  withholding taxes  benefits and professional liability insurance and occupational safety and health administration  or osha  requirements  as well as any travel and housing arrangements 
mobile contract employees are hourly employees of the hospital client and receive an agreement that specifies the hourly rates they will be paid by the hospital employer  as well as any benefits they are entitled to receive from us 
for mobile contract employees  we provide recruitment  housing in apartments leased by us and travel reimbursement 
our contract with the healthcare professional obligates us to provide these services to the healthcare professional 
we are compensated for the services we provide at a predetermined rate negotiated with our hospital client  without regard to our cost of providing these services 
currently  approximately of our employees work under payroll contracts 
our healthcare staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of and demand for nurses at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare personnel who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare personnel could limit our ability to fill open assignments and grow our revenue and net income 
recently  as a result of decreased demand discussed below  we experienced a decrease in the rate at which our field staff renew their contracts with us 
we believe this is partially due to a decline in the amount and diversity of opportunities we can present to them  along with a drop in facilities willingness to continue to employ our nurses in consecutive contracts 
some travelers have decided to stop traveling to take full time or part time positions  even though it may not be their first choice 
although the number of open positions has recently increased  we believe it may take some time before nurses and other healthcare professionals get more comfortable in our ability to employ them consistently in a location that they desire 
the relative demand for our services at clients facilities may also affect the profitability of our business 
since the later part of  many hospitals have taken nurse staffing actions that have decreased demand  which we believe has temporarily contracted our revenue 
we believe these decisions have resulted in increased reliance on staff nurse overtime  increased patient to nurse ratios and high wage and compensation increases  including sign on bonuses  by the hospitals 
we also believe that  due to present economic conditions  where many nurse s spouses have been laid off and severance and unemployment benefits have ended  many part time nurses employed directly by hospitals who would have typically worked two shifts or less per week have increased the number of shifts worked at their hospitals and are doing so at the prevailing hospital wage 
other factors that affect the demand for our services are patient occupancy rates 
as occupancy increases  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as occupancy decreases  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
additionally  we may experience more competitive pricing pressure during these periods of decreased demand 
acquisitions on june   we acquired the assets of med staff  for million in cash  net of a post closing working capital adjustment  plus an earnout provision up to a maximum of million based on performance 
med staff did not qualify to receive any earn out payments 
med staff is headquartered in newtown square  pennsylvania  and is a national provider of travel and per diem healthcare professionals that operates across a wide geographic and client base in all states 
the acquisition has been included in the healthcare staffing segment and the results of med staff s operations have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
the purchase price has been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of fair value at the date of acquisition 
other identifiable intangible assets were valued at million  of which million was assigned to hospital relations and million was assigned to non compete agreements  based on a third party appraisal 
these identifiable intangible assets have been assigned useful lives with a weighted average range of years 
approximately million has been recorded to goodwill as the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
additional direct acquisition costs of million are included as goodwill as of december  goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes over a year life 
the initial purchase price allocation is based on preliminary information that could be changed based on the ultimate resolution of initial assessments 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility consisting of a million term loan with staggered maturities through june  and a five year million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from the term loan  along with cash on hand of million  were used to finance the purchase of med staff  to repay the term loan balance on the prior credit facility  and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the financing

discontinued operations in march  we committed to a formal plan to dispose of our subsidiary  e staff  through a sale of this business 
e staff was previously included in our other human capital management services segment 
e staff was an application service provider that had developed an internet subscription based communication  scheduling  credentialing and training service business for healthcare providers 
as an application service provider  e staff maintained a database of the client s employees on e staff s servers 
however  prospective e staff clients were concerned about placing their health care employees names and credentials on servers owned or controlled by one of the nation s largest healthcare staffing companies 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the discontinuance of e staff 
the costs and expenses  assets and liabilities of e staff have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
during the first quarter of we abandoned our efforts to sell the e staff business and decided to dispose of the subsidiary by winding down its operations 
e staff operations ceased as of march  at that time  we determined that approximately million of the net carrying amount of the assets from discontinued operations was impaired 
this impairment charge was taken as a loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december  in december  we committed to a formal plan to divest hospitalhub  inc  or hospitalhub  our electronic job board business  which began operations in the operating results of hospitalhub have been accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and in the other financial information included herein 
we completed the divestiture of hospitalhub in the second quarter of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets from the acquisition of the assets of our predecessor  cross country staffing  a partnership  as well as from subsequent acquisitions were million and million  at december  we adopted the provisions of fasb no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  accordingly  goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
instead  we review impairment annually 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years

the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of med staff on june   partially offset by a decrease in revenue from other healthcare staffing businesses 
excluding the effects of this acquisition and the acquisition of jrk in march  revenue for the year ended december  decreased from the year ended december  see segment information 
direct operating expenses are comprised primarily of field employee compensation expenses  housing expenses  travel expenses and field insurance expenses 
direct operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  direct operating expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to a higher mix of healthcare staffing businesses  which operate at higher direct cost structures than our other human capital management services as well as higher housing and insurance costs in our healthcare staffing segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased expenses in our healthcare staffing business related to the acquisition of med staff  and to the expansion of our sales and marketing activities to support our strategy of pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital customers 
bad debt expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  bad debt expense represented of revenue for the year ended december  compared with less than for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts to cover the increased aging on certain accounts

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this was due to the implementation of system enhancements and the additional amortization from certain specifically identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of med staff 
non recurring secondary offering costs were million  for the year ended december  these costs are all related to expenses incurred as a result of our secondary offering in march we did not receive any proceeds from this offering and  accordingly  did not capitalize any of the associated costs 
net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily related to higher average borrowings resulting from the financing for the acquisition of med staff 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the effective interest rate due mainly to the expiration of our interest rate swap agreement in february the effective interest rate for the year ended december  was compared to during the year ended december  income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the years ended december  and losses from discontinued operations  net of income tax benefits  for the years ended december  and december   were million and million  respectively

bad debt expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  bad debt expense represented less than of revenue for compared with for this decrease was due to improved collections coupled with a decrease in write offs 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization expense declined to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in amortization of intangibles as a result of the adoption of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in january and the write off of million of debt issuance costs in october as a result of our initial public offering 
fasb statement no 
promulgates that goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives should not be amortized 
instead  goodwill and certain intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment 
no impairment charges were necessary as of december  non recurring secondary offering costs for the year ended december  were million  all relating to expenses incurred as a result of our secondary offering in march we did not receive any proceeds from this offering and  accordingly  did not capitalize any of the associated costs 
loss on early extinguishment of debt totaled million for the year ended december  this amount represents the write off of million in loan fees due to the repayment of million of debt and a prepayment penalty of million on the early termination of million of subordinated debt  less applicable taxes 
the debt was repaid with proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock in october net interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in was primarily due to the repayment of approximately million of debt with the proceeds received from our initial public offering of common stock in october income tax expense for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the tax rate has been impacted by our adoption of fasb statement no

 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  healthcare staffing revenue from our healthcare staffing segment for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of med staff on june  along with increases in revenue from our developmental centralized per diem and international recruitment businesses 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in our other healthcare staffing businesses 
including med staff  the number of ftes increased over the prior year 
excluding the effects of the med staff acquisition  revenue decreased  million or  from revenue 
this decrease was due to a decrease in the average number of ftes  representing million  an increase in the percentage of ftes working under mobile contracts  representing million  partially offset by an increase in the average hourly bill rate  contributing million 
the average number of ftes on contract  excluding the ftes from the med staff acquisition  decreased 
this decline in ftes was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel nurse staffing operations and clinical research trials business  partially offset by higher ftes in our centralized per diem and international recruitment businesses 
demand for our travel nurse staffing operations continued to decrease during due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers and full time and part time nurses offering more hours of service directly to hospital employers 
we believe this trend may continue in the short term and is primarily due to current economic conditions that enable hospitals to meet more of their nurse staffing needs internally at prevailing wages 
although we are encouraged there may be a change in direction in this dynamic based on the number of orders for contract nurses we have been receiving  we have not experienced sustained increases in contract booking activity 
we believe it may take some time to change the behaviors of our hospital clients and nurses 
we believe that demand for outsourced travel nursing services will increase in the long term  driven by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll accounted for of our volume in our core travel nursing operations in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  although revenue from our developmental centralized per diem and international recruitment businesses increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the increase was partially offset by lower revenue in our clinical research trials staffing business for the same periods 
while improving sequentially during the second half of  ftes from our clinical research trials business decreased on a year over year basis  due to a decrease in demand for clinical research professionals since the beginning of for the year ended december   of our healthcare staffing revenue was generated by nurse staffing operations and was generated by other operations 
for the year ended december   of our healthcare staffing revenue was generated by nurse staffing operations and was generated by other operations 
contribution income from our healthcare staffing segment for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  contribution income was impacted by relatively higher housing and insurance costs and less leverage on overhead  partially offset by the contribution from the med staff acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  other human capital management services revenue from our other human capital management services segment for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue in included jrk from its march st acquisition 
excluding the effects of this acquisition on both periods  revenue in the year ended december  decreased million  or  as compared with the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our search and consulting businesses partially offset by an increase in revenues from our educational seminars business 
during  there was a reduction in demand for our physician search and consulting businesses 
revenue from the educational seminars business increased due to an increase in the number of seminars conducted partially offset by a lower number of attendees and average price per seminar 
contribution income from other human capital management services was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in contribution income was primarily due to the same factors that impacted revenue coupled with higher operating expenses in our consulting and educational seminars businesses 
unallocated corporate overhead unallocated corporate overhead was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of employee benefits  higher legal fees  certain organizational costs related to the acquisition of med staff and higher insurance costs 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  unallocated corporate overhead was for the year ended december  compared to in the prior year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  healthcare staffing revenue from our healthcare staffing segment for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from novapro  acquired in january  and a full year s revenue  rather than months of revenue from clinforce in acquired on march  was included in the results for the year ended december  excluding the effects of these acquisitions  revenue increased  million or  as compared with the revenue for the year ended december  the increase was mainly attributable to a higher average hourly bill rate in all businesses and an increase in the numbers of field employees in our nurse staffing and allied health staffing businesses  offset in part by a modest reduction in the hours billed per fte per week 
the average number of hours worked per week per fte continued to decrease in primarily as a result of an increase in the number of nurses working three hour shifts rather than five hour shifts 
for the year ended december   of our healthcare staffing revenue was generated by nurse staffing operations and was generated by other operations 
for the year ended december   of our healthcare staffing revenue was generated by nurse staffing operations and was generated by other operations 
other human capital management services revenue from our other human capital management services segment for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue in included jrk  which was acquired on march   and three additional months of gill balsano  which was acquired on april  excluding the effects of these acquisitions  revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared with the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in revenues from our educational seminars business 
revenue from the educational seminars business increased due to an increase in number of seminars conducted and the number of attendees  partially offset by a lower average price per seminar 
unallocated corporate overhead unallocated corporate overhead for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of consolidated revenue unallocated corporate overhead was in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a current ratio  defined as the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital increased by million to million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in the short term portion of debt  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accounts payable 
part of the increase in accounts receivable was related to acquisitions 
excluding acquisitions  accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased million in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to lower revenue 
including acquisitions  days sales outstanding increased days to days at december  compared to days at december  this reflects  in part  a relative increase of business more toward the northeast where we tend to have a greater concentration of slower paying accounts 
our operating cash flows constitute our primary source of liquidity  and historically  have been sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service 
we believe that our capital resources are sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months 
we expect to meet our future needs for working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion  debt service  and any additional stock repurchases from a combination of operating cash flows and funds available under our credit facility 
we also continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that may require additional funding

critical accounting principles and estimates in response to the securities and exchange commission s release number cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and number commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  through december   goodwill and other intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and performed a transitional impairment analysis as of january   to assess the recoverability of these intangibles  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and based on the results of these tests  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  or december  or january  the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash flows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets from discontinued operations to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
during the year ended december   an impairment charge of approximately million net of income tax benefit of million  was taken on the net assets of e staff and is included in our consolidated statement of operations as loss from discontinued operations 
at december   fair value was based on the latest offer received for the sale of e staff at that time and included the estimated cash flows from the sale to a potential buyer  adjusted for the estimated probability of the sale 
in  when we determined that we would wind down operations of the business without a buyer  a further impairment of million was recognized and included in the loss from discontinued operations 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued employee compensation and benefits in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued eitf  accounting for claims made insurance and retroactive insurance contracts  which codified previously issued authoritative accounting guidance in the area of insurance contracts and related activity thereto 
we had previously offset in our consolidated balance sheets our liability for known and incurred but not reported professional liability and workers compensation losses with a corresponding receivable for such estimated losses from our commercial insurance companies under policies in effect for such periods 
such prior accounting treatment was pursuant to industry practice under the interpretative guidance under the american institute of certified public accountants audit and accounting guide for health care organizations 
eitf no 
concluded that  under circumstances such as in our insured professional liability and workers compensation policies  since a right of legal offset does not exist due to the fact that there are three parties to an incurred claim the insured  the insurer and the claimant  the related liability should be classified separately on a gross basis with a separate related receivable recognized as being due from insurance carriers 
accordingly  our consolidated balance sheet as of december   reflects the provisions of eitf for the receivable portion in other current assets and for the related liability in accrued employee compensation and benefits 
the corresponding liability and receivable as of december  has also been reclassified in our consolidated balance sheet 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin no 
also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities in the first fiscal year beginning after june  we do not have any interests qualifying as a variable interest entity as of december  as a result  fin no 
will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 rescission of statements   and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and an amendment of that statement  fasb statement no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements

 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in opinion for classification as an extraordinary item should be reclassified 
we adopted the provisions of this statement as of january  accordingly  the loss on early extinguishment of debt in was included in the other expenses section of the consolidated statement of operations and the loss on early extinguishment of debt in was reclassified from an extraordinary item to the other expenses section in the consolidated statements of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fasb statement no 
requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
under fasb statement no 
 an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
fasb statement no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
in the december  consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of fasb no 
did not have an effect on our financial position  but may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future exit and disposal activities 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
historically  we have been able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes  primarily as a result of our credit facility  which bears interest based on floating rates 
we were party to an interest rate swap agreement  which fixed the interest rate paid on million of borrowings under our credit facility at plus the applicable margin 
the last swap payment was made in february prior to january  we accounted for the swap agreement as a hedge  which means changes in the fair value of the swap were not required to be recognized in earnings 
effective january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
upon adopting fasb statement no 
 we recorded a liability for the fair value of the swap  which reduced consolidated stockholders equity by million 
we recognized changes in the fair value of the swap in earnings to the extent such changes were greater or less than the corresponding change in the fair value of the future variable interest payments on the portion of the debt underlying the swap 
during the year ended december   other comprehensive income increased by million as a result of this interest rate swap 
the fair value of our interest rate swap at december  was million and is separately stated in our consolidated balance sheets 
a change in interest rates on variable rate debt would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately million in  million for and million for
