item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  our results of operations were negatively affected by the continuing weakness of the global economy 
average selling prices declined significantly  especially during the first half of  and technology spending by corporations worldwide continued to be limited 
towards the end of and continuing into the first quarter of  we have recognized signs that the global economy is improving  especially in the us japan also ended with strong economic indicators 
capital investment  especially in the information technology sector  is expected to improve in both the us and europe in as companies replace aging technology infrastructures 
we believe a better economic climate will stimulate continued investment in our industry leading to an aggressively competitive environment during industry analysts are forecasting strong unit growth in  as well as some easing in the pricing environment 
however  we are anticipating and planning for the continuation of strong price competition in unit growth may be limited  especially in the first half of  by a constrained supply of key components such as lamps  lenses and display devices 
sony has decided to use all of its production for internal purposes  which leaves only one polysilicon supplier and one dlp supplier to serve the needs of the entire industry 
in addition  increasing demand for micro display rear projection televisions and digital cameras is causing lamp and lens vendors to place certain components on allocation and or lengthen lead times until additional capacity becomes available 
we will continue to focus on revenue growth in through demand generation programs as well as through continuing product innovations 
we see both the professional and home markets for digital front projection as critical to our growth strategy 
in addition  adding complementary products such as a family of large format thin profile displays and light engines for rear projection televisions will also help drive revenue growth while leveraging our existing infrastructure 
the difficult economic climate and competitive landscape resulted in reduced revenues and lower gross margins during these factors prompted us to initiate several cost saving initiatives designed to reduce our expense infrastructure and allow us to return to profitability while realizing lower gross margin levels 
we finished with two consecutive quarters of improving gross margins  reduced operating expenses  and lower operating losses 
our current targets are to return to profitability in the first half of and improve gross margins to between and

revenues the revenue decrease in compared to is primarily attributable to an over decrease in average selling prices asps compared to a decline in compared to the decrease in asps slowed in the third and fourth quarters of to and  respectively  compared to their immediately preceding quarters 
the first and second quarters of experienced asp decreases of greater than from their immediately preceding quarters 
the decrease in asps in both years is due to the following continued softness in business technology spending  a weaker economy  and geopolitical concerns  aggressive price competition in the industry due to an industry oversupply situation  a mix shift to our value priced products due to the emergence of a new end user price point category in mid  and the addition of competition from new competitors including taiwanese and chinese manufacturers 
the decreases in asps during and were partially offset by increases in units sold of approximately and  respectively 
the increase in units sold in was primarily in the lower margin  entry level value priced svga products due to the emergence of the new end user price point category 
unit sales in were also positively affected by a  unit order for the malaysian educational system in the fourth quarter 
in addition  we added circuit city and sam s club to our retail customers in the fourth quarter of causing unit growth in the emerging retail channel 
our retail customers also include best buy  office depot  staples  compusa and magnolia audio video 
geographic revenues revenue by geographic area and as a percentage of total revenue was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  united states europe asia other revenue declines in the corporate sector in the u 
s in compared to were partially offset by increases in government and education sales 
the revenue decrease in europe in compared to reflects the overall economic weakness in the region  particularly in germany 
the revenue increase in asia in compared to reflects the large malaysian educational revenue that more than offset the impact of sars during the first half of and being unable to sell into the chinese market since the middle of the second quarter of excluding the impact of china from the asia revenue figures  asia revenues increased approximately in compared to backlog at december   we had backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  given current supply and demand estimates  it is anticipated that a majority of the current backlog will turn over by the end of the first quarter of the stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that we will realize a profit from filling the orders 
gross margin the decrease in gross margin in compared to and is due to the following average selling prices declining faster than we could reduce our material costs  a mix shift to value priced svga products  fixed manufacturing costs spread over lower revenue  higher warranty costs  million of write downs of inventory during compared to million in and million in the inventory write downs in all years resulted from the following lower projected usage rates for customer service parts over the remaining service life of the products as price points for new projectors continued to decline  remaining raw materials that will not be transitioned to our contract manufacturing partners  the decision to end the life of a number of products as we transitioned our product line to newer products  engineering change orders  lower of cost or market write downs on certain finished goods including remanufactured projectors  lower of cost or market write downs on our inventory that is being held by chinese authorities  and the write off of certain raw materials and capitalized tooling costs associated with a lower end rear projection engine project for one of our asian customers that we decided not to pursue 
the increase in warranty expense in compared to was primarily related to an increasing installed base of projectors and the increasing cost of repairing projectors through authorized service providers 
the increase as a percentage of revenues relates to decreasing asps  while the average cost to repair a unit has not decreased as rapidly 
the increase in warranty expense in compared to was due primarily to higher warranty activity experienced on certain products for specifically identified design or manufacturing issues 
we are focusing on reducing our warranty costs per unit shipped by focusing on improved product quality through design and manufacturing process improvements  outsourcing of our factory repair activities  and implementing changes to our warranty programs and administration processes 
in the second quarter of  we completed the process of shifting our production offshore to our contract manufacturers  flextronics and funai  which currently manufacture of our projectors 
flextronics and funai will be directly sourcing a majority of the components with their asian suppliers to further reduce our product costs 
in an effort to reduce our freight costs  we intend to continue shipping a portion of the finished goods from flextronics and funai via ocean carriers rather than by air 
now that we have completed the migration of our manufacturing offshore  we are focusing on reducing costs associated with our logistics and factory repair activity through outsourcing 
we have selected ups supply chain solutions as our global provider for these services 
we began the transition to ups in europe at the end of the third quarter of and we transitioned our domestic operation to ups early in the first quarter of with asia expected to follow later in the year 
leveraging ups efficiencies  we expect to further reduce our cost structure while at the same time improve customer service and response times 
while we expect gross margins to improve to the to range in the first half of  we expect continued pressure due to continued aggressive pricing behavior in the market and continued growth of the value priced svga segment of the market 
we anticipate that these pressures will be partially offset by the following expected reductions in the cost of our products  a refreshed product line as we enter  continued reductions in our overhead with the completion of our transition to offshore manufacturing  reductions in logistics costs upon the completion of outsourcing our logistics and factory repair activities to a global provider  decreased facilities costs as we exit our leased logistics and factory repair sites facilities  and decreased depreciation expense following the sfas no 
impairment charge taken in the third quarter of  as further discussed below 
marketing and sales expense the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to was primarily due to decreased marketing incentives paid to customers as a result of lower revenues  lower employee related costs due to our restructuring efforts and savings realized from the streamlining of our channel structure 
these decreases were offset in part by costs related to our efforts to generate end user demand and to launch several new products during we expect to continue to reinvest savings from other areas of the business in demand generation and other revenue enhancing programs in  which we expect to result in a small increase in total sales and marketing expense for the year 
the decrease in marketing and sales expense in compared to was primarily a result of lower marketing incentives paid to customers as a result of the lower revenues  lower employee related costs due to our restructuring actions in and and savings realized from the streamlining of our channel structure 
research and development expense research and development expenditures in primarily related to the development of new products  our networking and wireless initiatives and our initiative to design and produce rear projection engines for large screen digital televisions and ultra thin digital display 
in our research and development efforts will continue to be focused on new and improved products  including ultra thin large displays for the home and commercial use as well as new front projector products for all segments of the market 
we expect that the amount spent on research and development expense in will decrease as we expand and accelerate our co development efforts with our manufacturing partners 
we also expect research and development expense to decline in as a result of decreased depreciation expense following the long lived asset impairment charge taken in the third quarter of research and development expenditures in primarily related to the development of new products  including several platforms launched at flextronics during the year  as well as our home entertainment  networking  and wireless initiatives 
our research and development spending in also reflected our initiative to design and produce rear projection engines for large screen digital televisions 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in includes charges for bad debts of million caused by deterioration in certain customers financial condition as a result of the ongoing weak economic conditions in various markets around the world  compared to million of bad debt expense in in addition  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to due to lower expenses associated with the implementation of oracle in and headcount reductions and other efficiencies related to our restructuring activities in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in legal and consulting fees of approximately million in compared to due to our current situation in china 
excluding the impact of bad debts  we expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to decline in as a result of decreased depreciation expense following the long lived asset impairment charge taken in the third quarter of in addition to the million of bad debt expense included in general and administrative expense in discussed above  general and administrative expense increased in compared to due to charges related to the implementation of our oracle i accounting system in the us and europe 
restructuring restructuring charges of million in were primarily for the following lease loss costs associated with consolidating our research and development facility in wilsonville  oregon into our headquarters building  costs associated with transitioning our logistics and factory repair activities to ups  costs associated with various management changes  streamlining our management  administrative and support functions worldwide  and leveraging our research and development investment through co development 
we expect to incur an additional million and million  respectively  in the first and second quarters of to complete these transitions  primarily related to further consolidation and outsourcing of space requirements 
current restructuring accounting rules only allow the recognition of facilities related restructuring charges once the affected space has been vacated 
we anticipate that the net annualized benefit related to restructuring activities incurred in q and the first half of is approximately million in restructuring charges of million in were primarily for employee severance costs and costs related to the abandonment of leased space 
leased space was abandoned in connection with the migration of additional production offshore and the streamlining of our sales and marketing activities 
it also included charges for streamlining our european operations by centralizing our financial operations and our service and support functions 
restructuring charges of million in represented costs incurred with the consolidation of our global supply chain  including distribution  logistics and service operations  which were directly related to our business combination with proxima asa in june the charges also represented costs for streamlining our us sales and marketing organization and increasing our manufacturing outsourcing initiative with flextronics 
at december   we have a remaining accrual for all of our past restructuring activities of million 
see further detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived asset impairment based on significant quarterly operating losses during the first half of  we performed a review and evaluation of the carrying value of our long lived assets for impairment during the third quarter of pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we performed an expected present value analysis with multiple cash flow scenarios  weighted by estimated probabilities  using a risk free interest rate to estimate fair value 
this analysis  along with under utilization of certain assets  indicated that the book value of certain of our long lived assets exceeded the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of  which was allocated  on a pro rata basis  to the long lived assets 
all of the long lived assets are continuing to be used in operations 
as a result of this impairment charge  we expect to realize reductions in depreciation expense through the end of we expect our quarterly depreciation expense to decrease by approximately million through mid  with this reduction decreasing each quarter as assets become fully depreciated 
of this quarterly decrease  approximately is expected to reduce cost of revenues and approximately is expected to reduce operating expenses 
goodwill goodwill amortization ceased in the first quarter of upon adoption of sfas no 
on january  however  in accordance with sfas no 
 we tested our goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of the market value of our common stock declined below its book value during  and remained below book value as of december  under sfas no 
 these facts indicated the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded a goodwill charge of million in the fourth quarter of and as of and since december   we do not have any goodwill remaining on our balance sheet 
other income expense interest income decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily the result of lower overall interest rates and shorter average maturities in other income of  in primarily includes income from our motif joint venture and foreign currency gains offset by a write down of million related to certain cost based investments in technology companies 
other expense of million in includes a million loss on foreign currency transactions and a write down of million related to certain cost based investments in technology companies 
other income of  in includes a gain on sale of marketable equity securities of million and foreign currency transaction gains of million  offset by a charge of million for the write down of certain investments in technology companies 
income taxes income tax expense of million in relates to income tax expense on profits in certain foreign tax jurisdictions for  as well as an increase to our valuation allowance for foreign deferred tax assets due to larger than anticipated operating losses in another foreign tax jurisdiction 
the net income tax provision of million in includes a carry back benefit for our operating loss  offset by a million charge to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the us at december  in accordance with sfas no 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more details concerning our income tax provision 
inflation we believe that the impact of inflation was minimal on our business in  and liquidity and capital resources total cash  marketable securities and restricted cash were million at december  at december   we had working capital of million  which included million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  million of short term marketable securities  and million of cash and inventory held in china 
the current ratio at december  and december  was to and to  respectively 
we anticipate that our current cash and marketable securities  along with cash anticipated to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
at december  we had one outstanding letter of credit totaling million  which expires august  this letter of credit collateralizes our obligations to a supplier for the purchase of finished goods inventory 
the fair value of this letter of credit approximates its contract value 
the letter of credit is collateralized by million of cash and marketable securities  and  as such  is reported as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
accounts receivable were positively affected in by strong cash collections 
days sales outstanding were days at december  compared to days at december  inventories decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the components of inventory as of these dates 
included in the december  inventory balance is million of inventory that is being held by chinese authorities in connection with their investigation of our import duties 
in the first quarter of  chinese authorities released another million of inventory 
the release of the remaining inventory is dependent on case resolution 
decreases in inventory resulted from reductions in raw materials as a result of outsourced manufacturing  increases in inventory reserves and strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of at december   we had approximately three weeks of inventory in the channel compared to approximately seven weeks at december  annualized inventory turns were approximately eight times for the quarter ended december  and five times for the quarter ended december  income taxes receivable decreased million to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to the receipt of million from the irs in the third quarter of and million received in the fourth quarter of related to the carry back of our taxable losses in the us the remaining tax refunds associated with our carry back claims are anticipated to be received during as the irs and other tax jurisdictions complete the processing of our refund claims 
outsourced manufacturer receivables decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  due to the transitioning of our production to contract manufacturing by the end of the second quarter of we expect this balance to continue to decline during the first quarter of other current assets decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  other current assets at december  include our million deposit with the chinese authorities in connection with their investigation of our import duties 
accounts payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily due to decreasing inventory purchases due to lower overall inventory balances and the timing of payments to our suppliers 
marketing incentives payable decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  due to a decrease in marketing incentives as a result of decreased sales in compared to and the realignment of marketing programs to better match our product and program offerings in each channel to improve the effectiveness of our marketing expenses 
property  plant and equipment decreased million in to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to a million write down of certain assets related to the sfas no 
impairment charge taken in the third quarter of and normal depreciation of assets during  offset in part by total purchases of million 
expenditures for property and equipment in primarily included purchases of product tooling  information systems infrastructure software  primarily for the oracle i european implementation  and engineering design and test equipment 
total expenditures for property and equipment are expected to be between and million in  primarily for product tooling and routine information technology upgrades 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands contractual obligation payments due by period total and and and beyond letters of credit purchase order commitments capital commitments operating leases seasonality given the buying patterns of various geographies and market segments  our revenues are subject to certain elements of seasonality during various portions of the year 
historically  to of our revenue has come from europe and  as such  we typically experience a seasonal downturn due to the vacation season in mid summer  which results in our revenues from that region  and overall  to be down in the third quarter compared to the second quarter 
conversely  we typically experience a strong resurgence of revenue from europe in the fourth quarter 
this  coupled with a strong buying season in the fourth quarter by larger wholesale distribution partners and retailers  typically leads to our strongest revenues being in the fourth quarter of each year 
in addition  we sell our products into the education and government markets that typically see seasonal peaks in the third quarter of each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for uncollectible trade accounts receivables credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer to initiate and modify their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
in certain situations  if an account is determined to be a bad debt we may also use collection agencies to work with the customer for payment for a fee 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could materially change 
at december  and  our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets 
bad debt expense totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and allowance for sales returns and other deductions from revenue some distributor and dealer agreements allow for partial return of products and or price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
such return rights are generally limited to a contractually defined short term stock rotation and defective or damaged product 
we maintain a reserve for sales returns and price adjustments based on historical experience and other qualitative factors 
we also have incentive programs for dealers and distributors whereby rebates are offered based upon exceeding a percentage of quarterly and annual volume goals 
estimated sales returns  price protection and rebates are deducted from revenue 
historical return rates are monitored monthly on a product by product basis 
as new products are introduced  these historical rates are used to establish initial sales returns reserves and are adjusted as better information becomes available 
we also regularly monitor and track channel inventory with our significant customers 
variability in channel inventory levels from quarter to quarter are further used to qualitatively adjust our returns reserves 
typically  most returns occur within days of shipment and return rates have averaged in a relatively tight range of percent to percent of sales to customers who are granted such rights 
if a dramatic change in the rate of returns were to occur  our estimate of our sales return accrual could change significantly 
one of the factors we consider in estimating future returns  for the customers who are granted such rights  is the sell through of products by our distributors and dealers 
we have controls in place to monitor channel inventory levels with these customers 
we believe the risk of returns increases when inventory held by any particular customer exceeds their near term needs 
accordingly  we defer recognition of revenue on certain channel inventory estimated to be in excess of days 
our net reserve for sales returns  price protection and other rebates totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and historically  our actual experience for sales returns  price protection and rebates has not differed materially from our estimates 
inventory valuation we regularly evaluate the realizability of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions  as well as other factors 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
raw materials and work in progress with quantities in excess of forecasted usage are reviewed at least quarterly by our engineering  operating  and finance personnel for obsolescence 
such raw material and work in progress write downs are typically caused by engineering change orders or product end of life adjustments in the market 
finished goods are reviewed quarterly by product marketing  sales  finance  and operating personnel to determine if inventory carrying costs exceed market selling prices 
service inventory is systematically reserved for based on the estimated remaining service life of the inventory 
we record write downs for inventory based on the above factors and take into account worldwide quantities and demand in our analysis 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the realizability of inventory could materially change 
at december  and  our inventory valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively  and is recorded as a reduction of inventory on our consolidated balance sheets 
we recognized inventory write downs totaling million  million and million  respectively  in  and product warranties we evaluate our obligations related to product warranties on a quarterly basis 
in general  we offer a standard two year warranty and  for certain customers  products and regions the warranty period can be longer or shorter than two years 
we monitor failure rates on a product category basis through data collected by our manufacturing sites  factory repair centers and authorized service providers 
the service organizations also track costs to repair each unit 
costs include labor to repair the projector  replacement parts for defective items and freight costs  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
any cost recoveries from warranties offered to us by our suppliers covering defective components are also considered 
this data is then used to calculate the accrual based on actual sales for each projector category and remaining warranty periods 
for new product introductions  our quality control department estimates the initial failure rates based on test and manufacturing data and historical experience for similar platform projectors 
if circumstances change  or a dramatic change in the failure rates were to occur  our estimate of the warranty accrual could change significantly 
revenue generated from sales of extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized to revenue over the term of the extended warranty coverage 
deferred warranty revenue totaled million at both december  and and is included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
our warranty accrual at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and is included as accrued warranty and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million against deferred tax assets  which resulted in a net deferred tax asset balance of million and million  respectively 
long lived asset impairment long lived assets held and used by us and intangible assets with determinable lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
based on these reviews  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million in the third quarter of  which was allocated  on a pro rata basis  to the following categories of long lived assets  furniture and fixtures  manufacturing equipment  engineering equipment  computer software and equipment  building improvements  patents and trademarks 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this impairment charge 
new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements new accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
our net investment exposure in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  we have no plans of liquidating any of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not affect our results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates through the purchase of production materials and the sale of products denominated in non functional foreign currencies 
we have established a foreign currency derivative program  utilizing foreign currency forward contracts forward contracts to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are substantially offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
we do not use forward contracts as speculative instruments for trading purposes 
the effect of an immediate percent change in our foreign currency forward contracts would not have a material effect on our results of operations 
these forward contracts are not designated as qualifying hedges and  accordingly  are marked to market at the end of each period 
the table below summarizes  by major currency  the contractual amounts of our forward exchange contracts in us dollars as of december  the bought amounts represent the net us dollar equivalents of commitments to purchase foreign currencies  and the sold amounts represent the net us dollar equivalent of commitments to sell foreign currencies 
the foreign currency amounts have been translated into a us dollar equivalent value using the exchange rate at the reporting date 
forward contracts outstanding at december  mature in days or less as of december in thousands foreign currency bought sold euro british pound singapore dollar swedish krona norwegian kroner investment risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by diversifying investments among high credit quality securities in accordance with our investment policy 
as of december   our investment portfolio included marketable debt securities of million and marketable equity securities of million 
the debt securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
at december   the fair market value of our marketable debt securities totaled million 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
