item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mocon  inc designs  manufactures  markets  and services products and provides consulting services primarily in the measurement and analytical instrument and services markets 
our products include instruments that detect  measure and monitor gases and chemical compounds as well as products that prepare samples of various substances for laboratory analysis 
although some of the markets for our products are maturing  we continually seek growth opportunities through technological and product improvement  by acquiring and developing new products  and by acquiring new companies 
prior to  we expanded our business primarily through internally developing new products and technologies  acquiring product lines and technology  and licensing our products and technology 
in   and  we supplemented our internal growth through a total of four acquisitions that have provided us with additional technologies  products and product development expertise 
during we had four primary operating locations  all located in the united states 
sales decreased approximately in compared to  while net income decreased approximately for the same period 
our financial position as of december  reflects an increase in working capital of  to  compared to  at december  diluted earnings per share were in  in and in forward looking statements the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  except for the historical information  contains forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties 
these forward looking statements could differ materially from actual results 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or updates to these forward looking statements to reflect future events or unanticipated occurrences 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are considered critical to the consolidated financial statements because they require subjective and complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible 
the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis includes the age of the receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsened for our customers 
inventory obsolescence analysis we perform an analysis to identify inventory shrinkage  slow moving  and obsolete inventory 
we record a charge to cost of sales for amounts identified 
our analysis includes inventory levels  physical inventory counts  cycle count adjustments  the nature of the finished product and its inherent risk of obsolescence  the gross margin of the product  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history of that finished product 
we believe that the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions 
recoverability of long lived assets we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that expected future undiscounted cash flows might not be sufficient to support the carrying amount of an asset 
we deem an asset to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows is less than an asset s carrying amount 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
changes in our business strategies and or changes in the economic environment in which we operate may result in future impairment charges 
results of operations the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of sales  for fiscal years  and the company s historical financial data were derived from its audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
percent of sales sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income investment income income before income taxes income taxes net income the following table sets forth the relationship between various components of domestic and foreign sales  stated as a percent of total sales  for fiscal years  and percent of sales domestic sales foreign sales japan western europe canada other total foreign sales total sales net sales sales were  in  compared to  in and  in the decrease in sales from to was primarily the result of decreases in the domestic sales volume of our sample preparation products  domestic and foreign sales volume of our gas analyzer products  domestic sales volume of our gas chromatography analyzer products and foreign sales volume of our leak detection products  offset by increases in the foreign sales volume of our permeation products and domestic and foreign sales volume of our weighing products 
the impact of price increases was not significant 
the increase in sales from to was primarily the result of baseline sales in totaling  baseline was acquired in october   and therefore our results included sales of baseline from the effective date of acquisition  or  increases in the domestic sales volume of our sample preparation products  domestic sales volume of our permeation products  and the foreign sales volume of our leak detection products  offset by decreases in the foreign sales volume of our permeation products  domestic and foreign sales volume of our weighing products  and the foreign sales volume of our sample preparation products 
the impact of price increases was not significant 
we use a network of independent representatives to market and service our products in foreign countries  and expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
effective january   we acquired paul lippke handels gmbh prozess und laborsysteme lippke which is located in germany 
lippke has been the primary distributor of our products in europe for approximately thirty years  and also serves in the capacity of distributor or agent for several companies in addition to mocon 
this acquisition gives us a direct presence in europe 
the acquisition of lippke is expected to have a positive impact on sales in  particularly for revenues associated with our permeation products 
in  domestic sales decreased to  and foreign sales increased to  foreign sales were of total sales in  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of total sales in domestic sales were of total sales in  compared to  or in  and  or in permeation products permeation products accounted for approximately   and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
total sales of our permeation products increased in versus due primarily to increases in foreign sales  particularly in western europe  japan  and canada 
permeation sales decreased in compared to  primarily due to decreases in sales to japan and  to a lesser extent  western europe and canada  which we believe was primarily the result of slow economies in these major foreign markets 
weighing products weighing products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
weighing product sales increased in over due to an increase in the sales of our ab weighing systems  and to a lesser extent increases in the sales of our vericap systems 
the increase in sales of the ab systems was due in part to ab systems being sold in markets outside of the traditional pharmaceutical market 
weighing product sales decreased in versus due to declining sales of both our vericap and ab weighing systems 
we believe that the decline in sales of our vericap systems was due both to increased competition in high speed capsule weighing systems  and the slowness in the economy 
we believe that decreased sales of our ab weighing systems was due primarily to the slow economy 
sample preparation products sample preparation products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
sales of the sample preparation products sold by our lab connections  inc subsidiary decreased significantly in  primarily due to decreased sales in the life sciences and drug discovery markets 
sales increased in versus primarily due to sales of a new unit to one particular customer for use in the drug discovery and life sciences markets 
these sales were not repeated in as a result of the revenue shortfall in our sample preparation products  we have taken steps to consolidate the lab connections operations into our minneapolis  minnesota  and metro austin  texas  locations  and have closed the boston location effective february  this is expected to result in reduced operating costs in gas analyzer products sales of gas analysis and monitoring instrumentation products at our baseline mocon  inc subsidiary decreased in we believe that the decrease was primarily due to the slowness in the economy 
baseline sales for totaled  compared with  for  and  for the period from october  effective date of acquisition through december  in order to reduce operating costs and increase operating efficiencies  we are in the process of moving the majority of baseline s production to our minneapolis facility 
this transfer is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of gas chromatography analyzer products sales of gas chromatography components at our microanalytics instrumentation corp 
subsidiary accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
leak detection products sales of our leak detection products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
the decrease in versus was primarily due to foreign sales of our non destructive leak detector unit in not being repeated in sales of leak detection products increased in over due to an increase in sales of our non destructive leak detector in foreign markets 
headspace analyzer products headspace analyzer products accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
we believe sales of these products were up slightly in as compared to primarily due to the addition of new hand held headspace analyzer products 
consulting and analytical services consulting and analytical services cas sales accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated sales in   and  respectively 
because the majority of cas sales are to domestic customers  we believe that the primary cause for the decreases in these sales in and from was the slowdown in the domestic economy  which resulted in a reduced demand for our advanced testing services 
gross profit our gross profit margin was  and in each of the fiscal years ended december   and the gross profit margin is slightly higher than the prior year due to the product mix in including more permeation and weighing product sales  which on average carry a higher gross margin 
the gross profit margin percentage was slightly lower than due to the product mix in including baseline sales  which on average carry a lower gross margin percentage than our historical averages 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in were  or of sales  compared to  or of sales in  and  or of sales in the increase in sg a expenses from to is primarily due to an increase in tradeshow expense in an effort to increase future sales  offset somewhat by a decrease in commission expense associated with domestic sales 
the increase in sg a expenses from to is primarily due to a slight increase in commission and other selling expenses associated with the increase in sales  including baseline sales  partially offset by a decrease in goodwill amortization expense of  in versus as goodwill was no longer being amortized 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were  or approximately of sales in  compared to  or approximately of sales in  and  or approximately of sales in continued r d expenditures are necessary as we develop new products to expand in our niche markets 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to allocate on an annual basis approximately to of sales to research and development 
investment income investment income decreased to  in from  in and  in the decrease in is primarily due to lower average investment yields  offset by higher average investment balances  during the decrease in is due both to lower average investment balances and lower average investment yields during versus income tax expense the company s provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes in and and in and  respectively 
based on current operating conditions and income tax laws  we expect the tax rate for to be in the range of to 
net income net income was  in compared to  in  and  in diluted net income per share was 
per share in compared to 
per share in  and 
per share in liquidity and capital resources we continue to maintain a strong financial position 
total cash  temporary cash investments and marketable securities increased  during to  primarily due to net income for the period of  and a decrease in accounts receivable  offset somewhat by an increase in capital assets  dividend payments totaling  and repurchases of the company s common stock during totaling  our board of directors has authorized  depending upon market conditions and other factors  the repurchase of up to a total of  of our common stock at prices not exceeding the market price at the time of the purchase 
as of december    was remaining in this authorization 
the  decrease in accounts receivable in versus is primarily due to improved accounts receivable collection efforts  and a decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of inventory remained generally consistent in compared to in  we purchased  of property  plant and equipment  and  and  in and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements  capital expenditures and research and development costs 
cash flow from operations totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
we have no long term debt or material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  we do not believe that any major property  plant and equipment expenditures are required to accommodate the current level of operations 
we anticipate that a combination of our existing cash  temporary cash investments and marketable securities  plus an expected continuation of cash flow from operations  will continue to be adequate to fund operations  capital expenditures and dividend payments in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases  total contractual cash obligations  during the first quarter of  the company completed the acquisition of lippke and paid  excluding the future minimum earn out payments to be made in   and foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  and as a result we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements under which a company will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue was applicable for us for revenue arrangements entered into beginning in third quarter the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on revenue recognition 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january we will be required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on january  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
fin r did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for us  the statement was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise will be effective as of january   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for us on january  the effective date has been deferred indefinitely for certain other types of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
certain important factors if we experience any increase in the cost of raw materials or supplies  we may experience a decrease in profit margins 
in the past  the overall cost of the materials that we purchase has not risen much more than the rate of inflation  although the price of some of the components that we purchase has increased in the past several years due in part to our purchasing less of such components 
certain other material and labor costs have increased  but we believe that such increases are approximately consistent with overall inflation rates 
we believe that the price of our products and the prices of our competitors products is a significant factor affecting our customers buying decisions and consequently  we may not be able to pass along any cost increases in the form of price increases or sustain profit margins that we have achieved in prior years 
the markets in which we operate have experienced minimal growth in recent years  and our ability to increase our revenues will depend in part on our ability to develop new products  develop new applications for our existing products and to acquire complementary businesses and product lines 
the analytical and measurement instrument markets in which we operate have not shown significant growth in recent years 
although we have identified a number of strategies that we believe will allow us to grow our business and increase our sales  including developing new products and technologies  developing new applications for our technologies  acquiring complementary businesses and product lines  and strengthening our sales force  we can not assure you that we will be able to successfully implement these strategies  or that these strategies will result in the growth of our business or an increase in sales 
if we acquire businesses in the future  we may experience a decrease in our profit margins and our net income 
one of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth with the acquisition of businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing products 
some of the businesses that we previously acquired have produced net operating losses or low levels of profitability 
businesses that we may acquire in the future may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
we will likely have to successfully change the operations of any companies that we acquire in the future and improve the market penetration of such companies in order to achieve the level of profitability that we desire 
in addition  acquisitions that we believe will be beneficial to our business and financial results are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons  including the competition among prospective buyers 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions in the future and any acquisitions that we do complete may have an adverse effect on our financial performance and liquidity 
it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds either through public or private financing in order to finance any future acquisitions 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us and may dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders 
we face risks of technological changes that may render our products obsolete 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid and significant technological change and evolving industry standards 
as a result of such changes and evolving standards  our products may become noncompetitive or obsolete and we may have to develop new products in order to maintain or increase our revenues 
new product introductions that are responsive to these factors require significant planning  design  development and testing at the technological  product  and manufacturing process levels and we may not be able to timely develop new products 
in addition  industry acceptance of new technologies that we may develop may be slow to develop due to  among other things  existing regulations or standards written specifically for older technologies and general unfamiliarity of users with new technologies 
as a result  any new products that we may develop may not generate any meaningful revenues or profits for us for a number of years  if at all 
any reduction in the level of capital expenditures by our customers could negatively impact our sales 
our customers include pharmaceutical  food  medical  and chemical companies  laboratories  government agencies  and public and private research institutions 
the capital spending of these entities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
any decrease in capital spending by any of these customer groups could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a significant portion of our sales are generated from foreign countries and selling in foreign countries entails a number of risks which could result in a decrease to our sales or an increase in our operating expenses 
sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in and for approximately and of our revenues in and we expect that foreign sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
sales to customers in foreign countries are subject to a number of risks  including the following agreements may be difficult to enforce  receivables may difficult to collect  certain regions are experiencing political unrest and conflict  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles  the countries into which we sell may impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand  and export licenses  if required  may be difficult to obtain and the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce 
if any of these risks were to materialize  our sales into foreign countries could decline  or our operating costs could increase  which would adversely affect our financial results 
some of our competitors have greater resources than we do  which may provide our competitors with an advantage in the development and marketing of new products 
we currently encounter  and expect to continue to encounter  competition in the sale of our products 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include product quality and performance  price  reliability and customer service 
our competitors include large multinational corporations 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  competition could increase if new companies enter the market or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines 
our current products  products under development and our ability to discover new technologies may be insufficient to enable us to compete effectively with our competitors 
our reliance upon patents  domestic trademark laws and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from others who may sell similar products 
we hold patents relating to various aspects of our products and believe that proprietary technical know how is critical to many of our products 
proprietary rights relating to our products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
we can not be certain that we will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in the absence of patent protection  we may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
our competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents  or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe our patents 
we may incur substantial costs if our competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our patents or if we initiate any proceedings to protect our proprietary rights and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to us  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
there may also be pending or issued patents held by parties not affiliated with us that relate to our products or technologies and we may need to acquire licenses to any such patents to continue selling some or all of our products 
if we had to obtain any such license in order to be able to continue to sell some or all of our products  we may not be able to do so on terms that were favorable to us  if at all 
in addition  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our collaborators  employees  and consultants 
these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if we are required to account for stock options as a compensation expense  our net income and net income per common share will be reduced 
some companies have begun to account for stock options as compensation expense thus resulting in a reduction of their net income and net income per common share 
we currently grant all options at fair market value and do not record compensation expense in connection with the grants 
it is possible that future laws  regulations or changes in accounting standards will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as a compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
if such a change occurs  our net income and net income per common share will be reduced 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future and any broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past  and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future 
these factors include announcements of new products by us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  customer contract awards  developments in regulation  and general economic and political conditions in the various markets where our products are sold 
in addition  the stock prices of instrumentation companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
this market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our marketable securities are at fixed interest rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  virtually all of our marketable securities mature within two years 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holding of these financial instruments is minimal
