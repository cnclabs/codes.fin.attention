executive summary leveraging over twenty years of experience  we use our molecular technologies to develop products and deliver services for varied markets  some on a global basis 
since our research and commercial expertise and competencies are at the molecular level we can produce products and deliver services to many different types of industries 
our current revenues result primarily from the sale of enzyme products as ingredients or processing aids to the cleaning  textiles  sweeteners  fuel ethanol and food  feed and specialties markets  and from research funding  fees and royalties 
in  we expended million on our bioproducts research and development programs 
in addition to developing products for our current bioproduct markets  we are now involved in bioproduct research projects and programs that are directed toward providing new products and services in the emerging fields of biomaterials  biochemicals and nanotechnology 
furthermore  we expended million in on our health care programs 
we believe that this diversification of our research and development expenditures will increase the probability of achieving success in our commercial portfolio and result in increased value for our stockholders 
in  we achieved several accomplishments  including record product revenues  impressive growth in our bioproducts segment and improved financial performance 
in addition  we focused and advanced our health care segment 
we believe our financial strength and discipline allows us to be more selective in business collaborations  provides funds for business growth and provides a cushion against unfavorable financial events 
for the year ended december   total revenues increased by to million  compared to million in product revenues were million  compared to million for the same period in fees and royalty revenues were million in as compared to million in the prior year 
net income available to common stockholders was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share 
the results were impacted by restructuring and related charges of million  or million on an after tax basis 
without those charges  we would have reported net income available to common stockholders of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  for  we generated million in operating income and million in cash flow from operations 
we ended with million in cash  even after investing over million in research and development and paying down million on our senior notes over the past three years 
our bioproducts segment continued its steady growth in  setting company revenue records 
with the successful integration of the brewing and enzyme business of rhodia food uk limited  which was acquired at the end of  sales growth in was fueled largely by the food  feed and specialties markets 
we also experienced us dollar expansion in nearly all sectors 
driven primarily by the strength of the euro  the impact of foreign currency translation increased our product revenues by 
we currently manufacture our products at eight manufacturing facilities  which are located in the united states  finland  belgium  china and argentina 
we conduct our sales and marketing activities through our direct sales organizations in the united states  the netherlands  singapore  japan  china  united kingdom and argentina and through other distribution channels in selected markets and geographies 
in total  we derived approximately of our revenues from our foreign operations  while in and these revenues were approximately 
as discussed in item of this report  our bioproducts revenues were heavily influenced by activities with our major customers  particularly the procter gamble company 
in total  sales to our five largest customers represented approximately of our product revenues in with a focus on future growth in our bioproducts segment  we extended our long standing collaborative relationship with the procter gamble company for the continued creation of innovative new products primarily for the cleaning industry 
also  in the specialties market  our scientists  working closely with the hpa  continued development of a promising enzymatic process to inactivate prions  the causative agent for mad cow disease 
furthermore  in  the demand for fuel ethanol continued to grow  and we believe we are well positioned to provide innovative new products for this expanding market 
we also remain very encouraged by the progress being made in the emerging growth opportunities of our bioproducts segment  including personal care  biomaterials  silicon biotechnology  and biomass conversion 
as more completely discussed under the heading warehouse inventory loss in this item  we sustained damage to our finished bioproducts inventory in the second quarter of as a result of an accident in a third party warehouse in rotterdam  the netherlands 
however  we do not expect to sustain a net financial loss as a result of the accident 
in  our health care segment successfully achieved two key objectives  filing its first ind with the fda to enable phase i clinical testing of its hbv immunotherapeutic product candidate and completing construction of its cgmp facility in rochester  new york 
during the past year  we focused our health care research and development programs to further concentrate on the core competencies of protein engineering and targeting 
with the objective of creating a targeted biotherapeutics pipeline to address unmet medical needs  our heath care segment also continues to evaluate appropriate in licensing opportunities in development stage molecules that would supplement and complement its internal pipeline 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparation of those financial statements  we apply various accounting policies 
we also make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
although our accounting policies and certain estimates and assumptions are disclosed within the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following is a discussion of the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions we believe are most critical 
principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
investments in affiliates in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  are accounted for by the equity method  which means that our investment in those entities is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect capital contributions made  dividends received and our respective share of such affiliate s earnings or losses 
all other investments in affiliates  which are not material to our financial statements  are carried at cost 
in the normal course of business  we engage in transactions among our affiliated entities 
these intercompany transactions are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
all of our investments are in operating or corporate holding companies  some of which may qualify under the definition of variable interest entities as defined in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r consolidation of variable interest entities 
while we have no material investments in variable interest entities  all such investments have been appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements or otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto 
revenue recognition our revenues consist of product revenues and fees and royalty revenues 
fees and royalty revenues consist primarily of funded research  technology and license fees and royalties 
our revenues are heavily influenced by business with our major customers 
please refer to the discussion of major customers included in item of this report 
product revenue revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers 
we can group our existing products into three general categories enzymes that break down protein  enzymes that break down starch and enzymes that break down cellulose 
funded research research funding revenues result from collaborative agreements with various parties  including the us government  whereby we perform research activities and receive revenues that partially reimburse expenses incurred 
under such agreements we retain a proprietary interest in the products and technology developed 
these expense reimbursements primarily consist of direct expense sharing arrangements and milestone payments 
revenues related to expense sharing arrangements are recorded as the underlying expenses are incurred 
milestone payments are contingent upon successful completion of research activities and are recognized upon satisfaction of those contingencies 
upfront research funding payments are recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying research agreement 
our funded research revenues are fully dependent upon our progress on the underlying collaborative research projects and can vary from period to period 
technology and license fees fees from the sale of technology are recognized upon completion of the required technology transfer and substantial satisfaction of any performance related responsibilities 
license fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the term defined in the license agreement 
in the event there is no defined term  such as with permanent licenses  license fees are recognized upon substantial satisfaction of any performance related responsibilities 
our technology and license fees can vary from period to period as a result of the number and timing of such transactions 
royalty revenue royalty revenue is recognized in accordance with the underlying contract terms 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  expenses for services rendered related to our funded research activities 
accordingly  in the event our funded research revenues fluctuate from period to period  the related research and development expenses may also fluctuate 
investments in equity securities we hold minority interests in equity securities of certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within our strategic area of focus 
while we are selective in making such investments  once we have obtained the securities  we are at risk for fluctuations in their fair market value 
if these securities experience declines in value which we consider to be other than temporary  we will record an impairment charge to the extent of that decline in value 
poor operating results experienced by these entities or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability to recover our carrying value of these investments 
in we recorded an investment loss of million as a result of such circumstances 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets primarily include patents  licenses  technology  and customer lists 
investments in long lived assets are initially recorded at acquisition cost 
we recognize depreciation on all property  plant and equipment  except land  using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from years 
we also amortize our other intangible assets  except technology  on a straight line basis over estimated lives of years 
land  goodwill and technology are considered to have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not subject to depreciation or amortization 
at least annually  we evaluate whether the remaining useful lives of our depreciable and amortizable assets are appropriate 
changes in these useful lives can result in either increases or decreases in the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in our statement of operations  reflecting shorter or longer lives  respectively 
in addition  we regularly assess all of our long lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
this is accomplished by comparing the expected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets with the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment 
should aggregate future cash flows be less than the carrying value  a write down would be required  measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is estimated either through independent valuation or as the present value of expected future cash flows 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows exceed the respective carrying amount as of the date of assessment  no impairment is recognized 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
while we believe the long lived asset amounts recorded in our balance sheet are properly stated as of december   as we make future assessments of the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
defined benefit pension and post retirement plans as part of our overall employee benefits program  we have defined benefit pension plans and a defined benefit postretirement plan 
the assets  liabilities and related expense of these plans are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  rates of increase of health care costs  rates future compensation increases and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
we annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and makes changes to these assumptions as necessary 
stock based compensation the genencor international  inc omnibus incentive plan the oi plan became effective on may  upon approval by the stockholders at our annual meeting of stockholders 
employees  outside directors  consultants  advisors and independent contractors retained by us are eligible to participate in the oi plan 
the oi plan allows for the grant  at not less than of the market value as of the date of grant  of non qualified and incentive stock options to purchase the company s common stock and stock appreciation rights sars  based on the underlying value of the our common stock 
the oi plan also allows for the grant of restricted and unrestricted stock awards  performance shares stock or stock based awards contingent upon attaining performance objectives or performance units units valued by reference to chosen criteria 
under the terms of the oi plan  the company has the ability to grant awards representing up to million shares of common stock 
in addition  any shares remaining  or shares that become available under the predecessor plan will be available for grant of awards under the oi plan 
generally  stock options and sars vest and become exercisable  ratably over a three year period and expire years from their grant date 
restrictions  if any  on stock awards generally expire at the end of a three year period 
we use the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and have no current plans to convert to the fair value method 
under the intrinsic value method  no compensation expense is recorded for grants of stock based awards when the grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
should the exercise price be below the fair market value on the date of grant  we record this difference as a component of stockholders equity and amortize it as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the stock based award 
for more information regarding our stock based awards  including pro forma disclosures of compensation expense had we employed the fair value method under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition disclosure  please refer to note employee benefit plans included within item of this report 
income taxes the provision for benefit from income taxes included within our statement of operations is based upon pretax financial accounting income loss and is calculated using the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for benefit from income taxes 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future consolidated effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing laws or regulations  future acquisitions or mergers  future levels of research and development spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
furthermore  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit by regulatory authorities in these jurisdictions 
these tax audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we believe that we have appropriately calculated our provision for benefit from income taxes in light of these uncertainties 
our practice is to reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries into operations 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on these earnings  as we do not plan to initiate any action that would require the payment of related us income taxes 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed foreign earnings

restructuring activities during february  as a result of the acquisition of ebs and general economic conditions in latin america  including the devaluation of the argentine peso  we engaged in a plan to restructure our overall supply infrastructure by ceasing operations at our elkhart  indiana plant and downsizing our argentine facilities 
as a result of the plan  restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in our operating earnings for the year ended december  this restructuring was completed during warehouse inventory loss we sustained damage to our finished bioproducts inventory during the three months ended june   as a result of an accident in a third party warehouse in rotterdam  the netherlands 
consequently  through december   we reduced our inventories by approximately million to reflect the estimated amount of product that was lost and recorded approximately million of other costs as receivable from its insurer 
of this amount  we received cash payments of approximately million from our insurer in in addition  there are certain accident related reduced profits and additional costs that are reflected in the results of operations for while we continue to believe that these reduced profits and additional costs will be subject to insurance recovery  we are unable to estimate the ultimate amount of the recovery at this time

we have financed our operations primarily through cash from the sale of products  the sale of stock  research and development funding from partners  government grants  and short term and long term borrowings 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances plus funds to be provided from our current year operating activities  together with those available under our line of credit  will satisfy our funding needs for at least the next twelve months

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total purchase obligations are agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us 
included in this category are capital commitments and agreements to purchase raw materials with fixed volumes and prices 
we expect to receive consideration goods or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligations do not represent our entire anticipated future purchases  including those of a routine nature  such as utilities  maintenance  consulting and supplies  which are purchased as needed 
also  we generally do not purchase raw materials through contracts with fixed volumes  since the majority of our raw materials represent commercially available products from a number of independent sources  which have readily available substitutes 
in addition  we have several research and commercial programs and collaborations under which we may receive or become obligated to pay royalty  milestone and other payments 
these are highly dependent upon various conditions  such as the success of research and development activities and the level of sales of commercialized products 
please refer to the following footnote references from our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further information on the other amounts included in the above table note property  plant and equipment  note notes payable and long term debt  and note employee benefit plans 
our capital leases primarily relate to our administrative office in leiden  the netherlands and a wastewater treatment facility proximate to our manufacturing facility in brugge  belgium 
while our operating leases include certain other facilities and equipment  they principally relate to our administrative offices in palo alto  california and rochester  new york 
other long term liabilities primarily represent pension and post retirement obligations and severance payments which are to be paid over time as a result of previous restructuring activities 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation  agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which we have made guarantees  have a retained or contingent interest in transferred assets  or a similar arrangement  that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  have an obligation under certain derivative instruments  or have any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in such an entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
we assess our contracts in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
guarantees and claims arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers  customers and strategic partners when we undertake an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation 
these potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products  intellectual property and environmental matters  and other indemnifications 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims 
however  while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized  we are not aware of any such claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we have no arrangements of the types described in the other three categories that we believe may have a material current or future adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset be recorded as a liability when those obligations are incurred  with the amount of the liability initially measured at fair value 
upon initially recognizing a liability for an asset retirement obligation  an entity must capitalize the cost by recognizing an increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement

also in december  the fasb issued a revision of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires companies to reevaluate their accounting for certain investments in variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
variable interest entities are to be consolidated if the company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we have no material investments in variable interest entities  all such investments have been appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements or otherwise disclosed in the notes thereto 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this position permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of act 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require the sponsor of such a plan to change previously reported information 
our financial statements do not reflect any implications of the act due to the level of uncertainty about the forth coming guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of our market risk 
to date foreign operations  mainly denominated in euros  accounted for approximately of our product revenues 
we believe that we partially mitigate this risk by having manufacturing facilities located in several locations around the world  which means that our costs are often denominated in the same currency as our product revenues 
we may manage the foreign currency exposures that remain through the use of foreign currency forward contracts  currency options and off setting currency loans where deemed appropriate 
we do not use these instruments for speculative purposes 
at december   there were no forward contracts or option contracts outstanding 
we recorded million in foreign currency gains related to forward contracts in the statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
of this amount  million was denominated in euros 
the remainder or million was primarily denominated in us dollars 
other than the third installment of million due in march  under our senior notes discussed under the heading liquidity and capital resources  in item of this report  short term debt outstanding at december  was not significant 
to the extent us dollar and euro interest rates fluctuate either up or down  the return on the cash investments will also fluctuate 
to the extent such euro cash investments remain outstanding  we will be subject to the risks of future foreign exchange fluctuations and the impact on the translation of these cash investments into us dollars 
interest rates our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates primarily in the united states and europe 
in this regard  changes in the us dollar and euro currency rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments 
our interest expense is generated primarily from fixed rate debt 
the million senior notes outstanding at december   mature evenly in installments of million per year 
annual installment payments commenced march  with three remaining annual installments from march  through march  on january   we entered into an interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest based on the six month london interbank offered rate libor and receive fixed rates of interest at on a million notional amount of our long term indebtedness 
on may   we entered into another interest rate swap contract to pay a variable rate of interest based on the six month libor and receive fixed rates of interest at on an additional million notional amount of our long term indebtedness 
on july   we sold both swap contracts for approximately million in cash 
the gain on the sale will be amortized against interest expense over the original maturity date of the swaps  which is march  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  these interest rate swap contracts that hedged the senior notes had an immaterial effect on the statement of operations and were not material to the balance sheet as of the date of their sale 
foreign currency exposure we conduct business throughout the world 
during the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from foreign operations  and these foreign operations generated income that offset net losses in our us operations during the same yearly period 
economic conditions in countries where we conduct business and changing foreign currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates in europe  latin america  and asia 
the euro and argentine peso present our most significant foreign currency exposure risk 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening of the us dollar  may have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations as they are expressed in us dollars 
our manufacturing and administrative operations for latin america are located in argentina 
a significant part of our latin american revenues are denominated in us dollars 
net foreign exchange gains from us dollar euro and us dollar argentine peso transactions were million for the year ended december  management monitors foreign currency exposures and may in the ordinary course of business enter into foreign currency forward contracts or options contracts related to specific foreign currency transactions or anticipated cash flows 
these contracts generally cover periods of nine months or less and are not material 
we recorded a gain of million in the statement of operations for the year ended december  from foreign currency contracts 
we do not hedge the translation of financial statements of consolidated subsidiaries that maintain their local books and records in foreign currencies 
other the risk factors discussed in item of this report are incorporated herein by reference to the degree they address market risk
