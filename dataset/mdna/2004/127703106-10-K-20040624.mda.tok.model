the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the company s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revisions to these estimates are charged to income in the period in which the revision becomes known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts reflecting estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
live bird and hatching egg inventories are stated at cost and breeder hens are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  consistent with industry standards 
the costs associated with breeder hens are accumulated up to the production stage and amortized over the productive lives using the unit of production method 
finished poultry products  feed  and other inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we record valuations and adjustments for our inventories and for estimated obsolescence at or equal to the difference between the cost of the inventories and the estimated market value based upon known conditions affecting the inventories obsolescence  including significantly aged products  discontinued product lines  or damaged or obsolete products 
we allocate meat costs between our various finished poultry products based on a by product costing technique that reduces the cost of the whole bird by estimated yields and amounts to be recovered for certain by product parts  whi ch are carried in inventories at the estimated recovery amounts  with the remaining amount being reflected at cost or market  whichever is lower 
property  plant and equipment 
in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
as a result  the company records impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  the company utilizes certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i future cash flows estimates expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in the company s operations and estimated salvage values and ii estimated fair market value of the assets 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
contingent liabilities 
the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies  or other factors beyond the company s control 
accrued self insurance 
insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits is estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
stop loss coverage is maintained with third party insurers to limit the company s total exposure 
certain categories of claim liabilities are actuarially determined 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses is reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we review the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet  primarily operating loss carryforwards  based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels of operations and provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk factors industry cyclicality can affect our earnings  especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken 
profitability in the chicken industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of chicken and feed ingredients  which are determined by supply and demand factors  which result in cyclical earnings fluctuations 
the production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by weather patterns throughout the world  the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients  and the agricultural policies of the united states and foreign governments 
in particular  weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner 
a sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients  as well as both the industry s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients  grow chickens and deliver products 
high feed ingredient prices have had a material adverse effect on our operating results in the past 
we periodically seek  to the extent available  to enter into advance purchase commitments for the purchase of feed ingredi ents in an effort to manage our feed ingredient costs 
the use of such instruments may not be successful 
leverage 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and expect to continue to have  an amount of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  our ability to borrow additional funds  and failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default or require redemption of indebtedness 
either of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is dependent on various factors 
these factors include the commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
additional borrowings available 
despite our indebtedness  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness in the future 
contamination of products 
if our products become contaminated  we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls 
livestock and poultry disease 
outbreaks of livestock diseases in general and poultry disease in particular  can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that our flocks are healthy and that our processing plants and other facilities operate in a sanitary and environmentally sound manner 
however  events beyond our control  such as the outbreak of disease  could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations 
furthermore  an outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of our fresh chicken  to or from our suppliers  facilities or customers  or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks 
this could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully and on our business  reputation and prospects 
insurance 
we are exposed to risks relating to product liability  product recall  property damage and injuries to persons for which insurance coverage is expensive  limited and potentially inadequate 
significant competition 
competition in the chicken industry with other vertically integrated poultry companies could adversely affect our business 
government regulation 
regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting our business 
the chicken industry is subject to federal  state and local governmental regulation  including health and environmental areas 
we anticipate increased regulation by various agencies concerning food safety  the use of medication in feed formulations and the disposal of poultry by products and wastewater discharges 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect our business or operations in the future
