item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we are an independent architect of enterprise class information storage infrastructures 
we derive our revenues principally from designing and installing data storage systems 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as disk arrays  tape systems and interconnection components and storage management software products 
the market for data storage products and services is large  estimated at billion in we have locations throughout the united states with the highest concentration of revenues in the central states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
when customers purchase support services through us  customers receive the benefit of integrated support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk to provide routine customer support services covering minor problems 
we fulfill on site assistance by purchasing support service agreements for our customers from our hardware and software vendors or their designated third party service providers and by arranging on site support assistance with the appropriate vendor if necessary 
we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data storage solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
completion of our installation and configuration services may also delay recognition of revenues 
economic conditions over the past several years and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data storage market as having significant opportunity for datalink s growth 
our key focus is on growing our business through the hiring of additional sales and technical staff  improving the productivity of our employees and providing new differentiated storage solutions and professional services that encompass new technologies for our customers 
we plan to return the company to profitability by growing the size of our sales force while continuing to reduce our overhead costs such as costs associated with facilities 
results of operations the following table shows  for the periods indicated  certain selected financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering restructuring charges amortization of goodwill and other intangibles total operating expenses operating loss comparison of years ended december   and net sales 
our product sales increased in from to million  and decreased in from to million 
our service sales  which include customer support and installation services  increased in from to million  and remained relatively flat from to at million in and million in the decline in our product sales since reflects a difficult operating environment as many companies have chosen to significantly reduce their spending on information technology 
the data storage industry as a whole was negatively impacted by these conditions 
additionally  our sales and in particular our product sales are impacted by the number and productivity of our sales representatives 
the number of outside sales representatives declined by from to and by from to the decline reflects the impact of closing several offices and turnover 
we plan to selectively increase the number of outside sales representatives in the coming quarters 
given these developments  we cannot predict if or when our product sales will return to historically higher levels 
the growth in our service revenues between and reflects an increase in new maintenance contract sales and contract renewals by existing customers 
we derived approximately  and of our sales from one customer during  and  respectively 
our largest customer recently began to outsource its information technology and services to a third party provider 
at this time  we are uncertain whether we will continue to provide either product or customer support for this customer or the third party provider 
we cannot be assured that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in and decreased from in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales decreased to in as compared to in and in due to economic conditions over the past several years  our customers are continuing to seek storage solutions to meet minimum needs rather than implementing comprehensive infrastructure changes 
solutions that meet a minimum need generally carry lower product margins than comprehensive infrastructure changes 
in addition  our product gross profit percentage has suffered due to the high level of pricing competition in the marketplace 
given these developments  we cannot predict if or when our product gross profit as a percentage of net sales will return to historically higher levels 
charges for excess and obsolete inventory in  and of   and  respectively  adversely affected our product gross profit 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales increased to in as compared to in and in the increase in gross profit rates for services from to reflects our ability to obtain higher margins on our integrated support services 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the decrease in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars is a result of lower bad debt expense and a reduction in our sales management workforce and expenses in as compared to and the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from as compared to resulted primarily from higher revenues combined with reduced expenses in the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales from as compared to resulted primarily from lower sales combined with increased expenses related to investments in management for our regional structure 
at least initially  the future hiring of additional outside sales representatives may increase our sales and marketing expenses without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or in and million  or in when comparing to  the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars reflects higher property taxes for our chanhassen facility  higher training expenses to maintain vendor certifications and the settlement of a sales and use tax audit 
when comparing to  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars reflects lower hiring costs due to fewer new employees  lower professional services fees due to the completion of several process improvement consulting engagements in and reduced depreciation expense 
our general and administrative expenses were higher as a percentage of net sales in and as compared to because of the reduction in sales 
engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our professional engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses decreased to million  or of net sales in as compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the decrease in engineering expenses in absolute dollars from as compared to reflects an increase in installations and assessments in as compared to and lower travel and entertainment costs associated with the installations 
as a result  there was an increase in engineering costs associated with installation services recorded as cost of service sales 
when comparing to  the engineering expenses remained relatively flat in absolute dollars because there were lower costs associated with a reduction in headcount  lower depreciation expense on our engineering laboratory equipment and lower costs for travel and entertainment due to increased efforts to minimize expenses in these areas 
the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales from as compared to is the result of higher revenues and lower expenses in overall cost reduction initiatives 
because of the continuing difficult economic climate for technology spending and our recent operating losses  we have actively sought to reduce costs across our business 
in october  we announced several cost reduction initiatives and management changes 
these changes resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
as part of these cost reduction initiatives  we reduced our staff by 
employee severance charges were  we also announced the closure of four offices 
office closing costs for lease terminations were  the office closures included closing an office and terminating personnel from our opensystems 
com  inc acquisition in november  resulting in an impairment of our customer base intangible asset 
the resulting impairment charge of the asset was  we expect to gain further fixed expense reductions as we aggressively seek alternatives for reducing facility costs at our chanhassen location in the fourth quarter restructuring initiative reduced costs  favorably impacting sales and marketing  general and administrative  and engineering expenses 
as of december   the annualized cost savings  compared to the cost structure in place as of the beginning of the fourth quarter  is in excess of million 
we cannot assure that we achieve this level of annual cost savings 
goodwill and other intangible amortization 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets decreased to  in compared to million in and million in the amortization relates primarily to our acquisition of the data storage and services business of opensystems 
com  inc in november due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  our amortization expense decreased by million in from this statement required that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test for impairment annually or whenever impairment is indicated 
for we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge on our opensystems 
com customer base intangible asset in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
during  we amortized the remaining  balance of the customer base intangible asset we acquired in our july acquisition of direct connect systems  inc in  we amortized the remaining  balance of the trademark and name intangible asset we acquired in that acquisition 
this is because we are not operating under the direct connect systems name and realization of future uses became uncertain in the fourth quarter of for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
operating loss 
we incurred operating losses of million in compared to million in and  in the operating loss includes the million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of the decrease in operating income from as compared to was principally attributable to our sales decline under difficult economic conditions combined with an increase in our operating expenses designed to position us for future revenue growth and market share gains 
income taxes 
we provided for an income tax benefit of  in and  in and income taxes of  in the income tax benefit generated for represents a higher than expected federal income tax refund from our tax return 
included in the income tax provision for is a non cash charge of million related to the recording of a valuation reserve for the deferred tax asset 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon carry back to prior periods and upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
based upon the level of taxable losses in and and the near term uncertainty of taxable income  management cannot reasonably predict when or if these deductible differences will be realized 
in addition  we do not have the ability to realize future income tax benefits on future losses 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly financial data for each quarter of and in our opinion  this unaudited information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all adjustments including all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the information set forth below 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

in thousands net sales gross profit operating loss net loss we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our net sales as a result of a number of factors  including the length of the sales cycle with customers for large storage system evaluations and purchases  delays in storage system installations or configurations  new product introductions by suppliers and their market acceptance  delays in product shipments or other quality control difficulties  our ability to integrate any acquired businesses  trends in the enterprise class information storage industry in general  the geographic and industry specific market in which we are currently active  or may be in the future  and the opening of new field offices 
in addition  economic conditions over the past several years and competition also affect our customers decisions to place orders with us 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and capital requirements through cash flows generated from operations  supplemental bank borrowings and the proceeds from our offerings of our common stock 
our working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  our current ratio was at december  as compared to at december  at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million 
cash provided by operating activities for was million as compared to  in and million in the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets 
this included a million income tax refund  a million reduction in inventory shipped but not installed with fewer projects left to be completed at year end  a  reduction in field evaluation inventory  and a million reduction in accounts receivable due to an improvement in our days sales outstanding offset by a million reduction in accounts payable 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in our net operating assets from timing of certain payments and receipts and a reduction in the overall level of working capital 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from a reduction in inventories offset by a decrease in payables 
the reduction in inventories for resulted from our increased efforts to optimize our inventory levels and to complete the installation of products for customers at year end 
cash used in investing activities during each of and was million compared to million in in  we used this cash to complete our own storage and data recovery project  purchase computer equipment and provide further enhancements to our customer relationship management information systems and our business reporting software tool 
in  we used this cash primarily to implement our customer relationship management information system 
in  we purchased furniture and fixtures for our new corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota and invested in our new information and phone systems and engineering laboratory equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during and was  and million  respectively 
cash used in financing activities was  in in  we received  from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options 
in  we received million from a direct private offering of newly issued common stock to institutional investors and  from stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan 
the cash provided was partially offset by the final scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former stockholder 
in  we made a scheduled payment of  on a note due to a former stockholder  which was partially offset by  of proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and stock option exercises 
effective june   we signed a new credit agreement with a commercial bank that provides for an million revolving line of credit for financing our working capital needs 
the term of the agreement ends june  borrowings under the line of credit are secured by our accounts receivable and inventory and are subject to certain financial and operating covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a maximum level of funded debt cash flow ratio and a minimum amount of working capital  tangible net worth and debt net worth ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this agreement 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of december  for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
we have an year non cancelable operating lease for our corporate headquarters in chanhassen  minnesota which expires in the lease requires base rental payments of approximately million in the first year and million for each subsequent year 
for more information  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
we plan to seek one or more subtenants for the facility in order to reduce our fixed operating expenses 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual cash obligations consisting of future minimum lease payments due under non cancelable operating leases and severance payments in conjunction with our fourth quarter restructuring initiatives are as follows lease obligations sublease agreements net lease obligations severance obligation total in thousands thereafter we believe that funds generated from operations  together with the available credit under our revolving credit agreement  will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we are planning for  to million of capital expenditures through primarily related to enhancements to our management information systems 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where more critical estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition 
the company realizes revenue from the design  installation and support of data storage solutions  which may include hardware  software and services 
the company recognizes revenue when it has met its obligations for installation or other services and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements to the hardware  software and services elements of its data storage solutions 
for software or hardware product sales whereby the company does not provide any installation or configuration services  revenue is recognized upon shipment 
for data storage solutions with hardware  software and services sold as a bundled arrangement  the company considers the services to be essential to the functionality and revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis pursuant to american institute of certified public accountants sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for using contract accounting include the nature of the services ie consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of acceptance criteria on the realizability of product and services revenues 
as the company has vendor specific objective evidence of the values of its hardware  software and services  it uses the relative fair values of these elements to allocate revenues between product sales and service sales on its data storage projects 
service sales 
the company also sells service contracts to most of its customers 
these contracts are support service agreements 
the company has an internal support desk to provide integrated customer support services 
the company fulfills on site assistance by purchasing support service agreements for customers from the hardware and software vendors or their designated third party service providers and by arranging on site support assistance with the appropriate vendor when necessary 
when the service contracts are sold as part of a data storage solution in a bundled arrangement  the company uses vendor specific objective evidence to allocate revenue to the service contract element 
the revenues and direct costs resulting from these service contracts are deferred and amortized into operations over the term of the contracts  which are generally twelve months 
the company is contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide these underlying support services to its customers in the unlikely event that the hardware or software vendor  or its designee  fails to perform according to the terms of its contract 
for consulting services contracts that do not include the sale of hardware or software product  the company recognizes revenue as the services are performed 
deferred revenue is comprised of deferrals for maintenance and other services for which payment has been received and for which the service has not yet been performed 
inventory 
we periodically review  estimate and adjust our reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the inventory cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
results could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of economic or competitive conditions  length of industry downturn  or if products become obsolete because of technical advancements in the industry 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  and reclassified  of assembled workforce to goodwill 
as a result  we have ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on total market capitalization as compared to the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets it may prompt us to engage a third party valuation firm to perform a valuation of us to further assess whether our goodwill or other intangibles are impaired pursuant to sfas we consider our goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
other intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we amortize customer lists using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
in october  we announced several cost reduction actions 
these actions included the closure of an office and terminating personnel we acquired from our opensystems 
com acquisition in november as a result  we incurred an impairment of our customer base intangible asset 
we estimated the impact that closure of the office and termination of its personnel would have on the opensystems 
com customer accounts and the related expected discounted cash flows  considering the likelihood of retaining the customers without an office presence 
we then compared the undiscounted cash flows with the net book value of the intangible asset which indicated the asset was impaired 
to determine the impairment charge  we calculated the discounted cash flows and compared them to the net book value of the intangible and determined the resulting impairment charge of the asset was  income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts we believe are more likely than not to be realizable 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our earnings for the deferred tax in the period we make this determination 
as a result of our cumulative losses over the past two years and the full utilization of our loss carry back potential  we concluded during the fourth quarter of fiscal to make a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance at december  was million 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on any future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 stock compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not plan to change our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in december  the eitf issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable  and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
this issue was applicable for the company beginning in july and did not have an impact on revenue recognition 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which supersedes sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
rescinds accounting guidance in sab no 
related to multiple element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years 
we cannot assure you that inflation will not adversely affect our business in the future 
risk factors as indicated in this annual report under the caption note regarding forward looking statements  certain information contained in this annual report consists of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements made in this annual report include the following economic conditions continue to adversely impact our revenues and profits 
since mid  we have experienced a difficult and highly competitive economic climate and operating environment 
the high level of economic uncertainty has led to an overall reduction in capital spending  including spending for technology 
some of our customers have canceled or delayed planned purchases 
others have replaced large storage solution installation projects with smaller  piecemeal projects that carry lower profit margins for us 
competition for available business has also affected our margins 
as a result  we have incurred losses for each of the last nine successive quarters 
we cannot predict the continuing effect of economic conditions over the past several years on our business 
if our revenues and cash flows continue to be adversely affected  we may need to further reduce our expenses or personnel 
this could adversely affect our ability to capitalize on future technology spending by our customers at such time as economic conditions improve 
competition could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues or profitability 
the enterprise class information storage market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
as technologies change rapidly  we expect that competition will increase in the future 
we compete with independent storage system suppliers to the high end market and numerous resellers  distributors and consultants 
we also compete in the storage systems market with general purpose computer suppliers 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  purchasing and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of products and deliver competitive products at lower end user prices 
some of our current and potential competitors include our suppliers 
we are not the exclusive supplier of any data storage product we offer 
instead  our suppliers market their products through other independent data storage solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and  often  through their own internal sales forces 
we believe direct competition from our suppliers is likely to increase if  as expected  the data storage industry continues to consolidate 
this consolidation would probably result in fewer suppliers with greater resources to devote to internal sales and marketing efforts 
in addition  our suppliers have established and will probably continue to establish cooperative relationships with other suppliers and other data storage solution providers 
these cooperative relationships are often intended to enable our suppliers to offer comprehensive storage solutions  which compete with those we offer 
if our relationships with our suppliers become adversarial  it will be more difficult for us to stay ahead of industry developments and provide our customers with the type of service they expect from us 
in addition  most of our customers already employ in house technical staffs 
to the extent a customer s in house technical staff develops sophisticated storage systems expertise  the customer may be less likely to seek our services 
further  we compete with storage service providers who manage  store and backup their customers data at off site  networked data storage locations 
future goodwill impairment may unpredictably affect our financial results 
effective january  under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we perform impairment analyses of our goodwill at least annually or when we believe there is an impairment 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from a small number of customers 
in  we derived of our revenues from one customer  and our top five customers collectively accounted for of our revenues 
our largest customer recently began to outsource its information technology and services to a third party provider 
at this time  we are uncertain whether we will continue to provide either product or customer support for this customer or the third party provider 
we cannot assure you that this customer will account for a substantial portion of our future sales 
because we intend to continue to seek out large projects  we expect that a significant percentage of our revenues will continue to come from a small number of customers  although the composition of our key customers is likely to change from year to year 
if we fail to obtain a growing number of large projects each year  our revenues and profitability will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  our reliance on large projects makes it more likely that our revenues and profits will fluctuate unpredictably from year to year 
unpredictable revenue and profit fluctuations may make our stock price more volatile and lead to a decline in our stock price 
our revenue recognition policies unpredictably defer reporting of our revenues 
we increasingly sell complex enterprise class information storage solutions 
we do not recognize revenues from our sale of hardware and software products to our customers until we complete our required installation or configuration of these products 
installation and configuration of these solutions requires significant coordination with our customers and vendors 
therefore  even if we have shipped all products to our customers  we may be unable to control the timing of product installation and configuration 
these delays prevent us from recognizing revenue on products we ship and may adversely affect our quarterly reported revenues 
as a result  our stock price may decline 
our cost reduction initiatives may unpredictably impact expected financial results 
in october  we announced several cost reduction initiatives and management changes 
these changes resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
to reduce facility costs  we plan during to seek one or more subtenants for our headquarters and other locations 
these cost reduction initiatives may accelerate expenses that we might otherwise incur over a longer period of time  unpredictably impacting our financial results 
accounting for equity compensation future accounting changes may adversely impact our expected financial results 
under current accounting rules  we do not record charges to our financial statements in connection with the grant at fair market value of employee stock options 
however  we expect these accounting rules to change 
these new option related expenses may unpredictably affect our reported results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
we rely on only a few key suppliers and would suffer materially if we could not obtain their products 
we rely on our close relationships with our suppliers to provide access to products and new technology necessary to design and implement leading edge enterprise class information storage solutions for our customers 
we do not have long term supply contracts with any of our suppliers 
in many instances  we rely upon only one or two suppliers for each of our key products 
our reliance on these suppliers leaves us vulnerable to an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries and poor product quality 
disruption or termination of the supply of products from our suppliers for any reason would likely prevent or delay our shipments to our customers 
our customers expect reliable and prompt service from us 
if we cannot obtain necessary components  or the components we obtain are unreliable or unexpectedly expensive  we will not meet our customers expectations 
if we cannot meet our customers expectations  our business will suffer considerably 
our business depends on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel 
our future operating results depend upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineers with enterprise class information storage solutions experience 
if we fail to recruit and retain additional engineering personnel  or if continued losses require us in the future to terminate employment of some of these personnel  we will experience greater difficulty realizing our growth strategy  which could negatively affect our business  financial condition and stock price 
we generally do not have employment agreements with our key employees 
our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our executive officers  managers  salespeople  engineers and other technical personnel  many who have substantial experience in our industry and would be difficult to replace 
in general  we do not have employment  non competition or nondisclosure agreements with our officers or employees  including our executive officers 
accordingly  our employees may voluntarily leave us at any time and work for our competitors 
our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to retain our current employees and hire new employees 
any failure to retain our key employees will make it much more difficult for us to maintain our operations and attain our growth objectives and could therefore be expected to adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and stock price 
if we cannot effectively manage our future growth  our business may suffer 
our planned growth and expansion  if realized in light of economic conditions over the past several years  would place a significant strain on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
this growth may also increase demands on our professional and technical services  sales  marketing and customer service and support functions 
our planned geographic expansion may exacerbate these challenges and require us to hire  train  motivate and manage new management  technical  sales and administrative employees 
if we manage this planned growth poorly  we may be unable to continue to provide our customers with the high level of technical service and expertise they expect from us 
this failure would harm our reputation  hamper our ability to grow and adversely affect our financial condition and stock price 
if the data storage industry fails to develop compelling new storage technologies  our business may suffer 
rapid and complex technological change  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards increase demand for our services 
because of this  our future success depends in part on the data storage industry s ability to continue to develop leading edge storage technology solutions 
our customers utilize our services in part because they know that newer technologies offer them significant benefits over the older technologies they are using 
if the data storage industry ceases to develop compelling new storage solutions  or if a single data storage standard becomes widely accepted and implemented  it will be more difficult to sell new data storage systems to our customers 
our long sales cycle may cause fluctuating operating results  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our sales cycle is typically long and unpredictable  making it difficult to plan our business 
economic conditions over the past several years have increased this uncertainty 
our long sales cycle requires us to invest resources in potential projects that may not occur 
in addition  our long and unpredictable sales cycle may cause us to experience significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results 
it can also result in delayed revenues  difficulty in matching revenues with expenses and increased expenditures 
our business  operating results or financial condition and stock price may suffer as a result of any of these factors 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
currently  our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
acting together  these insiders may be able to elect our entire board of directors and control the outcome of all other matters requiring stockholder approval 
this voting concentration may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or control or otherwise discourage potential acquirers from attempting to gain control of us 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering  and may continue to be volatile 
we cannot assure you that our stock price will increase  or even that it will not decline significantly from the price you pay 
our stock price may be adversely affected by many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  new products or services offered by us  our suppliers or our competitors  changes in estimates by securities analysts of our future financial performance  and general market conditions  including the effects of economic conditions over the past several years and war and terrorism threats 
our governing documents and minnesota law may discourage the potential acquisitions of our business 
our board of directors may issue additional shares of capital stock and establish their rights  preferences and classes  in some cases without stockholder approval 
in addition  we are subject to anti takeover provisions of minnesota law 
these provisions may deter or discourage takeover attempts and other changes in control of us not approved by our board of directors 
if potential acquirers are deterred  you may lose an opportunity to profit from a possible acquisition premium in our stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we do not believe that we have any material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had million of cash and money market accounts 
a decrease in market rates of interest would have no material effect on the value of these assets or the related interest income due to the nature of money market accounts 
we have no short or long term debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we market and sell all of our products in the united states 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
equity price risk 
we do not own any equity investments 
therefore  we are not currently exposed to any direct equity price risk
