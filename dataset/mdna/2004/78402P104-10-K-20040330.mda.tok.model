item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of scpie holdings inc and subsidiaries 
certain statements in the following discussion that are not historical fact constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements regarding the company  its business prospects and results of operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties posed by many factors and events that could cause the company s actual business  prospects and results of operations to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such risks  uncertainties and other factors are discussed in business risk factors and in periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview scpie holdings is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in providing insurance and reinsurance products 
the company is primarily a provider of medical malpractice insurance and related liability insurance products to physicians  healthcare facilities and others engaged in the healthcare industry in california and delaware 
previously  the company had also been actively engaged in the medical malpractice insurance business and related products in other states and the assumed reinsurance business 
during and  the company largely completed its withdrawal from the assumed reinsurance market and medical malpractice insurance outside of california and delaware 
the company s insurance business is organized into two reportable business segments direct healthcare liability insurance and assumed reinsurance operations 
primarily due to significant losses on medical malpractice insurance outside of the state of california and assumed reinsurance business losses arising out of the september   world trade center terrorist attack  the company incurred significant losses in the three fiscal years  and the resulting reductions in surplus and corresponding decrease in capital adequacy ratios under both the am best company am best and national association of insurance commissioners naic capital adequacy models has required the company to take actions to improve its long term capital adequacy position 
the primary actions taken by the company were to begin a withdrawal from all healthcare liability insurance markets outside of california and delaware in and to enter into a quota share reinsurance agreement in december to retrocede to another insurer the majority of reinsurance business written in and critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related notes 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
premium revenue recognition direct healthcare liability insurance premiums written are primarily earned on a daily pro rata basis over the terms of the policies 
accordingly  unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which is applicable to the unexpired portion of the policies in force 
reinsurance premiums assumed are estimated based on information provided by ceding companies 
the information used in establishing these estimates is reviewed and subsequent adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined 
these premiums are earned over the terms of the related reinsurance contracts 

table of contents loss and loss adjustment expense reserves unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are comprised of case reserves for known claims  incurred but not reported reserves for unknown claims and any potential development for known claims  and reserves for the cost of administration and settlement of both known and unknown claims 
such liabilities are established based on known facts and interpretation of circumstances  including the company s experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments and pending levels of unpaid claims  as well as court decisions and economic conditions 
the effects of inflation are considered in the reserving process 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided 
any increase in the amount of reserves  including reserves for insured events of prior years  could have an adverse effect on the company s results for the period in which the adjustments are made 
the company utilizes both its internal actuarial staff and independent consulting actuaries in establishing its reserves 
the company does not discount its loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the company had a growing volume of assumed reinsurance between and assumed reinsurance is a line of business with inherent volatility 
ultimate loss experience for the assumed reinsurance operation is based primarily on reports received by the company from the underlying ceding insurers 
many losses take several years to be reported through the system 
the company relies heavily on the ceding entity s  especially lloyd s syndicates  estimates of ultimate incurred losses 
ceding entities  representing over of the reinsurance assumed business for the to underwriting years based on gross written premiums  submit reports to the company containing ultimate incurred loss estimates reviewed by independent or internal actuaries of the ceding entities 
these reported ultimate incurred losses are the primary basis for the company s reserving estimates 
in other cases  the company relies on its own internal estimates determined primarily by experience to date  individual knowledge of the specific reinsurance contract  industry experience and other actuarial techniques to determine reserve requirements 
because the reserve establishment process is by definition an estimate  actual results will vary from amounts established in earlier periods 
the company recognizes such differences in the periods they are determined 
since reserves accumulate on the balance sheet over several years until all claims are settled  a determination of inadequacy or redundancy could easily have a significant impact on earnings and therefore stockholders equity 
a difference in the ultimate value of reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  would decrease or increase future pretax earnings by million 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs include commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing business 
deferred policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income  including investment income 
if such costs are estimated to be unrecoverable  they are expensed 
recoverability is analyzed based on the company s assumptions related to the underlying policies written  including the lives of the underlying policies  growth rate of the assets supporting the liabilities  and level of expenses necessary to maintain the policies over their entire lives 
deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
investments the company considers its fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are available to be sold in response to a number of issues  including the company s liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates and investment management strategies  among others 
during the fourth quarters of and  the company sold significant amounts of its available for sale securities to increase surplus for statutory accounting purposes 
in late and  the company began to shift the character of its investment income to fully taxable in recognition of the company s current tax position 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
the related unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  are excluded from net income and reported as a component of stockholders equity 

table of contents the company evaluates the securities in its available for sale investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in market value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
some of the factors the company considers in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the market value of the security is less than its cost basis  the length of time for which the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuers industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that is judged to be other than temporary is realized as a loss in the current period and reduces the cost basis of the security 
income taxes at december   the company had million of net deferred income tax assets 
net deferred income tax assets consist of the net temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible or revenue recognized in periods different for tax return purposes than for accounting purposes 
these deferred income tax assets include an asset of million for a net operating loss carryforward that will expire in a net operating loss carryforward is a tax loss that may be carried forward into future years 
it reduces taxable income in future years and the tax liability that would otherwise be incurred 
the company believes it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized through its future earnings 
as a result  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance 
in relation to the net operating loss carryforward  the company has been historically profitable except for the last three years because of losses primarily related to the non core healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance operations 
since those operations are now in run off  the company believes it should return to a position of taxable income  thus utilizing the net operation loss carryforward 
the company s estimate of future taxable income used the same assumptions and projections as in their internal financial projections 
these projections are subject to uncertainties primarily related to future underwriting results 
if the company s results are not as profitable as expected  the company may be required in future periods to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets 
that requirement would reduce the company s earnings 
results of operations three year comparison direct healthcare liability insurance background the company has been a leading writer of medical malpractice insurance for physicians and healthcare providers in california for many years 
in  the company began expansion into other professional liability products and into other geographical markets 
the principal product expansion was into professional liability insurance for hospitals 
from through  the company added more than hospitals to its program 
these policies were written through national and regional brokers and covered facilities in four states outside california 
at approximately the same time  the company undertook a major geographic expansion in the physician and small medical group market through an arrangement with brown brown  a leading publicly held insurance broker 
this arrangement commenced in  eventually encompassed nine states and in was expanded to include dentists in two states 
during the same period  the company also expanded into underwriting greater risk nonstandard physicians in a number of states outside california 

table of contents the company encountered intense price competition in its hospital expansion efforts 
during  the company incurred unacceptable losses under its hospital policies 
the company experienced adverse loss development in its prior years loss reserves for hospitals and significant ongoing losses in this program  which is reflected in the results for the year ended december  the company substantially reduced its hospital exposures during through policy nonrenewals and rate increases 
at the beginning of  it insured only hospitals  and this was reduced to hospitals at december   and the last hospital policy expired in december in  and  the company derived approximately  and of its healthcare liability earned premium volume  respectively  from policies issued outside the state of california  principally under the brown brown and nonstandard physician programs 
in  the company recognized that these programs were seriously underpriced and implemented significant premium increases  averaging approximately and in and  respectively  in its principal non california markets 
the company also immediately instituted more stringent underwriting and pricing guidelines in these states 
despite the significant price increases and more stringent underwriting guidelines  the non california programs produced significant underwriting losses in  and the company and brown brown agreed in early to terminate both the physician and dental programs no later than march  during  the company continued to issue and renew those policies under the brown brown programs that satisfied the stringent underwriting standards 
the company applied these same standards to the nonstandard physician policies renewed outside california 
as of december    policies were in force related to the brown brown program 
that number was reduced to and policies as of december  and  respectively 
the company issued no new nonstandard physician policies outside of california in or during  the company will continue to concentrate its efforts on maintaining its core physician and medical group business in california and delaware 
the company does not expect to initiate any significant new programs outside california during assumed reinsurance background the company rapidly expanded its assumed reinsurance operations after the formation of the division in late written premiums were   and million  respectively for  and earned premiums  which lag behind written premiums  were   and million  respectively for  and assumed reinsurance represents the book of assumed worldwide reinsurance of professional  commercial and personal liability coverages  commercial and residential property risks  accident and health and workers compensation coverages and marine coverages 
ultimate loss experience in this segment is based primarily on reports received by the company from the underlying ceding insurers 
actual losses may take several years to be reported through the system 
in  the unprecedented september   terrorist attack materially impacted the results in this segment 
the company identified losses of million  net of reinsurance benefit as of december   and a further million and million in losses has been recorded in and  respectively 
the company significantly reduced its assumed reinsurance operations in and due to the adverse impact on its capital and surplus from the world trade center losses and losses incurred in healthcare insurance outside california 
in addition  in february  a 
m 
best reduced the insurance subsidiaries ratings to b very good from a excellent  reflecting the rating agency s view of the company s decline in financial strength and operating performance at that time 
many ceding companies and companies in assumed reinsurance syndicates are reluctant to deal with insurers whose ratings are below a  which made it more difficult for the company to remain in the assumed reinsurance market 
the assumed reinsurance operations were significantly reduced in during  the company pursued various financial alternatives to improve its capital position  including a complete or partial divestiture of its assumed reinsurance operations 
in december  the company entered into a quota share 
table of contents reinsurance transaction with goshawk reinsurance limited goshawk re  a bermuda reinsurance subsidiary of goshawk insurance holdings plc  a publicly held london based lloyd s underwriter goshawk  under which the company ceded to goshawk re almost all of its unearned assumed reinsurance premiums as of june   together with written reinsurance premiums after that date  in each case related to the assumed reinsurance business for the and underwriting years 
the effect of this transaction was to retrocede to goshawk million of written premium in and million of written premium in the company retains certain losses related to the assumed reinsurance business  including those related to the world trade center  and the company continues to participate in one lloyd s syndicate for the underwriting year 
the goshawk re treaty relieved the company of underwriting leverage in and and improves the company s risk based capital adequacy ratios under both the am best and naic models 
other than net written premiums of million from the lloyd s syndicate in  the company had no significant net premiums written from prior year contracts

as a result of the company s withdrawal from certain segments of the healthcare industry  the premiums earned are allocated between core and non core premium 
core premium represents california and delaware business excluding the brown brown dental program and hospital business 
non core business 
table of contents represents business related to the brown brown programs  other state non standard physician programs and hospital programs including those in california 
the following table summarizes by core and non core business the underwriting results of the direct healthcare liability insurance segment for the periods indicated

premiums earned in the core business increased and in and  respectively  primarily due to rate increases 
the company has historically had a high renewal rate in its core business 
the renewal rates of insureds who were offered renewal was in both and the company primarily loses insureds due to underwriting actions taken by the company  insureds moving to competitors  leaving their practice  retiring or joining a health facility which provides for their insurance 
these losses are offset by new sales activities 
the core business policies inforce were  policies   policies and  policies at year end  and  respectively 

table of contents the loss ratio for was compared to a loss ratio of for the change in loss ratio reflected increases in average claim costs offset by a decline in the frequency of claims and the effect of the average rate increases on earned premiums 
the underwriting expense ratio increased from in to in the primary reason for the change was additional expenses connected with the rate approval hearing and regulatory triennial audit expenses in excess of amounts previously accrued 
the expense ratio decreased in compared to  primarily due to a smaller proportion of the core business being written through general agencies  thus decreasing commission expenses 
non core business premiums written decreased in to million from million in and million in this resulted from significant average rate increases of and in and  respectively  being offset by even more significant declines in the number of insureds from  at december   to and insureds at december  and  respectively 
the increases in rates and the significant decline in insureds resulted from the company s actions taken to mitigate the significant losses arising from this business 
after march   as the company exited these markets  no new or renewal business was written in the non core programs 
premium earned in the non core direct healthcare liability insurance business decreased as the company withdrew from states other than california and delaware and its hospital program wound down 
the loss ratio in of compared to in is the result of continued deterioration and additional upward development in loss reserves for prior years of million in in addition  general increases in average claim costs continued to rise for the non core business 
the underwriting expense ratio increased in versus as the ratio was artificially low due to expensing of previously deferred acquisition costs in in light of the unprofitability of the non core business 
the underwriting expense ratio changed from in to in and in no acquisition costs related to non core business were deferred in or assumed reinsurance segment the following table summarizes the underwriting results of the assumed reinsurance segment for the periods indicated 
assumed reinsurance segment underwriting results for the year ended december  premiums written premiums earned underwriting expenses losses underwriting and other operating expenses underwriting loss loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the assumed reinsurance segment declined in  as the full effect of the retrocession to goshawk re took effect 
the premiums written for the assumed reinsurance segment were essentially unchanged from  as premiums were ceded under the goshawk re treaty in the fourth quarter premiums earned decreased to 
table of contents million in from million in and million in because of reduction in treaty programs to one account and the cession of premiums written to goshawk re 
the loss ratio declined in to from in and in the  and loss ratios were impacted by  and percentage points  respectively  because of the world trade center terrorist attack 
the underwriting and other operating expense ratio was in and in and in the underwriting and other operating expense ratio increased in over as premiums decreased in relation to fixed expenses 
the underwriting and other operating expense ratio increased in over  primarily because of the goshawk transaction expenses discussed below 
the december goshawk re treaty ceded effectively all of the unearned premium and future reported premium after june   for the assumed business written for underwriting years and by the company million in and million in 
the treaty has no limitations on loss recoveries and includes a profit sharing provision should the combined ratios calculated on the base premium ceded be below 
the treaty requires goshawk re to reimburse the company for its acquisition and administrative expenses 
in addition  the company is required to pay goshawk re additional premium in excess of the base premium ceded of or an estimated million 
the additional premium reduced and earned premium by and million  respectively  and will reduce earned premium by an estimated million 
the goshawk re reinsurance treaty has both prospective and retroactive elements as defined in financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
as such  any gains under the contract will be deferred and amortized to income based upon the expected recovery 
no gains are anticipated currently 
losses related to future earned premium ceded  as well as development on losses related to existing earned premium ceded after june   will ultimately determine whether a gain will be recorded under the contract 
the retroactive accounting treatment required under fasb requires that a charge to income be recorded to the extent premiums ceded under the contract are in excess of the estimated losses and expenses ceded under the contract 
the charge related to the cession of the unearned premium as of july   and ceded premium written in the third quarter is included in operating expenses in the assumed reinsurance segment 
the charge and placement fees amounted to million in and million in the retroactive accounting treatment accounted for and percentage points of the expense ratio in and  respectively 
september  loss attributable to goshawk the company has had an ongoing relationship with goshawk and its two business operations  syndicate at lloyd s of london syndicate and goshawk re a reinsurance company in bermuda 
in  the company made a common stock investment in goshawk of million representing of the then outstanding shares of goshawk 
in addition  the company participated through its assumed reinsurance segment in two treaties reinsuring syndicate for the and underwriting years 
one treaty is a marine excess of loss reinsurance treaty and the other treaty was a quota share treaty covering syndicate s net retained business 
in late september  goshawk announced that syndicate had incurred significant losses in its   and years of account 
the losses stemmed primarily from two programs initiated in the losses were so significant goshawk announced it would need to raise capital in syndicate and was reviewing its strategic options 
goshawk reported that goshawk re and its operations would not be materially affected by the financial problems of syndicate on october   syndicate was required to stop writing new business and was placed in run off by regulators at lloyd s of london 
goshawk stated it would focus its further efforts on its goshawk re bermuda operations 
the sudden goshawk financial deterioration produced a significant loss to the company in the quarter ended september  the value of the company s ownership interest in the goshawk common stock declined materially and the 
table of contents company wrote down its investment by million to million based on the market value of goshawk common stock on september  the company also reported an assumed reinsurance loss of million in the third quarter for its share of the increased losses reported in goshawk syndicate under its two reinsurance treaties 
goshawk re has an a rating from am best and the cession of business to goshawk re is on a funds withheld basis whereby premiums ceded under the contract are kept in trust to collateralize goshawk re s obligations to the company 
other operations december  in thousands net investment income net realized investment gains average invested assets average rate of return before taxes the decrease in net investment income in from levels is primarily related to the decline in average invested assets resulting from lower premiums and loss payments related to the non core healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance businesses 
in addition  the net investment income was reduced in as the average rate of return before tax decreased due to the significant realized gains recognized in the latter half of the lower rate reflects the rates available for reinvestment at the time as the quality of the portfolio was maintained 
the decrease in net investment income in from levels is primarily related to changes in reinvestment rates available in the latter half of as the company realized the investment gains 
the net realized gains of includes the million write down of the company s goshawk stock investment in the third quarter of the year offset by other gains recognized to increase statutory surplus 
income taxes the company had an income tax benefit of million in compared to a benefit of million and million in and  respectively 
because the company has historically been profitable on a tax basis except for the period  the company does not have a valuation allowance related to its net deferred tax asset 
the company currently has a net deferred tax asset of million as of december   of which million relates to a net operating loss carryforward of million  which expires in the company will be able to utilize this carryforward to reduce taxes in future periods 
the losses in to which gave rise to the operating loss carryforward were derived primarily by underwriting losses generated by the non core direct healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance businesses 
since these operations are now in run off and the core business has historically been profitable on both a gaap and tax basis after consideration of investment income  the company s projections indicate that it is more likely than not that the net operating carryforward will be fully utilized within the carryforward period 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition the primary sources of the company s liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses  lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums and taxes 
because of uncertainty related to the timing of the payment of claims  cash from operations for a property and casualty insurance company can vary substantially from period to period 
during and  the company had negative cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively  compared to positive cash flow of million in 
table of contents the negative cash flow in and is principally attributable to decreased premiums written and increased loss payments on the non core healthcare liability business and the goshawk re reinsurance agreement 
as the company continues to pay off non core healthcare liability and assumed reinsurance reserves generated by prior years written premiums  the company may continue to have negative cash flow from operations 
the company invests its cash flow from operations principally in taxable fixed maturity securities 
the company s current policy is to limit its investment in equity securities and real estate to no more than of the total market value of its investments 
accordingly  the company s portfolio of unaffiliated equity securities had a fair value of million at december   compared to million at december  the company plans to continue its focus on taxable fixed maturity securities for the indefinite future 
the company maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in high quality  short term securities and cash to meet short term operating liquidity requirements  including the payment of losses and lae 
cash and cash equivalents investments totaled million  or of invested assets  at december  the company believes that all of its short term and fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
scpie holdings is an insurance holding company whose assets primarily consist of all of the capital stock of its insurance subsidiaries 
its principal sources of funds are dividends from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities 
the insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state regulation in the amount of dividends they can pay in relation to earnings or surplus  without the consent of the applicable state regulatory authority  principally the california department of insurance 
scpie holdings principal insurance company subsidiary  scpie indemnity  may pay dividends to scpie holdings in any month period  without regulatory approval  to the extent such dividends do not exceed the greater of i of its statutory surplus at the end of the preceding year or ii its statutory net income for the preceding year 
applicable regulations further require that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs  and permit the payment of dividends only out of statutory earned unassigned surplus unless the payment out of other funds receives regulatory approval 
the amount of dividends that scpie indemnity is able to pay to scpie holdings during without prior regulatory approval is approximately million 
common stock dividends paid to stockholders were per share in these dividends were funded through dividends received from the insurance subsidiaries in prior years 
the company has suspended the quarterly dividend payable on march  payment of future dividends is subject to board approval  earnings and the financial condition of the company 
as of december   scpie holdings held cash and short terms securities of million 
based on historical trends  market conditions and its business plans  the company believes that its sources of funds including dividends from the insurance subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet the liquidity needs of scpie holdings over the next months and beyond 
the company had borrowings of million outstanding at december   under a credit agreement with three bank lenders 
on february   the company fully repaid the outstanding balance  and the parties terminated the credit agreement 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
the company s capital adequacy position has been weakened by the continuing losses in the non core business  particularly the million loss incurred in september due to the unexpected losses attributable to goshawk 
on november   am best  after a review the third quarter results  reduced the rating of the insurance subsidiaries to b fair  with a negative outlook 
a 
m 
best assigns this rating to companies that have  in its opinion  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
the naic has developed a methodology for measuring the adequacy of an insurer s surplus which includes a rbc formula designed to measure state statutory capital and surplus needs 
the rbc rules provide for different levels of regulatory attention based on four thresholds determined under the formula 
at december   the rbc level of each insurance subsidiary exceeded the threshold requiring the least regulatory attention 
at december   scpie indemnity exceeded this threshold by million 

table of contents the company believes that it has the ability to fund its continuing operations at current and increased levels from its premiums written and investment income 
the company plans to focus on the efficient operation of its core business  while at the same time continuing to adjudicate and settle claims incurred in its discontinued non core business 
as the company continues to run off the non core loss and lae reserves  its capital position should improve 
the company believes it has  at best  only limited opportunities to raise capital  if that becomes necessary 
the company may improve its capital adequacy and rbc ratios through temporary reinsurance arrangements with highly rated insurers 
contractual commitments the company has certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally for providing letters of credit in connection with its assumed reinsurance segment and for leasing office space for its headquarters and other regional offices 
the table below presents the contractual payments due by period or expiration period for each obligation or commitment contractual commitments as of december   are as follows thereafter payments due by period in thousands operating leases in november  the company arranged a letter of credit facility in the amount of million with barclays bank plc 
letters of credit issued under the facility fulfill the requirements of lloyd s and guarantee loss reserves under reinsurance contracts 
as of december   letter of credit issuance under the facility was approximately million 
securities of million are pledged as collateral under the facility 
effect of inflation the primary effect of inflation on the company is considered in pricing and estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement  such as medical malpractice claims 
the actual effect of inflation on the company s results cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  the company believes that loss and lae reserve levels and the company s rate making process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the investment portfolio of the company is subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of fixed maturity investments 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to fixed maturities are limited due to the large number of such investments and their distributions across many different industries and geographics 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity securities  which at december   comprised of total investments at market value 
us government bonds represents of the market values of fixed maturity investments  with the remainder consisting almost entirely of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds 
equity securities  consisting primarily of common stocks  account for of total investments at market value 
a secured mortgage loan accounts for of total investments at market value 
cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid short term money market funds  representing 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio goes up with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that takes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents the value of the common stock equity investments is dependent upon general conditions in the securities markets and the business and financial performance of the individual companies in the portfolio 
values are typically based on future economic prospects as perceived by investors in the equity markets 
the company sold its investment in a limited partnership  which invests in a portfolio of offshore hedge funds 
this investment had a value of million at december  the company realized a gain of million on the sale 
the company s invested assets are subject to interest rate risk 
the following table presents the effect on current estimated fair values of the fixed maturity securities available for sale and common stocks assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates and a decline in equity prices 
the analysis excludes real estate and the other investment 
carrying value estimated fair value at current market rates prices estimated fair value at adjusted market rates prices as indicated below in thousands december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks december  interest rate risk fixed maturity securities available for sale equity price risk common stocks adjusted interest rates assume a basis point increase in market rates adjusted equity prices assume a decline in market values for all its financial assets and liabilities  the company seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
the estimated fair values at current market rates for financial instruments subject to interest rate risk in the table above are the same as those disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling where appropriate 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity eg  mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of the company s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited  as it does not consider any actions the company could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices
