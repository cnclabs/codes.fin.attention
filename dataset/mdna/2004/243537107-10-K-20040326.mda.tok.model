overview we are a leading producer and brand manager of innovative high quality footwear and the category creator in the sport sandal and luxury sheepskin footwear segments 
our products are marketed under three recognized brand names that we own teva high performance sport sandals and rugged outdoor footwear  ugg authentic luxury sheepskin boots and other footwear  and simple innovative shoes that combine the comfort elements of athletic footwear with casual styling 

table of contents we sell our three brands through our customers and directly to our consumers through our internet and catalog retailing business 
we sell our footwear in both the domestic market and the international markets 
independent third parties manufacture all of our footwear 
our business has been impacted by several important trends affecting our end markets the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our retailers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market creators and leaders 
by emphasizing our brand image and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can better maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
set forth below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
teva overview our teva lines experienced strong market acceptance in teva s products have benefited recently from several factors  but most prominently a general shift in consumer preferences and lifestyles to include more outdoor recreational activities 
at the same time  our consumers are increasingly purchasing our teva products for everyday wear  and our teva brand now includes several closed toe footwear lines 
as a result  our brand remains popular among professional and amateur outdoorsmen seeking authentic  performance oriented footwear  as well as general footwear consumers seeking high quality  durable and comfortable styles for everyday use 
to capitalize on the growth of outdoor recreational activities and the acceptance of certain footwear products for everyday use  we have selectively expanded the distribution of our teva product lines outside our core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels 
through effective channel management  we believe we can continue to expand into new distribution channels without diluting our outdoor heritage and our appeal to outdoor enthusiasts 
through channel appropriate product line expansion  we plan to continue to broaden our product offerings beyond sport sandals to new products that meet the style and functional needs of our consumers 
ugg overview in the latter half of  our ugg brand received increased publicity and experienced heightened demand that was ahead of our expectations 
as a result of the rapid growth in demand  we sold out of key ugg product early in the season  and given the long lead times required to replenish our inventory levels  we were unable to fill many retailer reorders and many direct internet and catalog orders 
continuing a strategy utilized with our ugg casual line  we have begun shifting a portion of our ugg sheepskin boot production from factories in australia to a factory in china where the production capacity is much greater and quality standards are comparable 
we expect to receive our first deliveries of sheepskin boots from the china factory in march ugg has been a well known brand in california for many years and has only recently become a recognized brand across the remainder of the country 
we believe that a portion of ugg s increased demand is due to our continued geographical expansion across the us  which has increased consumer awareness of the quality  comfort and usefulness of the products offered by our luxury brand 
in addition  in order to satisfy 
table of contents virtually untapped international demand  we will expand our distribution and marketing overseas 
we believe the international markets represent an attractive opportunity to build upon ugg s broad us appeal 
we also recognize that a portion of the increased demand is a result of a current fashion trend  particularly with respect to the new colors recently added to our ugg boot line 
recognizing that there is a fashion element to this increasing demand  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the trend by offering a broader product line of luxurious and distinctive sheepskin fabrications suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
we have expanded our product line from models in to models in simple overview after three consecutive years of net sales declines in our simple product line  we recently implemented a strategy to improve simple s results of operations and generate renewed interest in the simple brand 
we began a process of repositioning our simple product line by focusing on our successful legacy collections and narrowing the number of styles 
in addition  we have begun to implement a strategy whereby we leverage our teva and ugg expertise to produce simple branded sandals and suede  fleece lined products 
the simple products will be sold at price points lower than our teva and ugg brands and through distribution channels that are precluded from offering our teva and ugg brands 
we expect our simple brand to experience growth as we successfully implement our product line rationalization and channel management strategies 
internet and catalog retailing overview we acquired our internet and catalog retailing business in november  accordingly  was our first full year of operation of this consumer direct business 
our internet and catalog retailing business  which today sells all three of our brands  enables us to meet the growing demand for all of these products and also provides us with an opportunity to add significant incremental contribution margin 
managing our internet business requires us to focus on generating internet traffic to our websites  effectively converting website visits into orders and maximizing average order sizes 
to drive our catalog order business  we distribute approximately  catalogs semi annually 
overall  our consumer direct business benefits from the strength of our brands and  as we grow our brands over time  we expect our internet and catalog retailing business to benefit 
licensing overview in we embarked on a strategy to license our well known and respected footwear brands to complementary products outside of footwear  generally in the apparel and accessories categories 
to date  we have entered into four licensing agreements for teva  including domestic licenses for men s sportswear  timepieces  eyewear and headwear  and one domestic licensing arrangement for ugg handbags and other small leather goods 
we are pursuing additional licensing opportunities for our brands both in the us and abroad 
this licensing strategy is in its early stages  and due to the lead times required to bring the products to market  we have received no sales from licensing to date and we do not expect significant incremental net sales and profits from licensing in the near future 
however  we believe licensing opportunities for our brands may become a more significant portion of our net sales and profits over time 
the minimum net annual royalties that we will receive under the five existing licensing agreements  assuming renewal options are exercised  are  in   in   in   in and  in seasonality our business is seasonal  with the highest percentage of teva net sales occurring in the first and second quarters of each year and the highest percentage of ugg net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters  while the quarter with the highest percentage of annual net sales for simple has varied from year to year 

table of contents first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands net sales income loss from operations first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands net sales income from operations in previous years we have experienced our highest sales level in the first quarter  which has been teva s strongest selling season  while the third quarter has historically had the lowest sales volume 
however  in  as a result of the continued growth in ugg and the introduction of the fall closed toe teva offering  the first and fourth quarters had comparable sales volumes and the second and third quarters had comparable sales volumes 
given our expectations for each of our brands in  we currently expect this trend to continue and anticipate that net sales in the last half of will likely exceed net sales during the first half of nonetheless  actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition and our customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties

net income 
on january   we implemented statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized to earnings but instead be reviewed periodically for impairment

in addition  we acquired the teva rights in november  which added  in net sales from the internet and catalog business  and we settled the montana lawsuit for  in november net sales 
net sales increased by  or  from  in to  in this was largely due to an increase in the number of units sold  primarily in the domestic teva and ugg brands  but offset by a decrease in the number of simple units sold  which contributed to an overall increase of in the volume of footwear sold from  pairs in to  in the increase also resulted from the addition of net sales from the internet and catalog retailing business of  which was acquired in november these net sales increases were partially offset by a decline in average selling price per unit from in to in net wholesale sales of teva increased by  or  from  in to  in this increase was largely attributable to an improvement in retail sell through  increasing sales volume of our sport sandals and the introduction of our new fall line of closed toe rugged outdoor footwear

net sales of the internet and catalog retailing business for the period from the november  acquisition date through december  aggregated  including retail sales of teva of  ugg of  and simple of  the teva rights acquisition did not have a significant impact upon operations in due to its close proximity to year end 
international sales for all brands decreased slightly from  in to  in  representing of net sales in and in gross profit 
gross profit increased by  or  from  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit margin decreased slightly from in to in the decrease in gross margin was due to several factors including an increased impact of closeout volume  particularly for the simple brand 
in addition  the gross margin in was negatively impacted by a  factory charge for tooling costs in the impact of these items was partially offset by a  reduction in inventory write downs in compared to  gross margin improvement as a result of a shift in ugg s sales mix toward higher margin styles sourced from the far east and the negotiation and receipt of a  chargeback from a factory in the first quarter of related to the settlement of a dispute that arose in selling  general and administrative expenses

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
see contractual obligations below 
we do not believe that these operating leases are material to our current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources prior to the acquisition of the teva rights  we financed our capital and operating needs using a combination of the cash generated from operations and the credit availability under our  revolving credit facility 
in addition to these sources of financing  in connection with the acquisition of the teva rights in  we obtained approximately  of incremental financing from additional senior and subordinated debt arrangements 
this additional financing was used solely to fund the teva acquisition  whereas the cash from operations and the available credit under the revolving credit facility continue to provide the cash required for our capital and operating needs 
the seasonality of our business requires us to build inventory levels in anticipation of the sales for the coming season 
teva generally begins to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters  whereas ugg begins to build its inventories in the second quarter and third quarter to support sales for the fall and winter selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
however  given the currently increased demand for ugg products  we also expect to build additional ugg inventories during the first quarter of for deliveries that will begin in the second quarter 
our simple product line is less seasonal than our teva and ugg lines and has significantly fewer inventory fluctuations 
our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of these inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables 
given the seasonality of our teva and ugg brands  our working capital requirements fluctuate significantly throughout the year 
the cash required to fund these working capital fluctuations is generally provided using a combination of our internal cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during  the net borrowings under our line of credit  net of cash balances  fluctuated by approximately  between our highest net cash position in december and our peak borrowing period in september cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in net cash provided by operating activities in was largely due to an improvement in net earnings exclusive of the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle in of  and an improvement in cash collections of  in as compared to working capital remained essentially the same from to cash from investing activities 
in  net cash used in investing activities was  including  of cash paid in conjunction with the acquisition of the teva rights  plus approximately  of capital expenditures 
in  net cash used in investing activities was  which was comprised almost entirely of cash used for capital expenditures 
in  our capital expenditures were greater than in because in we completed the implementation of our enterprise resource planning erp computer system and we incurred most of the costs related to the expansion of our distribution facility that we began in september and completed in march 
table of contents cash from financing activities 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was  largely due to the proceeds from the various sources of financing obtained to finance the acquisition of the teva rights 
in  net cash used in financing activities aggregated  including the repayment of long term debt of  and the repurchase of all outstanding convertible preferred stock for  offset by proceeds from stock issuances of  our liquidity consists primarily of cash  trade accounts receivable  inventories and a revolving credit facility 
at december   working capital was  including  of cash 
cash provided by operating activities aggregated  in trade accounts receivable decreased by from  at december  to  at december  notwithstanding net sales having increased during the fourth quarter ended december  over the comparable prior period 
accounts receivable turnover improved from times in to times in this improvement resulted from the hiring of more qualified credit and collections staff  the improvement in collections policies and procedures and the non recurrence of the fiscal collections difficulties encountered during the initial stages of the implementation of the new erp system 
during the same period  inventories increased by from  at december  to  at december   reflecting a  increase in teva inventory  a  decrease in ugg inventory and a  decrease in simple inventory at year end 
overall  inventory turnover improved from times in to times in the  increase in teva inventory occurred because the factories delivered more teva products in for the season than they did in for the season  due to our efforts to improve our on time deliveries to our customers and to enable us to better deliver complete orders to our customers earlier for the spring season 
the increase in teva inventory was also needed to support an expected increase in teva sales for the first quarter of compared to actual sales for the first quarter of the  decrease in ugg inventory at december  was due to the heightened demand experienced in the latter part of  which significantly depleted our year end inventory levels for many of the most popular ugg styles 
the  decrease in simple inventory at december  reflects our continuing efforts to reduce the levels of our closeout inventories and to bring our simple inventory into stock closer to when it is expected to be shipped to our customers 
our revolving credit facility with comerica bank california provides for a maximum availability of  subject to a borrowing base 
in general  the borrowing base is equal to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  and of eligible inventory  as defined 
up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  or  at our option  at libor at december  plus to  depending on our ratio of liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  termed ebitda and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility included an upfront fee of  and includes subsequent annual commitment fees of  the facility expires on june  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility  no foreign currency reserves for outstanding forward contracts and no outstanding letters of credit 
we had credit availability under the facility of  at december  on november   we completed the acquisition of the teva rights from mark thatcher and his wholly owned company  teva sport sandals  inc  for approximately  including transaction costs of approximately  we paid cash in the amount of  and issued to mr 
thatcher a junior subordinated note in the principal amount of  convertible preferred stock of   shares of common stock valued at approximately  and options to purchase  shares of common stock valued at approximately  the  of junior subordinated note includes a coupon interest rate of and an additional interest rate of  which is to be accrued and paid at the maturity date in the note may be prepaid without penalty 
concurrent with the acquisition  we entered into an employment agreement for advice on teva matters with mr 
thatcher through november  which provides for an annual base salary of  and we received a non compete agreement from mr 
thatcher  which expires two years after termination of employment 

table of contents in connection with the teva rights acquisition  we entered into two additional financing arrangements  including a  term loan from comerica bank california and a  subordinated note from an unrelated party 
based on intercreditor agreements between the various parties  we generally were not permitted to repay the subordinated note or the junior subordinated note or repurchase the convertible preferred stock without the prior approval and consent of comerica bank california 
likewise  we generally were not permitted to repay the junior subordinated note or repurchase the convertible preferred stock without the prior approval and consent of both comerica bank california and the holder of the subordinated notes 
since initially entering into these financing arrangements  we have taken several steps to improve our capital structure 
after obtaining the requisite approvals discussed above  we made the following changes during  we prepaid  of the  subordinated note  consisting of a  prepayment in june and another  in december in connection with the prepayments in  we incurred prepayment penalties of  and wrote off approximately  of previously capitalized loan origination costs 
these costs have been included in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  additionally  we prepaid  of the subordinated note in january  bringing the total prepayments to an aggregate of  since inception 
as a result of the prepayments  the balance of the subordinated note outstanding at december  was  and the balance outstanding at january  was  by making these prepayments  replacing  of the subordinated note with lower cost financing  we expect to save more than  in annual interest costs for each of the next five years 
in december  we repurchased all of the outstanding convertible preferred stock for  in connection with the repurchase  we paid the holder a premium of approximately  which is treated as a capital transaction and accordingly had no impact on net income in  although the repayment reduced income loss per share applicable to common stockholders 
going forward  the transaction is expected to eliminate approximately  shares from the weighted average diluted shares outstanding calculation beginning in during  we paid  of the term loan in accordance with the scheduled payment terms 
in december  we renegotiated with the lender and reset the term loan to  we used the  of additional proceeds in conjunction with cash generated from operations to fund the repayment of the subordinated notes and to repurchase the convertible preferred stock discussed above to take advantage of lower interest rates 
the renegotiated  term loan is secured by all of our assets and bears interest at the prime rate at december  plus  or  at our option  at libor at december  plus 
in accordance with the amended payment terms  interest is payable monthly  an initial principal payment of  is payable may  and the remaining principal is payable in monthly installments of approximately  from june to november we incurred a fee of  in connection with the increase in term loan borrowings in december the remaining  of the subordinated note outstanding at december   at january  is secured by a secondary security position in all assets  with principal payable in quarterly installments of  beginning in november and the balance due in full in november the subordinated note bears interest at  of which is payable monthly and can be deferred at our option and compounds monthly until the maturity date 
during  we elected not to defer any interest costs and as a result paid all interest as it was incurred 
in the event that we decide to prepay all or a portion of the subordinated note  we will be required to pay prepayment penalties of of the portion prepaid prior to november   with no penalties for prepayments thereafter 
in connection with the issuance of the subordinated note  we incurred costs of approximately  including investment banking fees  loan commitment fees and legal costs 
these origination costs are included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are being amortized over the term of the loan 

table of contents the  junior subordinated note is due in november the junior subordinated note bears interest at  of which is payable annually and may be deferred at our option and compounds annually until the maturity date

the junior subordinated note is unsecured and subordinated to the subordinated note  the term loan and the bank credit facility and does not have prepayment penalties 
the junior subordinated note provides the holder with the right to designate one member of our board of directors 
at december   the outstanding balance on the junior subordinated note was  plus the deferred interest of in accordance with its terms  the convertible preferred stock was callable by us through november  at face amount plus an additional per year and was convertible into common stock by the holder after november   if not previously called  at a conversion price of per share the fair market value of the common stock on the issue date 
as noted above  we repurchased the convertible preferred stock in its entirety in december  thus eliminating the potential for any future conversion into common stock 
the agreements underlying the bank credit facility  the term loan and the subordinated note contain several financial covenants including a quick ratio requirement  profitability requirements and cash flow coverage requirements  among others  as well as a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  and remain so as of the date of this report 
we have announced that we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to sell up to  shares of our common stock and up to  shares of common stock held by selling stockholders not counting any exercise of the over allotment option to purchase up to  shares of common stock granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters 
we expect to pay off the remaining  of the term loan   of the subordinated note and  of the junior subordinated note from the proceeds of the potential offering 
upon the completion of the potential offering and repayment of our outstanding debt  the borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility will be the full  amount of the facility  subject to the borrowing base lending requirements 
capital expenditures totaled  in and related primarily to the replacement of certain computer equipment  the expansion and new racking at our distribution center and costs related to new teva promotional vehicles 
we currently have no material commitments for future capital expenditures but estimate that the capital expenditures for will range from  to  and will include an upgrade of the distribution center computer system  new trade show booths and replacements and upgrades of certain other computer equipment 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for may differ from this estimate  largely depending on any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period more than total less than year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total additionally  we have significant interest payment requirements on the long term debt obligations discussed above 
assuming we continue to pay both the current interest portion and the deferred interest portion of the subordinated note on a monthly basis and assuming we continue to pay 
table of contents annually only the current interest portion while deferring the deferred interest portion of the junior subordinated note  the annual interest payment requirements for our long term debt obligations are as follows  after giving effect to the  prepayment of the subordinated note in january payments due by period less than more than total year years years years interest payments the above table does not include interest on the bank credit facility  as the outstanding borrowings on the facility are variable 
while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   we anticipate that we may borrow under the facility in in order to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
in  the average outstanding borrowings under the facility were  and the aggregate interest costs under the facility were  in february  we agreed to guarantee up to  of a bank loan of doug otto  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  which matures june  the guarantee is through the maturity date of the loan  and we would have to pay under the guarantee should mr 
otto default on the loan 
as of december   approximately  was outstanding under the loan 
the fair value of the guarantee was immaterial at december  we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  cash on hand and the net proceeds of the potential offering will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
we have demonstrated our strong liquidity by the debt prepayments and the convertible preferred stock redemption in totaling  see risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
impact of inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing  known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts which 
table of contents are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a general reserve for the balance of accounts 
reserves have been fully established for all expected or probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts by  reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are expected to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
we determine the amount of the reserve for sales discounts considering the amounts of available discounts in the period end accounts receivable aging and historical discount experience  among other factors 
at december  the reserve for sales discounts was approximately  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts by  allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we base the amount of the allowance on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change in historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns at december  was  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns by approximately  inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down amount by approximately  valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we periodically assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider the assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  our future plans regarding utilization of the assets  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the assets  and changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if we consider the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

table of contents risk factors our short and long term success is subject to many factors beyond our control 
shareholders and potential shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this report and the information incorporated by reference in this report 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in that case  the value of our common stock could decline and shareholders and potential shareholders may lose all or part of their investment 
risks relating to our business our success depends on our ability to anticipate fashion trends 
our success depends largely on the continued strength of our teva  ugg and simple brands and on our ability to anticipate  understand and react to the rapidly changing fashion tastes of footwear consumers and to provide appealing merchandise in a timely manner 
our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change 
we are also dependent on customer receptivity to our products and marketing strategy 
there can be no assurance that consumers will continue to prefer our brands  that we will respond quickly enough to changes in consumer preferences or that we will successfully introduce new models and styles of footwear 
achieving market acceptance for new products also will likely require us to exert substantial marketing and product development efforts and expend significant funds to create consumer demand 
the failure to introduce new products that gain market acceptance will erode our competitive position  which will reduce our profits and could adversely affect the image of our brands  resulting in long term harm to our business 
our ugg brand may not continue to grow at the same rate it has experienced in the recent past 
our ugg brand has experienced strong growth over the past two years  with net wholesale sales of ugg products having increased from  in to  in  representing a compound annual growth rate of 
ugg may be a fashion item that could go out of style at any time 
ugg represents a significant portion of our business  and if ugg sales fail to increase in the future our overall financial performance likely will not continue its current pace of growth 
we may experience shortages of top grade sheepskin  which could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs 
we depend on a limited number of key resources for sheepskin  the principal raw material for our ugg products 
in  two suppliers provided all of the sheepskin purchased by our independent manufacturers 
the top grade sheepskin used in ugg footwear is in high demand and limited supply 
in addition  sheep are susceptible to hoof and mouth disease  which can result in the extermination of the infected herd and could have a material adverse effect on the availability of sheepskin for our products 
our potential inability to obtain top grade sheepskin for ugg products could impair our ability to meet our production requirements for ugg in a timely manner and could lead to inventory shortages  which can result in potential lost sales  delays in shipments to customers  strain on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
additionally  there have been significant increases in the prices of footwear quality sheepskin as the demand for this material has increased 
any further price increases will likely raise our costs  increase our costs of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers 
if we do not accurately forecast consumer demand  we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have difficulty filling our customers orders 
because the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for design and production  we must commit to production tooling and production volumes many months before consumer tastes become apparent 
the footwear industry is subject to fashion risks and rapid changes in consumer preferences  as well as the effects of weather  general market conditions and other factors affecting demand 
our large number of models  colors 
table of contents and sizes in our three product lines exacerbates these risks 
as a result  we may fail to accurately forecast styles and features that will be in demand 
if we overestimate demand for our products  we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at a discount to customers  resulting in higher markdowns and lower gross margins 
further  the excess inventories may prolong our cash flow cycle  resulting in reduced cash flow and increased liquidity risks 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand  we could have inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strains on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
this may be particularly true with regard to our ugg product line  which continues to experience strong consumer demand and rapid sales growth 
we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we seek to enhance the positioning of our brands  extend our brands into complementary product categories and markets through licensing  expand geographically and improve our operational performance 
another element of our growth strategy includes our licensing initiatives 
we may not be able to successfully implement any or all of these strategies 
if we fail to do so  our rate of growth may slow or our results of operations may decline  which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of our stock 
our financial success is limited to the success of our customers 
our financial success is directly related to the success of our customers and the willingness of our customers to continue to buy our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
sales to our customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by our customers 
if we cannot fill our customers orders in a timely manner  our relationships with our customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on us 
furthermore  if any of our major customers experiences a significant downturn in its business  or fails to remain committed to our products or brands  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
establishing and protecting our trademarks  patents and other intellectual property is costly and may be difficult outside the us if our efforts to do so are unsuccessful  the value of our brands could suffer 
we believe that our trade names  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  patents  trade dress and designs are of value and are integral to our success and our competitive position 
some countries laws do not protect proprietary intellectual property rights to the same extent as do us laws 
from time to time  we discover products in the marketplace that infringe upon our trade name  trademark  patent  trade dress and design rights 
if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party s products on the basis of patent and trade dress rights  continued sales of such competing products by third parties could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our efforts to enforce our trademark and other intellectual property rights are typically met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our trademark and other intellectual property rights 
similarly  from time to time we may be the subject of litigation challenging our ownership of intellectual property 
loss of our teva  ugg or simple trade name  trademark  patent or trade dress rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we face particularly strong challenges to our ugg trademark in australia 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in such challenges 
many australian manufacturers sell competitive footwear on the internet 
the loss of our ugg trademark in australia could cause us to lose significant sales and could harm the integrity of our brand by association with inferior products 
we may lose pending litigation and the rights to certain of our intellectual property 
we are currently involved in several informal disputes  disputes in the us patent and trademark office and foreign trademark offices  and disputes in us federal and foreign court litigation regarding infringement by third parties of our trade names  trademarks  trade dress  copyrights and other intellectual property 
any decision or settlement in any of these disputes that allows a third party to continue to use our intellectual 
table of contents property in connection with products that are similar to ours could have an adverse effect on our sales and on our intellectual property  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
counterfeiting of our brands can divert sales and damage our brand image 
our brands and designs are constantly at risk for counterfeiting and infringement of our intellectual property rights  and we frequently find counterfeit products and products that infringe on our intellectual property rights in our markets 
we have not always been successful  particularly in some foreign countries  in combating counterfeit products and stopping infringing uses of our products 
counterfeit and infringing products not only cause us to lose significant sales  they also can harm the integrity of our brands by associating our trademarks or designs with lesser quality or defective goods 
we are also experiencing more infringers of our ugg trademark and more counterfeit products seeking to benefit from the consumer demand for our ugg products 
we expect this trend to continue  which could result in the loss of sales for ugg products and a diminution of the brand s reputation for quality if it is associated with inferior counterfeit goods 
as our patents expire  our competitors will be able to copy our technology or incorporate it in their products without paying royalties 
patents generally have a life of years from filing  and some of our patents will expire in the next ten years 
for example  the patent for our universal strapping system used in teva sandals will expire in september our universal strapping system is currently used in most of our teva sandals 
once patent protection has expired  our competitors can copy our products or incorporate our innovations in their products without paying royalties 
to combat this  we must continually create new designs and technology  obtain patent protection and incorporate the new technology or design in our footwear 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so 
sales of our teva sandals may decline significantly if we incorporate substitute technologies in lieu of our universal strapping system for our teva sandals 
because we depend on independent manufacturers  we face challenges in maintaining a continuous supply of goods that meet our quality standards 
we use independent manufacturers to produce all of our products  with almost all of the production occurring among four manufacturers in china 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain manufacturing capacity 
the manufacturers in turn depend upon their suppliers of raw materials 
we do not exert direct control over either the independent manufacturers or their raw materials suppliers  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
in addition  we do not have long term contracts with these independent manufacturers  and any of them may unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of products of an acceptable quality from our independent manufacturers 
if there is an interruption  we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers because substitutes may not be available or they may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality  at an acceptable price or on a timely basis 
if a change in our independent manufacturers becomes necessary  we would likely experience increased costs  as well as substantial disruption of our business and a resulting loss of sales 
similarly  if we experience a significant increase in demand and a manufacturer is unable to ship orders of our products in accordance with our timing demands and our quality standards  we could miss customer delivery date requirements 
this in turn could result in cancellation of orders  customer refusals of shipments or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 
we compete with other companies for the production capacity and the import quota capacity of our manufacturers 
accordingly  our independent manufacturers may not produce and ship some or all of any orders placed by us 

table of contents if raw materials do not meet our specifications or if the prices of raw materials increase  we could experience a high return rate  a loss of sales or a reduction in our gross margins 
our independent manufacturers use various raw materials in the manufacture of our footwear that must meet our specifications generally and  in some cases  additional technical requirements for performance footwear 
if these raw materials and the end product do not perform to our specifications or consumer satisfaction  we could experience a higher rate of customer returns and a diminution in the image of our brands  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there may be significant increases in the prices of the raw materials used in our footwear  which would increase the cost of our products from our independent manufacturers 
our gross profit margins are adversely affected to the extent that the selling prices of our products do not increase proportionately with increases in their costs 
any significant unanticipated increase in the prices of raw materials could materially affect our results of operations 
no assurances can be given that we will be protected from future changes in the prices of such raw materials 
our independent manufacturers are located outside the us  where we are subject to the risks of international commerce 
all of our third party manufacturers are in the far east  australia and new zealand  with the vast majority of production performed by four manufacturers in china 
foreign manufacturing is subject to numerous risks  including the following tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules  increasing transportation costs due to energy prices or other factors  poor infrastructure and shortages of equipment  which can delay or interrupt transportation and utilities  foreign currency fluctuations  restrictions on the transfer of funds  changing economic conditions  changes in governmental policies  environmental regulation  labor unrest  which can lead to work stoppages and interruptions in transportation or supply  political unrest  which can interrupt commerce and make travel dangerous  and expropriation and nationalization 
in particular  because most of our products are manufactured in china  adverse change in trade or political relations with china or political instability in the far east could severely interfere with the manufacture of our products and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
uncertainty regarding the short term and long term effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  and the outbreak of avian influenza in china and elsewhere in the far east could disrupt the manufacture and transportation of our products  which would harm our results of operations 
we are also subject to general risks associated with managing operations effectively and efficiently from the us and understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs 
these factors and the failure to properly respond to them could make it difficult to obtain adequate supplies of quality products when we need them  resulting in reduced sales and harm to our business 

table of contents we may be subject to certain federal regulatory fines 
we were recently notified by a governmental agency that we have improperly shipped certain water repellant and a cleaning solution for our footwear manufactured by one of our suppliers that is listed as a hazardous material in federal regulations 
we are reporting to the agency directly and have discontinued shipping the product 
the agency might assert sanctions against us which could range from a nominal amount to a larger amount which might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business could suffer if our independent manufacturers  their suppliers or our licensees violate labor laws or fail to conform to our ethical standards 
we require our independent contract manufacturers  their suppliers and our licensees to meet our standards for working conditions  environmental protection and other matters before we are willing to place business with them 
as a result  we do not always obtain the lowest cost production 
we do not control our independent manufacturers  their suppliers or their respective labor practices 
if one of our independent contract manufacturers or one of their suppliers violates our labor standards by  for example  using convicted  forced or indentured labor or child labor  fails to pay compensation in accordance with local law or fails to operate its factories in compliance with local safety regulations  we likely would immediately cease dealing with that manufacturer or  in the case of a supplier  we would likely require our manufacturer to immediately cease using that supplier  and we could suffer an interruption in our product supply 
in addition  the manufacturers or their suppliers actions could damage our reputation and the value of our brands  resulting in negative publicity and discouraging customers and consumers from buying our products 
similarly  we do not control our licensees or any of their suppliers or their respective labor practices 
if one of our licensees violates our labor standards or local laws  we would immediately terminate the license agreement  which would reduce our license revenue 
in addition  the licensee s actions could damage our reputation and the value of our brands 
we also may not be able to replace the licensee 
if our licensing partners are unable to meet our expectations regarding the quality of their products or the conduct of their business  the value of our brands could suffer 
one element of our growth strategy depends on our ability to successfully enter into and maintain license agreements with manufacturers and distributors of products in complementary categories 
although we have not received any material license revenue to date  we will be relying on our licensees to maintain our standards with their manufacturers in the future  and any failure to do so could harm our reputation and the value of the licensed brand 
the interruption of the business of any one of our material licensing partners due to any of the factors discussed immediately below could also adversely affect our future licensing sales and net income 
the risks associated with our own products will also apply to our licensed products in addition to any number of possible risks specific to a licensing partner s business  including  for example  risks associated with a particular licensing partner s ability to obtain capital  manage manufacturing and product sourcing activities  manage labor relations  maintain relationships with suppliers  manage credit risk effectively  and maintain relationships with customers 
our licensing agreements generally do not preclude our licensing partners from offering  under other brands  products similar to those covered by their license agreements with us 
if we cannot replace existing licensing partners who fail to perform adequately  our net sales  both directly from reduced licensing revenue and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products  will suffer 

table of contents if our brand managers cannot properly manage the licensees of their respective brands  our growth strategy could be impaired 
our growth strategy and future profits depend upon each of our brand managers finding and successfully managing licensees for each of their respective brands 
our brand managers may not be able to successfully implement the licensing aspect of our growth strategy and to develop and manage profitable license arrangements 
we compete for opportunities to license our brands with other companies who have greater resources than we do and who may have more valuable brands and more licensing experience than we do 
as a result  even if we do identify a suitable licensee  we may lose the opportunity to a competitor 
our brand managers failure to execute our licensing strategy successfully could negatively impact our results from operations 
we may be unable to successfully identify  develop or acquire  and build new brands 
we intend to continue to focus on identifying  developing or acquiring and building new brands 
our search may not yield any complementary brands  and even if we do find a suitable brand we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund the development or acquisition of the brand 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the management of a new brand into our existing operations  and we cannot assure you that any developed or acquired brand will achieve the results we expect 
we compete with other companies who have greater resources than we do for the opportunities to license brands or buy other brands 
as a result  even if we do identify a suitable license or acquisition  we may lose the opportunity to a competitor who offers a more attractive price 
in such event  we may incur significant costs in pursuing a license or an acquisition without success 
our quarterly sales and operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and if we fail to meet expectations the price of our common stock may decline 
our quarterly sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to do so in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our sales and operating results include the following variation in demand for our products  including variation due to changing consumer tastes and seasonality  our ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to manage inventories  accounts receivable and cash flows  our ability to control costs  the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of orders from customers  the introduction of new products by competitors  the availability and reliability of raw materials used to manufacture our products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our independent manufacturers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general  the mix of our domestic and international sales  and the risks and uncertainties associated with our international business  our ability to forecast future sales and operating results and subsequently attain them  developments concerning the protection of our intellectual property rights  and general global economic and political conditions  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism 

table of contents in addition  our expenses depend  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales 
in particular  we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of our products 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in sales  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
accordingly  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
loss of the services of our key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success and growth depend on the continued services of doug otto  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  scott ash  our chief financial officer  bob orlando  the president of the teva division  connie rishwain  the president of the ugg and simple divisions  and pat devaney  senior vice president of global sourcing  production and development  as well as other key officers and employees 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals or any other key employee could materially affect our business 
our future success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain additional qualified personnel 
competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining them 
we conduct business outside the us  which exposes us to foreign currency and other risks 
our products are manufactured outside the us  and our independent manufacturers procure most of their supplies outside the us we sell our products in the us and internationally 
although we pay for the purchase and manufacture of our products primarily in us dollars and we sell our products primarily in us dollars  we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us denominated assets  liabilities and income since our foreign distributors sell in local currencies  which impacts the price to foreign customers 
we currently do not use currency hedges since substantially all our transactions are in us dollars 
future changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause changes in the dollar value of our purchases or sales and materially affect our results of operations 
our most popular products are seasonal  and our sales are sensitive to weather conditions 
sales of our products  particularly those under the teva and ugg brands  are highly seasonal and are sensitive to weather conditions 
extended periods of unusually cold weather during the spring and summer can reduce demand for teva footwear 
likewise  unseasonably warm weather during the fall and winter months may reduce demand for our ugg products 
the effect of favorable or unfavorable weather on sales can be significant enough to affect our quarterly results  with a resulting effect on our common stock price 
we depend on independent distributors to sell our products in international markets 
we sell our products in international markets through independent distributors 
if a distributor fails to meet annual sales goals  it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor 
if a change in our distributors becomes necessary  we may experience increased costs  as well as substantial disruption and a resulting loss of sales 
our sales in international markets are subject to a variety of laws and political and economic risks that may adversely impact our sales and results of operations in certain regions 
our ability to capitalize on growth in new international markets and to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations 
these include changes in currency exchange rates which impact the price to international consumers  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and the difficulties associated with promoting products in unfamiliar cultures 

table of contents we are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international sales operations  including political instability  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and general economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets 
any of the abovementioned factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations in international markets 
international trade regulations may impose unexpected duty costs or other non tariff barriers to markets while the increasing number of free trade agreements have the potential to stimulate increased competition 
products manufactured overseas and imported into the us and other countries are subject to import duties 
while we have implemented internal measures to comply with applicable customs regulations and to properly calculate the import duties applicable to imported products  customs authorities may disagree with our claimed tariff treatment for certain products  resulting in unexpected costs that may not have been factored into the sales price of the products 
we cannot predict whether future domestic laws  regulations or trade remedy actions or international agreements may impose additional duties or other restrictions on the importation of products from one or more of our sourcing venues 
such changes could increase the cost of our products  require us to withdraw from certain restricted markets or change our business methods  and could generally make it difficult to obtain products of our customary quality at a desired price 
meanwhile  the continued negotiation of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements by the us and our other market countries with countries other than our principal sourcing venues may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these other sourcing venues  which now export  or may seek to export  footwear to our market countries at preferred rates of duty  though we are uncertain precisely what effect these new agreements may have on our operations 
finally  the increased threat of terrorist activity and the law enforcement responses to this threat have required greater levels of inspection of imported goods and have caused delays in bringing imported goods to market 
any tightening of security procedures  for example  in the aftermath of a terrorist incident  could worsen these delays 
we depend on our computer and communications systems 
we extensively utilize computer and communications systems to operate our internet and catalog business and manage our internal operations 
any interruption of this service from power loss  telecommunications failure  failure of our computer system  failure due to weather  natural disasters or any similar event could disrupt our operations and result in lost sales 
in addition  hackers and computer viruses have disrupted operations at many major companies 
we may be vulnerable to similar acts of sabotage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we rely on our management information systems to operate our business and to track our operating results 
our management information systems will require modification and refinement as we grow and our business needs change 
if we experience a significant system failure or if we are unable to modify our management information systems to respond to changes in our business needs  then our ability to properly run our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents risks related to our industry because the footwear market is sensitive to decreased consumer spending and slow economic cycles  if general economic conditions deteriorate many of our customers may significantly reduce their purchases from us or may not be able to pay for our products when due 
the footwear industry historically has been subject to cyclical variation and decline in performance when consumer spending decreases or softness appears in the retail market 
many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the footwear industry  including general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  weather  taxation  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
consumer purchases of discretionary items  including our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a downturn in economies where we or our licensing partners sell products  whether in the us or abroad  may reduce sales 
in addition  we extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
many retailers  including some of our customers  have experienced financial difficulties during the past several years  thereby increasing the risk that such customers may not be able to pay for our products in a timely manner 
our bad debt expense may increase relative to net sales in the future 
any significant increase in our bad debt expense relative to net sales would adversely impact our net income and cash flow and could affect our ability to pay our own obligations as they become due 
we face intense competition  including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than ours  and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
the footwear industry is highly competitive  and the recent growth in the market for sport sandals  casual footwear and other products manufactured by our licensees has encouraged the entry of many new competitors into the marketplace as well as increased competition from established companies 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technological  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution resources than we do  as well as greater brand awareness in the footwear market 
our competitors include athletic and footwear companies  branded apparel companies and retailers with their own private labels 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry  compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products 
in addition  access to offshore manufacturing has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete  further increasing competition in the footwear industry 
additionally  efforts by our competitors to dispose of their excess inventories may significantly reduce prices that we can expect to receive for the sale of our competing products and may cause our customers to shift their purchases away from our products 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the quality  style and authenticity of our products and the strength of our brands  as well as many factors beyond our control 
maintaining our competitiveness depends on our ability to defend our products from infringement  our continued ability to anticipate and react to consumer tastes and our continued ability to deliver quality products at an acceptable price 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future  our sales and profits will decline  as will the value of our business  financial condition and common stock 

table of contents consolidations  restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry could affect the ability of our wholesale customers to purchase and market our products 
in the future  retailers in the us and in foreign markets may undergo changes that could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the concentration of ownership within the retail industry  including consolidating their operations  undergoing restructurings  undergoing reorganizations  or realigning their affiliations 
these consolidations could result in a shift of bargaining power to the retail industry and in fewer outlets for our products 
further consolidations could result in price and other competition that could reduce our margins and our net sales 
terrorism  government response to terrorism and other world events could affect our ability to do business 
we market and sell our products and services throughout the world 
the september  terrorist attacks disrupted commerce across the us and in many other parts of the world 
world events  including the threat of similar attacks in the future  and the impact of the us s military campaigns may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of new attacks or the resulting response will result in any long term commercial disruptions or do long term harm to our business  results of operations or financial condition 
to the extent that future disruptions further slow the global economy or  more particularly  result in delays or cancellations of purchase orders for our products or delays in shipping  our business and results of operations could suffer material damage 
risks relating to our common stock members of management own sufficient shares to substantially control our company 
at february   doug otto beneficially owned approximately of our common stock and all of our executive officers and directors as a group beneficially owned approximately 
these ownership percentages will be reduced to and if the offering discussed in the following page occurs 
the ownership positions of mr 
otto and our executive officers as a group  together with the anti takeover effects of the delaware general corporation law and provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and our stockholder rights plan  would likely delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company  may deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a change in control and could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
our common stock price has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
while our average daily trading volume for the week period ended february  was approximately  shares  we have experienced more limited volume in the past and may do so in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the closing sale prices of our common stock  as reported by the nasdaq national market  have ranged from to for the week period ended february  the trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to the following changes in expectations of our future performance  changes in estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet such estimates  quarterly fluctuations in our sales and financial results  
table of contents broad market fluctuations in volume and price  and a variety of risk factors  including the ones described elsewhere in this report 
accordingly  the price of our common stock is volatile and any investment in our securities is subject to risk of loss 
we have filed for a public offering of our securities 
on march  we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to sell up to  newly issued shares of common stock and up to  shares of common stock held by selling stockholders not including the overallotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters 
there are no assurances that this offering will be completed or at what price these shares will be sold 
future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price 
future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  we may be required to issue additional shares upon exercise of previously granted options that are currently outstanding 
anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company  even if such a change of control would benefit our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  could discourage  delay or prevent a merger  acquisition or other change in control of our company  even if such a change in control might benefit our stockholders 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
these provisions might also discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer  even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a price above the then current market price for our common stock 
these provisions include the following a board of directors that is classified so that only one third of directors stand for election each year  authorization of blank check preferred stock  which our board of directors could issue with provisions designed to thwart a takeover attempt  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  a prohibition against stockholder action by written consent and a requirement that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we adopted a stockholder rights plan in under a stockholder rights agreement intended to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of our company that do not offer what our board of directors believes to be an adequate price to all stockholders or that our board of directors otherwise opposes 
as part of the plan  our board of directors declared a dividend that resulted in the issuance of one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock for a period of ten years 
if a bidder proceeds with an unsolicited attempt to purchase our stock and acquires or more or announces its intention to acquire or more of our outstanding stock  and the board of directors does not redeem the preferred stock purchase right  the right will become exercisable at a price that significantly dilutes the interest of the bidder in our common stock 

table of contents the effect of the stockholder rights plan is to make it more difficult to acquire our company without negotiating with the board of directors 
however  the stockholder rights plan could discourage offers even if made at a premium over the market price of our common stock  and even if the stockholders might believe the transaction would benefit them 
in addition  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits business combination transactions with or greater stockholders that our board of directors has not approved 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions apply even if some stockholders would consider the transaction beneficial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we no longer utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate as all of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
although our sales are denominated in us currency  our sales may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold 
if the united states dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit and our term loan provide for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit and  outstanding borrowings under the term loan 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have a  impact on income loss before income taxes
