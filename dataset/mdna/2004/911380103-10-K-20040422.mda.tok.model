item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary introduction the executive summary section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a high level summary of the more detailed information elsewhere in this report  an overview to put this information in context and a plan to return the company to long term profitability 
this section is also an introduction to the discussion and analysis that follows 
accordingly  it necessarily omits details that appear elsewhere in this report 
it should not be relied upon separately from the balance of this report 
products and purchasing the company is a leading specialty retailer featuring its proprietary avenue brand large size or larger women s wearing apparel 
it also offers avenue body brand large size women s undergarments and lingerie  cloudwalkers brand women s footwear and avenue brand large size women s hosiery  as well as avenue brand accessories and gifts 
most of the company s products are made for the company by contract manufacturing abroad 
customer base the company serves the mass market in the united states and targets fashion conscious women between and years of age who wear large size apparel 
management believes that the number of women in this age range who wear large size apparel has increased in recent years 
merchandising and marketing design is an important aspect of the company s products 
many avenue and avenue body products are custom designed 
the company emphasizes a contemporary brand image and consistency of merchandise quality and fit 
the company uses direct mail  credit card statement inserts  in store signage and e mail messages in its marketing activities 
channel of distribution the company s channel of distribution is retail stores using its avenue trade name 
it leases stores in states 
the company also operates a website at www 
avenue 
com that sells a selection of the merchandise that is also on sale in the stores 
until march  the company also mailed catalogs that featured a merchandise selection that included both items in the stores and similar products 
the website and the catalog  while it was in existence  are referred to as the shop home business 
the more diverse merchandise assortment and disparate cash flows of the catalog operation compared with the stores led management to treat the shop home business as a separate channel of distribution in fiscal and fiscal increased competition the women s retail apparel and shoe industries are highly competitive 
operating results of businesses in these industries  especially businesses that emphasize fashionable merchandise  can vary materially from year to year 
the company s competition includes other specialty retailers  mass merchants  department stores  discount stores  mail order companies  television shopping channels and internet websites 
management believes that total sales of large size women s apparel from these sources of supply increased in recent years 
among specialty retailers for large size women like the company  the competition includes large store chains that have announced long term store growth plans to aggressively expand into additional strip shopping center locations 
deflationary price trend in apparel industry the consumer price index published by the us dept 
of labor  bureau of labor statistics city average for women s and girls apparel the cpi declined in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal there is no assurance that this deflationary trend will not continue 
company sales fluctuations sales figures and merchandise margins are central to the company s profitability 
the company conducts a weekly interdisciplinary review of sales and merchandise margins and prepares budgets for two six month seasons each year  the spring season and the fall season 
management uses comparable store sales for stores open at least months at the time as a management tool 
however  there is no industry standard for calculating comparable store sales and the company s approach may differ from those of competitors 
seasonal sales and cpi data follows spring fall spring fall spring fall total store sales millions sales per average store s average number of stores comparable store sales six month cpi excluding shop home sales us dept

the company had net income of million in fiscal and incurred net losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company had operating income of million in fiscal and incurred operating losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal excluding a one time goodwill write off  the operating loss in fiscal was million 
in order to return to long term profitability  it will be necessary for the company to increase sales per average store with merchandise margins at levels equal to  or better than  fiscal product repositioning plan in the women s retail specialty apparel industry  sales  especially in businesses that emphasize fashionable merchandise  can vary significantly over time 
sales are volatile because of shifts in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  variations in weather patterns  fluctuations in consumer acceptance of the company s products  changes in the ability to develop new merchandise  differences in promotional strategies  and movements in consumer confidence levels 
these variables caused the company s sales per average store to fluctuate in the past 
thus  recent sales performance is not necessarily indicative of future sales performance 
as a result  management believes that long term sales projections within a defined narrow range are not reliable 
after fiscal  when net income declined to million  the company incurred net losses 
the company has sought to return to long term profitability through higher sales per average store with merchandise margins at levels equal to  or better than  fiscal these financial goals were translated into an integrated operational plan early in fiscal this plan has four principal components i to improve the design of the company s merchandise and thereby differentiate it from competitors merchandise  ii to market more items together as coordinated outfits rather than separately as individual garments  iii to put more emphasis on fashionable merchandise and less on basic items  and iv to raise the level of merchandise presentation in the store to make shopping easier and to encourage outfit buying 
this plan relies primarily on the company s intellectual capital 
only small amounts of financial capital are required to execute the plan

fluctuation in store count store counts averaged  and  respectively  for fiscal  and in  the company opened five stores and closed stores 
in  the company is planning to open two stores and close approximately stores as part of its normal lease maintenance program 
thus  the average number of stores is expected to decline further in fiscal the annual capital expenditure budgets after fiscal will provide for new store construction and other infrastructure development priorities 
prioritization will be based  among other things  on overall profitability and the availability of suitable locations at rents and on terms that fit the company s financial model for new store construction 
liquidity united retail group  inc and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  the companies are parties to a financing agreement  dated august   as amended the financing agreement  with the cit group business credit  inc cit 
the financing agreement provides credit on a revolving basis 
the company s historical sources of liquidity have been the availability of credit under the financing agreement on a revolving basis and short term trade credit  as well as its cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities 
management believes that these sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to meet the company s cash requirements for months after the date of this report 
the preceding sentence constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
in the event the company s operating loss increases materially from fiscal levels  additional sources of liquidity might be required 
the company s cash requirements include i anticipated working capital needs  including seasonal inventory financing  ii financing activities  including payments due on its principal contractual obligations and iii investing activities  including costs for building the stores that it plans to open  renovating certain other stores and replacing fixtures where appropriate

see  suspension of catalog operations 
gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal but increased as a percentage of net sales to from 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased principally because of lower marketing costs resulting from the suspension of catalog mailings and higher merchandise margins 
the decline in marketing costs and increase in merchandise margins were partially offset by an increase in rent and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales  which occurred because net sales declined at a faster rate than rent and occupancy costs

liquidity and capital resources this section provides details about the company s sources of liquidity 
cash flow net cash provided from operating activities increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted principally from a larger decrease in inventory million in fiscal versus million in fiscal and a smaller net loss million in fiscal versus million  which included a million goodwill write off  in fiscal 
these items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses a decrease of million in fiscal versus an increase of million in fiscal 
the decrease in inventory in fiscal was planned but no further decrease is planned for fiscal inventory levels may rise  instead  depending on business trends 
the company s net income loss is generally a more important variable in net cash provided from operating activities than changes in items on the balance sheets 
balance sheet sources of liquidity the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at january  compared with million at february  during fiscal  a planned decrease in inventories was implemented 
inventories were stated at million at january  compared with million at february  principally as a result of fewer units 
see  critical accounting policies inventory for a discussion of estimates made by management in stating inventories in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
property and equipment decreased to million at january  from million at february  principally from depreciation 
other liquidity sources import purchases by the company are made in us dollars 
imports are generally financed by trade letters of credit 
they constituted approximately of total purchases in fiscal the financing agreement was extended and expanded during fiscal the term was extended three years to august  the line of credit was increased from million to million for the companies  subject to availability of credit as described in the following paragraphs 
the line of credit may be used on a revolving basis by any of the companies to support trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit and to finance loans 
at january   trade letters of credit for the account of the companies and supported by cit were outstanding in the amount of million and standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of million 
standby letters of credit were used principally in connection with insurance policies issued to the company 
subject to the following paragraph  the availability of credit within the aggregate million line of credit to any of the companies at any time is the excess of its borrowing base over the sum of x the aggregate outstanding amount of its letters of credit and its revolving loans  if any  and y at cit s option  the sum of i unpaid sales taxes  and ii up to  in total liabilities of the companies under permitted encumbrances as defined in the financing agreement 
the borrowing base  as to any of the companies  is the sum of x a percentage of the book value of its eligible inventory both on hand and unfilled purchase orders financed with letters of credit  ranging from to depending on the time of year  y the balance from time to time in an account in its name that has been pledged to the lenders a pledged account and z of certain receivables from credit card companies 
the provisions of the preceding paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding  the companies are required to maintain unused at all times combined availability of at least million 
except for the maintenance of a minimum availability of million and a limit on capital expenditures  the financing agreement does not contain any financial covenants 
the combined borrowing capacity of the companies is cyclical due to the seasonality of the retail industry 
at january   the combined borrowing capacity of the companies  after satisfying the million minimum availability requirement  was million  the pledged account had a zero balance  the companies cash on hand was unrestricted  and no loan was outstanding 
the line of credit is collateralized by a security interest in inventory and proceeds and receivables from credit card companies and by the balance from time to time in the pledged account 
the financing agreement includes certain restrictive covenants that impose limitations subject to certain exceptions on the companies with respect to making certain investments  declaring or paying dividends  making loans  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  or consolidating  merging or making acquisitions outside the ordinary course of business 
in fiscal  the company drew on the revolving loan facility under the financing agreement from time to time to meet its peak working capital requirements 
interest is payable monthly based on a day year either at the prime rate plus an incremental percentage up to per annum or at the libor rate plus an incremental percentage ranging from to per annum 
the borrower can select either the prime rate or the libor rate as the basis for determining the interest rate 
in either case  the incremental percentage is determined by the average excess availability 
the company s obligation to pay customs duties on merchandise imports was collateralized by an unsecured surety bond for million during fiscal the tightening market for surety bonds has made it necessary for the company to support the surety bond with a standby letter of credit under the financing agreement in the amount of million 
short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for domestic merchandise purchases 
trade credit arises from the willingness of the company s domestic vendors to grant extended payment terms for inventory purchases and is generally financed either by the vendor or a third party factor 
the availability of trade credit depends on the company s having other sources of liquidity  as well 
in particular  credit authorizations by trade creditors focus on the amount of the company s cash and cash equivalents and its borrowing capacity under the financing agreement 
in november  the company agreed in principle with the internal revenue service irs on the settlement of tax refund claims the company had filed 
although only a preliminary settlement has been reached with the irs  in april  the company received from the irs million which includes million representing interest 
however  the company has not yet received a formally authorized and executed closing agreement with the irs 
upon receipt of a closing agreement  the company will recognize the benefit of the refund  including the related interest 
it is anticipated the million refund will be recorded as an increase to stockholders equity 
the million interest payment will be recorded in the company s results of operations 
an additional refund estimated to be million is also expected 
capital expenditures this section and the one that follows provide details about certain uses of cash by the company 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  principally because the company opened only five new stores in fiscal compared with stores during fiscal capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million for fiscal  including implementation of the company s product repositioning plan 
this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
principal contractual obligations and certain other commercial commitments the principal contractual obligations of the company and certain other commercial commitments at january  see  also critical accounting policies incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits are summarized in the following charts payments due by period s omitted principal contractual obligations total payments due s omitted less than year years years over years fixture capital leases    distribution center mortgage    call center systems capital lease total     amount of commitment per period s omitted certain other commercial commitments total amounts committed s omitted less than year years years over years operating leases      trade letters of credit   standby letters of credit   total      the proceeds of the fixture capital leases were principally used to partially finance new store construction in fiscal the proceeds of the distribution center mortgage were principally used to partially finance the construction cost of the company s national distribution center  which was completed in fiscal trade letters of credit support company obligations under certain purchase orders for merchandise imports for which payment is not yet due 
other purchase orders represent material commercial obligations but are not supported by trade letters of credit 
pending litigation the company is involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes based on advice of legal counsel that such litigation and claims  net of reserves  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  on may   a suit in california superior court  los angeles county  styled erik stanford vs 
united retail incorporated was served on the company by a former store manager in california 
on march   an amended complaint was served that added another plaintiff 
the suit is purportedly a class action on behalf of certain current and former associates in california in the previous four years 
the plaintiffs in the stanford case assert state wage and hour claims 
the company intends to oppose class certification strongly and to defend the stanford case vigorously on the merits 
although counsel is unable at this early stage to predict the ultimate outcome of the stanford case  management does not believe that the case will have a material impact on the company s financial position 
however  given the uncertainty at this stage  it is possible that if either an adverse judgment for damages is rendered or a negotiated settlement is agreed upon  the amount payable could be material to the company s annual results of operations or cash flows 
meeting cash requirements the company s cash requirements include i anticipated working capital needs  including seasonal inventory financing  ii financing activities  including payments due on its principal contractual obligations and iii investing activities  including costs for building the stores that it plans to open  renovating certain other stores and replacing fixtures where appropriate 
during fiscal  the company funded net cash used in investing activities  repayments of long term debt and payments on capital lease obligations from net cash provided from operating activities and a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
the company s historical sources of liquidity have been the availability of credit under the financing agreement on a revolving basis and short term trade credit  as well as its cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities 
management believes that these sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate for months after the date of this report to meet the company s cash requirements 
in the women s retail specialty apparel industry  operating results of businesses  especially businesses that emphasize fashionable merchandise  can vary significantly over time because of shifts in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  variations in weather patterns  fluctuations in consumer acceptance of the company s products  and changes in the ability to develop new merchandise 
in the event the company s operating loss increases materially from fiscal levels  additional sources of liquidity might be required 
this section constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
critical accounting policies introduction this section discusses the company s critical accounting policies 
financial statements prepared by companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are affected by the policies followed by management in preparing them 
some accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by corporate management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
among the most important accounting policies of the company that involve such management judgments are i the use of the retail method of accounting for inventory  ii the use of estimates of incurred but not reported claims for uninsured damages for personal injuries  for self insured workers compensation benefits and for benefits under the company s self insured medical  dental and prescription plans for its associates  as well as future development costs of reported claims collectively  ibnr claims and iii determining whether to continue the valuation allowance for the company s net deferred tax assets  including nol s 
inventory in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company utilizes the retail method  under which a cost to price relationship is developed on the basis of original cost as compared to initial retail selling price 
the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting margins are calculated by applying this cost to price relationship to the retail value of inventories 
consequently  the use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market 
inherent in the retail inventory method are management estimates on current and future selling value of the inventory 
these estimates  which are described in the following paragraphs  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting margins 
in the women s retail specialty apparel industry  sales  especially in businesses that emphasize fashionable merchandise  can vary significantly over time 
sales are volatile because of shifts in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of competition and pricing  variations in weather patterns  fluctuations in consumer acceptance of the company s products  changes in the ability to develop new merchandise  differences in promotional strategies  and movements in consumer confidence levels 
the necessity for management estimates based on these variables  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can produce inventory valuations at any point in time that are inexact 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the price and cost components of inventory on hand  which maintains the established cost to price relationship 
deferred markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventories under the lower of cost or market principle 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  management conducts a thorough review of inventory on hand 
based on management s business judgment  the company may reduce further the carrying value of inventories by recording a markdown reserve 
markdown reserves are established for inventory categories with sales performance below expectations and or unsold quantities in excess of expectations 
at the end of each fiscal year  management estimates what quantities of current merchandise are in excess of the amounts saleable at historical margin rates 
a markdown reserve is established to reduce the carrying value of excess current merchandise to estimated net realizable value 
also  a markdown reserve is established by management to reduce the carrying value of obsolete categories of merchandise to their estimated net realizable value 
the markdown reserves at the end of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  ranged from a low of million to a high of million  with fiscal at the low end of the range 
giving effect to these reserves  inventories were stated at approximately million at january   million at february  and million at february  year end markdown reserves are likely to continue to fluctuate  principally because the market environment is dynamic for the reasons set forth above 
recording a reserve reduces the inventory on the company s balance sheet and is charged to the company s cost of sales 
if inventories  net of reserves  were overestimated at the end of a period  assets and income for that period would be overstated and margins for the beginning of the next period would come in lower 
the opposite would be true if inventories were underestimated 
management believes that the inventories shown on the balance sheets at january  and february  included in the financial statements contained in this report were properly stated in all material respects 
further  margins in the first fiscal quarter subsequent to the february  balance sheet were well within normal historical ranges  indicating that the inventory valuation at february  was estimated properly 
incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company records a liability for ibnr claims 
this liability is based on i the number and size of outstanding claims  ii a comparison between the dates paid claims were incurred and the dates they were paid  iii an analysis of the amounts previously paid  iv projections of inflation in medical costs and v advice from time to time from its insurance broker 
the company has insurance policies with coverage for personal injury claims but it remains liable for a self insured retention  which is collateralized by standby letters of credit under the financing agreement 
the company is self insured for most workers compensation benefits and for its medical  dental and prescription plans for associates but it has stop loss insurance policies to limit its liability 
the estimates underlying the liability for ibnr claims are matters of judgment on which insurance experts may differ 
if the outcome of claims made with respect to a fiscal period were to exceed the recorded ibnr liability for that period  the liabilities on the balance sheet would have been understated and income would have been overstated for the period in question 
the opposite would be true if the subsequent outcome were less than the recorded ibnr liability 
as the use of different estimates would change the ibnr liability recorded materially  a consistent approach to estimating liability for ibnr claims is one of the company s important accounting objectives 
management believes that the liabilities for ibnr claims reflected in the balance sheets at january  and february  included in the financial statements contained in this report were fairly stated in all material respects  subject to the uncertainties of litigation and the risk of different than anticipated inflation in medical costs 
tax valuation allowance in fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to establish a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
the tax valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which places significant importance on the company s cumulative operating results in the most recent three year period when assessing the need for a tax valuation allowance 
in fiscal  the tax valuation allowance was increased by million 
the company intends to maintain a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets until management determines that sufficient positive evidence regarding operating results exists to support reversal of the allowance remaining at that time 
a reversal of the tax valuation allowance would improve the company s net income loss 
accordingly  whether to continue a tax valuation allowance is one of the company s important accounting matters 
private label credit cards issued by the bank the company and world financial network national bank the bank are parties to a private label credit card program agreement  dated january  as amended  the credit card program agreement 
under the credit card program agreement  the bank issues credit cards to eligible company customers who apply to the bank 
net credit sales volume with the bank increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal customers must meet standards for creditworthiness set by the bank with the approval of the company  provided  however  that the bank shall take any actions required to prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices 
the credit cards issued by the bank are co branded with both the company s avenue service mark and the bank s name 
the credit cards are used only for merchandise and services offered by the company 
credit card holders remit payments to the bank  generally by mailing personal checks 
the bank also handles all statement processing  payment processing  cardholder customer service and collections from delinquent cardholders 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company does not include the receivable asset created under the credit card program agreement in the company s accounts receivable on its balance sheets because the company has no interest in the customer accounts or receivables 
in this connection  it should be noted that the credit card program agreement states that i the bank is the sole and exclusive owner of all customer accounts  ii the company has no interest in the customer accounts and iii the bank is the creditor in respect of receivables defined in the credit card program agreement as amounts owed with respect to retail purchases  finance charges  deferred finance charges  other fees and charges for sales tax 
also  depending on the circumstances  the company might not purchase the accounts from the bank upon the expiration of the contractual term 
the credit card program agreement is currently scheduled to expire on february  the company shall then have the right to purchase the customer accounts from the bank for a price equal to the receivables 
also  the bank shall then have the right to sell the customer accounts to the company at that price if the company commences a private label credit card program either on its own or through another issuer of credit cards 
when the credit card program agreement is about to expire without being renewed  the company is likely to submit requests for proposals to other banks that issue private label credit cards to retailers customers and to use the banks proposals to evaluate a continuation of the private label credit card program 
there is no assurance  however  that other banks would make proposals to continue the program on terms satisfactory to the company or that the company could finance a program on its own without involving a bank 
receivables as defined in the credit card program agreement at the close of the last billing cycle in the year were million at both january  and february  the credit card program premium or  potentially  discount reflected in general  administrative and store operating expenses is an amount equal to royalties paid to the company by the bank minus costs charged by the bank 
costs are based on the volume of credit card program processing activities performed by the bank 
general  administrative and store operating expenses were offset in part by premiums received from the bank of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in premiums from the bank was primarily due to an increase in customer fees paid to the bank 
royalties are based on program revenues minus receivables written off by the bank and the cost of funds for the program 
for up to the first million of receivables  cost of funds means the one year constant maturities treasury cmt rate plus basis points to be reset every three months the published cmt rate was per annum at january  
however  the cmt rate shall not be more than per annum and not be less than per annum for the purpose of this calculation 
the bank s receivables for the program were less than million at january   but  if they grew larger than that amount  the cost of funds for the excess would be based primarily on the cost of borrowing of a trust for the purpose of securitizing receivables 
stores the company s channel of distribution is retail stores using its avenue trade name 
the company leased stores at april  store counts averaged  and  respectively  for fiscal  and in  the company opened five stores and closed stores 
in  the company is planning to open two stores and close approximately stores as part of its normal lease maintenance program 
thus  the average number of stores is expected to decline further in fiscal this paragraph includes forward looking information under the reform act  which is subject to the uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
the annual capital expenditure budgets after fiscal will provide for new store construction and other infrastructure development priorities 
prioritization will be based  among other things  on overall profitability and the availability of suitable locations at rents and on terms that fit the company s financial model for new store construction 
retail selling space was approximately million square feet at january  and million square feet at february  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment relate principally to assets in stores and were million in fiscal and million in fiscal e commerce the company has an internet site www 
avenue 
com that sells a selection of the merchandise that is also for sale in the company s stores 
the company ships it avenue 
com orders from its national distribution center in troy  ohio 
sales on the website have not been material to the company s operations 
suspension of catalog operations the company mailed catalogs until march  when the company suspended catalog mailings indefinitely 
stock repurchases the company did not repurchase shares of its own stock in fiscal the company has no plans to repurchase shares of its own stock at present except with trust funds under the company s supplemental retirement savings plan to satisfy obligations that may arise under that plan to invest a portion of participants accounts in company stock 
corporate acquisition reviews as a matter of routine  the company from time to time conducts due diligence reviews of businesses that are either for sale as a going concern or are in liquidation 
the company would consider making a bid on a suitable corporate acquisition at an opportune price if adequate financing at acceptable rates were available
