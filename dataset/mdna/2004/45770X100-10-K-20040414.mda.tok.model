item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data section  our consolidated financial statements and the information described in the business important factors that may affect our business  our operating results and our stock price section included elsewhere in this report 
description of the company we provide enterprises with scalable data analysis solutions consisting of software and services designed to facilitate decision making by revealing patterns  trends and relationships 
we are a supplier of these software and services for the statistical analysis  data mining and knowledge access industry segments enabling customers to gain intelligence from numerical data and text 
our products include s plus r  statserver r  s plus analytic server r  insightful miner  and infact r 
our consulting services provide specialized expertise and proven processes for the design  development and deployment of analytical solutions 
we have been delivering data analysis solutions for years to companies in financial services  pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  telecommunications and manufacturing as well as government and research institutions 
headquartered in seattle  washington  we also have north american offices in new york and north carolina 
our international offices are located in france  switzerland  and the united kingdom  with distributors around the world 
business outlook we provide our customers with useful and innovative software and services to derive intelligence from the data they collect 
several converging trends point to a significant long term potential for the data analysis software market 
first  organizations currently collect far more data  in a variety of formats  than they actually analyze 
second  increasing amounts of additional information are being collected by organizations 
third  organizations are seeking to apply new and increasingly complex analytic techniques to their ever increasing collection of data in order to gain significant improvements in the quality and efficacy of products built  marketed  and sold and to improvements in the efficiency of business processes 
overall  the confluence of these trends should result in significant long term potential for data analysis software companies such as insightful 
our product direction for the s plus product family mirrors these data analysis industry trends 
our focus has been  and will continue to be  to build on s plus position as a leader for statistical model prototyping and data visualization used extensively by individual statisticians building statistical models 
our vision is to continually enhance the s plus product family to provide a seamless environment where sophisticated business analytics can be developed on the desktop and then deployed to production on servers handling many gigabytes of data and deployed to hundreds and even thousands of users  without the need for expensive re implementation 
we will increasingly enable s plus programmers and other it professionals to use the s plus product family to deploy analytic applications to mission critical production environments 
our direction also involves tailoring our solutions to meet the needs of certain market segments 
throughout our history  we have  to varying degrees  tailored our data analysis solutions to the needs of the following industries securities and banking  life sciences  manufacturing  telecommunications  environmental  and defense intelligence 
our largest efforts have focused on life sciences and financial services 
we also serve the academic community  though our objective there is not to drive short term increased revenues but rather seed for future commercial sales 
since we are seeing more of our customers explore and adopt open source data analysis technologies  instead of purchasing commercial software products  our direction involves extending our products to provide increasing value add in the form of scaling to large amounts of data as well as tailored to specific vertical markets 
we are focusing our resources on higher value initiatives in the three industries that currently account for the majority of our revenues life sciences  securities and banking for data analysis  and defense intelligence 
we will continue to invest in both our existing and new products  as well as in expanding our sales and marketing efforts 
we anticipate that our growth will primarily be driven by software license revenues and that our professional services revenue will remain flat or even decline somewhat 
growth for our software license and maintenance revenues will be driven primarily by our high end products  insightful miner  s plus server  and our vertical application modules such as s finmetrics and s array analyzer 
review of accounting practices on  march   we filed a form b notification of late filing with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the filing of this annual report  and disclosed that during the audit process  management made our independent auditors aware of specific allegations made by a former employee who was terminated in the first quarter of  and who filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination against us in december in an april deposition  the former employee alleged  among other things  that we improperly recognized services revenues in and while we had performed an internal review of the specific allegations made in the deposition in april and may of  our independent auditors recommended further review of the projects identified in the deposition and recommended that management perform additional analysis to satisfy itself that the consolidated financial statements are fairly presented for the entire audit period 
accordingly  we delayed the filing of this annual report in order to allow time to complete an independent investigation of the projects identified in the deposition 
the investigation efforts were directed by the audit committee of our board  and carried out by our outside law firm with our full cooperation 
based on the investigation  our audit committee has determined  with the advice of management  that our financial statements for the and years  and for the quarters included therein  present fairly  in all material respects  the consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  intangible assets  restructuring  asset impairment  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenues are a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed in note of the financial statements  in measuring revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from three sources license revenues  which consist of software license fees  maintenance revenues  consisting of fees for maintenance and support  and professional services revenues  which are comprised of fees for consulting and training 
the revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex and require our management to exercise judgment and make a number of estimates 
for example  many of our contracts contain multiple element arrangements  which require us to make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each element  to determine if undelivered elements are deemed essential  and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
we also evaluate whether there is any material risk of customer non payment or product returns 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
revenue that we cannot recognize in a particular period is reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized over time as the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
these estimates are made based upon all of the information available to us at the time 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period if different judgments are made or different estimates are used 
sales returns we provide an estimated reserve for return rights at the time of sale 
we offer our customers a day return policy on all of our products 
refunds are provided to customers upon return to us of the complete product package  including all original materials  cd rom or other media 
our provision for sales returns is estimated based on historical returns experience and our judgment of future return risk 
bad debts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated taking into consideration past experience  current economic conditions  aging of the amounts  and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
customer credit worthiness is subject to many business and finance risks facing each customer and is subject to sudden changes 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets at least annually we evaluate goodwill arising from acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and expected future operational performance of our acquired businesses 
in we recorded an  impairment of goodwill and in we recorded an additional  impairment based upon our estimates of the discounted future cash flows of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that additional impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired business is impaired 
impairment losses will be charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified 
we will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment and  should an impairment be indicated  the corresponding charge will be taken in that period 
separable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
contingencies we are engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of possible losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves if any  may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter 
discontinued operations on january   we sold the operations of our engineering and education products division  or eepd  for cash proceeds of  resulting in a gain of  recorded in  and a  gain recorded in components of the net aggregate gain are included in the table below 
as of december   other accrued liabilities included approximately  related to a contingency resulting from the disposition 
the contingency was resolved favorably during reducing other accrued liabilities from  to  and income taxes from  to  resulting in a gain of cash proceeds 















 net assets transferred 











 employee severance and termination benefits 
 transaction costs 













 other accrued liabilities 









 taxes 



















 income from discontinued operations 


 the loss from discontinued operations consist of eepd s revenues of  offset by costs and expenses of  for the period through january   the date of disposition 
the loss recorded in related to previously unidentified third party contractual commitments of eepd 
the amounts were not material to the periods in which they applied  primarily and we believe that all significant contingencies relating to the discontinued operations have now been resolved 
acquisitions in july  we completed the acquisition of a data analysis consulting business from waratah corporation 
this acquisition provides us with expanded resources and expertise in the pharmaceutical and healthcare markets  while establishing an east coast consulting office 
the aggregate purchase price of  consisted of  cash  common stock valued at  a common stock warrant valued at  and direct transaction costs of  the value of the  shares of common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over a three day period before and after the date of acquisition 
the warrant to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price of  and expiring on july  was valued using the black scholes model 
we recorded an intangible asset for the value allocated to non compete agreements of  which was amortized on a straight line basis over a two year period  representing the expected life of the non compete agreements that we acquired 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of  has been recorded as goodwill 
in july  we also completed the formation of a french subsidiary and acquired the data analysis operations of sigma plus  our longtime distributor in france 
the formation of a french subsidiary provided us with an expanded direct sales channel and local consulting expertise in both paris and toulouse 
the aggregate purchase price of  consisted of  cash and direct transaction costs of  we recorded an intangible asset for the value allocated to non compete agreements of  which were amortized on a straight line basis over a two year period  representing the expected life of the non compete agreements that we acquired 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of  was recorded as goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  when we performed our annual impairment analysis  we determined that a loss from impairment of goodwill of  was indicated based on our updated assumptions for future cash flows 
this analysis resulted in the write down of all goodwill originally recorded in this transaction 
in september  we completed the acquisition of predict ag predict 
this acquisition provided us with a multi lingual professional services team consisting of a multi lingual team of business and technical experts in analytic crm  business intelligence  data mining  data warehousing  predictive modeling  and statistical analysis 
the organization has also formed the core team for our central european office  which focuses primarily on switzerland and germany 
the aggregate consideration paid was  consisting of  cash  common stock valued at  and direct transaction costs of  the value of the  shares of common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over a three day period before and after the date of acquisition 
we recorded intangible assets for the value allocated to non compete agreements and customer relationships totaling  which were amortized on a straight line basis over a two year period  representing the expected life of the non compete agreements that we acquired 
we recorded  for the value allocated to deferred stock based compensation in connection with restrictions on  shares of common stock otherwise issuable as part of the acquisition  which was being amortized over a three year vesting period using a graded vesting approach 
however  in the first quarter of  our european general manager resigned prior to the expiration of the restriction on his shares 
consequently  these shares were returned to us and related stock based compensation expense recognized in previous periods was reversed resulting in a reduction in sales and marketing expense of  in as of december   all employees in receipt of restricted stock had terminated 
the difference between the purchase price for predict ag and the fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of  was recorded as goodwill 
during the continued decline in the market for it software and services prompted a re assessment of all key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation judgments  including those related to short and longer term growth rates 
in the fourth quarter of  using an october  measurement date  we performed our annual impairment analysis and determined that a loss from impairment of goodwill of  was required 
this resulted primarily from a decline in the service revenues for our swiss operations due to weak economic conditions  which caused the forecasted undiscounted cash flows to be less than the book value of predict 
in the fourth quarter of  when we next performed our annual impairment analysis  we determined that an additional loss of  was indicated based on our updated assumptions for future cash flows  which reflected reduced growth rates based on our economic outlook for that region 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support our intangible assets may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in january  we acquired the data analysis operations of gras graphische systeme gmbh  or gras  our longtime distributor in germany 
the transaction provided us with an expanded direct sales channel in germany 
consideration for the acquisition was cash of  we recorded an intangible asset for the value allocated to customer relationships of  which was amortized on a straight line basis over a two year period  representing the expected life of the customer relationships that we acquired 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of  was recorded as goodwill 
in july  we combined our german operations with our swiss subsidiary headquartered in basel  switzerland and closed the german office 
at that time we evaluated the goodwill acquired in the acquisition of our german and swiss businesses for impairment and determined that none had occurred 
the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions is not subject to amortization  but is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment 
the results of gras  predict  waratah and sigma plus have been included in our operating results since their respective acquisition dates

revenues total revenues consist of software license  software maintenance  and professional services revenues 
total revenues decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and increased to  in  an increase of from software license revenues  consisting of software licenses and subscriptions  accounted for of total revenues in  in and in software license revenues decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and increased to  in  an increase of 
the decrease was primarily due to dampened demand caused by the economic slowdown  which adversely affected corporate spending on information technology in many of the industries we serve 
the increase was primarily due to increased european license revenues  primarily as a result of positive fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  and an increase in revenues from infact  for which we first recognized revenue in the fourth quarter of software maintenance revenues accounted for of total revenues in  in and in software maintenance revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and to  in  an increase of 
these increases were due to an increase in our installed base and ongoing maintenance renewals 
professional services revenues generated from consulting and training activities decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and to  in  a decrease of from in the revenue decrease in professional services was primarily due to generally weak economic conditions  resulting in fewer available projects at which time we reduced our consulting headcount  particularly in our swiss office 
in the revenue decrease was primarily due to fewer consulting projects in switzerland and north america and we further reduced our consulting headcount 
we expect professional services revenues to continue to decrease in as we focus on aligning our services with software license sale opportunities 
revenues from international operations  which include europe and asia pacific  increased from  in to  in  an increase of  to  in  an increase of 
the increase resulted from our international expansion through acquisition  resulting in the formation of a french subsidiary in july  a swiss subsidiary in september and a german subsidiary in january the purpose of the company s aggressive expansion in europe was to enhance growth and reduce our exposure to the north american economy 
the increase was primarily the result of increased software license revenue partially offset by lower professional service revenues  particularly in switzerland 
most of the increase in revenues from international operations was attributable to positive fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we expect our license and maintenance revenues to grow in  subject to the successful launch of new products and continued worldwide economic recovery  as we continue to increase our sales and marketing resources 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of from the and decrease in total cost of revenues was primarily due to decreases in professional service costs offset somewhat in by an increase in the cost of software related revenue 
the cost of software related revenue  which consists of royalties for third party software  product media  product duplication  manuals and costs of maintenance  decreased as a percentage of total software related revenues from in  to in  and to in the decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of products with royalty costs while the decrease was primarily due to revenue growth exceeding the growth in costs of software licenses 
until january  we were a worldwide licensee of the s programming language from lucent technologies inc under the license  we had the right to use  sublicense and support the s language in exchange for royalties  which are included in the cost of software licenses 
in january we acquired the copyrights to the software code underlying the s programming language for million resulting in a cessation of future royalty payments to lucent technologies 
we expect that the cost of software related revenue will decrease primarily as the result of a decrease in royalty costs due to the january lucent technologies agreement  offset somewhat by the amortization cost of the copyright intangible asset which is being amortized over a three year period 
the cost of professional services consists primarily of salaries  and other operating costs of employees who provide consulting services and product training 
the cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenues increased from in  to in and to in the and increases were primarily due to decreases in professional services revenue partially offset by the reduction of professional services expenses  which lagged the related revenue decrease 
we expect the cost of professional services to fluctuate with changes in service revenues and for our services margin to gradually improve as utilization of existing resources grow 
we expect that the reductions in professional services personnel that we implemented during our restructuring in mid will help us improve our service margins 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  facilities costs for sales and marketing personnel  promotional activities  and costs of advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing increased from  in to  in  an increase of from  and to  in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in and decreased to in the increase in over was primarily due to the addition of our french  swiss and german subsidiaries 
the decrease in was primarily due to the closing of our german office in july and reduction in workforce in our swiss office 
in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we allocate more resources to that area  but to remain flat as a percentage of total revenues 
net research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  equipment for software developers  facility costs  and payments to outside contractors  less funded research 
net research and development expenses increased from  in to  in  an increase  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
net research and development increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  and decreased to in gross research and development expenses increased from  in to  in  a increase  and decreased to  in in the increase research and development costs was primarily due to an increased investment in new product offerings  such as insightful miner and infact  and to a decrease in funded research 
in  the decrease was primarily attributable to workforce reductions implemented in july and july funded research  which consists primarily of government grants for research projects  decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
the change in funded research is attributable to the number of awarded contracts as well as to a more focused approach of aligning research funding with our core products 
we expect our net research and development expenses to increase due to both a reduction in funded research as well as through additional hiring of development personnel 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with finance  accounting  investor relations  human resources  administration and facilities activities 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in  an increase of less than  and increased to  in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in and to in the increase was attributable to continuing increases in insurance  legal  compliance and audit expenses 
we expect future increases in general and administrative expenses relating to continuing increases in legal  compliance and audit expenses 
in late we uncovered a theft by an employee and launched an internal investigation to determine the extent of the loss 
as a result of our investigation  we determined that the theft had occurred over a period of several years 
we ultimately concluded that while there was no material impact on earnings in any period  approximately  of expense in each of and needed to be reclassified to general and administrative expense from several other cost and expense categories 
as part of our internal controls review  we have implemented controls to reduce the risk of this type of incident reoccurring 
amortization of stock based compensation expense consists of amounts related to common stock issued in acquisitions  which were subject to cancellation in the event of employee termination 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  in   in and  in in addition  in  our european general manager resigned prior to the expiration of the restriction on his shares 
consequently  in these shares were returned to us and related stock based compensation expense recognized in previous periods was reversed resulting in a reversal of previously recognized deferred stock based compensation expense of  and a reduction of deferred stock based compensation of  in  stock based compensation expense was included in the functional operating expense categories as follows  for sales and marketing   for cost of professional services revenues  and  for research and development 
in  stock based compensation expense of  was included in sales and marketing   in cost of professional services revenues  and  in research and development 
in  the net stock based compensation expense credit of  was included in sales and marketing 
the credit is the result of  in deferred stock compensation expense previously recognized being reversed due to the return of restricted shares issued in the acquisition of predict ag  offset by deferred stock compensation expense of  in  we recorded a loss from impairment of  resulting from a write down of the carrying value of goodwill for predict ag as computed under fas in we recorded an additional loss from impairment of  consisting of a  write down of the carrying value of goodwill for predict ag and a  write down of the carrying value of goodwill for sigma plus 
the impairment was due to the continued decline in the market for it software and services from the september date of acquisition of predict and to our july restructuring  which resulted in the termination of nearly of the headcount in our swiss office 
the impairment was the result of a decrease in the discounted future cash flows from our french and swiss subsidiaries as computed under fas caused by a reduction in our revenue growth expectations based on our economic outlook for that region 
restructuring related charges in november  july and july we implemented workforce reductions in order to better align our costs with our revenues 
the restructuring expense totaled  and resulted from the reduction of approximately employees  or of our employee base at the time 
all of the restructuring charge related our domestic data analysis segment 
as of december   all severance and termination benefits related to this workforce reduction were paid 
the restructuring expense totaled  and resulted from a workforce reduction of employees  or of our employee base at the time 
of the  restructuring charge   related to our international data analysis segment and the remaining  was attributable to our domestic data analysis segment 
all of the restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination benefits 
as of december    of the severance and termination benefits had been paid and  remained accrued on that date  with the remaining benefits paid in january the restructuring expense totaled  and included a workforce reduction of employees  or of our employee base at the time 
of the  restructuring charge   related to our international data analysis segment and the remaining  was attributable to our domestic data analysis segment 
as part of this restructuring  the company combined its german operations with its swiss subsidiary headquartered in basel  switzerland 
on september   shawn javid  president and ceo  resigned from the company 
the restructuring charges  including charges associated with the resignation of shawn javid  consisted primarily of employee severance and termination payments and lease termination costs  as well as a  non cash compensation charge related to a modification of stock options upon termination of mr 
javid 
as of december   in termination benefits remained to be paid  of which  will be paid in and the remaining  in interest income and expense interest and other income decreased from  in to  in  and increased to  in the decrease in was due to a decrease in prevailing interest rates 
the increase in was primarily attributable to an exchange gain of  related to foreign currency transactions 
interest expense increased from  in to  in  and decreased to  in the higher expense in was due to borrowings of  under an equipment term loan with silicon valley bank 
the decrease in was due to the  principal pay down of the equipment loan 
income taxes as of december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of these net operating losses and other tax credits also reflect the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement amounts 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes equal to the amount of the net deferred tax assets 
income tax expense of  in reflects the provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
the income tax benefit in of  primarily relates to a reversal of income taxes payable and a tax refund on completion of a tax audit at one of our international operations 
income tax expense of  in reflects provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations

we recorded a net gain of  on the sale in after taking into account net assets transferred and certain liabilities arising from the transaction including severance and transaction costs 
the liabilities arising from the sale included accruals related to certain contingencies resulting from the disposition 
in  these contingencies were favorably resolved resulting in a net gain of  also recorded as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
in eepd s operating loss totaled  representing revenues earned of  offset by costs and expenses of  for the day period ending january  during we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of  related to previously unidentified potential third party contractual commitments of eepd 
the amounts were not material to the periods in which they applied  primarily and net operating results net loss from continuing operations in was  compared to a net loss from continuing operations of  in and  in the loss from continuing operations resulted from slower than expected revenue growth in the second half of the year due to a slowing economy  a change in the revenue mix to a higher proportion of services revenues with lower gross profit  and to acquisition related amortization and deferred compensation charges 
we incurred a loss from continuing operations of  in the fourth quarter of this loss was also the result of higher operating expenses in  including a  restructuring charge related to employee severance and termination benefits  the operating costs associated with the three acquisitions completed in the third quarter of  and amortization and deferred compensation charges related to our acquisition of predict ag in switzerland 
the loss from continuing operations resulted from lower total revenues  higher sales and marketing costs resulting from international expansion  higher net research and development expense resulting from an increase in our product line  the  loss from impairment of goodwill related to our swiss subsidiary  and the  restructuring charge 
we incurred a loss from continuing operations of  in the fourth quarter of as compared to a  loss in the prior year comparable quarter 
the fourth quarter loss included a loss from impairment of goodwill charge of  and a  increase in expense  offset in part by a  improvement in gross profit due to a higher mix of software revenues as compared to services 
the loss from continuing operations primarily resulted from the  restructuring charge and  loss from impairment of goodwill 
the fourth quarter of resulted in income from continuing operations of  this income was the result of higher revenues than in previous quarters coupled with expense saving measures taken earlier in the year offset somewhat by the impairment of goodwill charge of  net income in was  compared to a net loss of  in and a net loss of  in the net income reflected our loss from continuing operations offset by the net gain on the sale of eepd and the eepd operating loss

on december   a judge for the superior court for king county  washington granted summary judgment in our favor and dismissed 
mr 
alayian has appealed the decision 

an evaluation of the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be expressed with sufficient certainty at this time 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our operating position  results of operations  and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to  at the end of from  at the end of and  at december  we generated  in cash from operations in compared to  in and  in operating cash inflows in and were primarily the result of losses from continuing operations adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization and goodwill impairment  and benefiting from a decrease in receivables in and an increase in deferred revenue in both years 
investing activities resulted in the net use of  in   in and  in in and investing activities resulted primarily from the purchases of capital equipment

these credit facilities contain covenants that limit our net losses and restrict the amount of capital expenditures not financed through the equipment term loan 
in addition  we are prohibited from paying dividends 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  these credit facilities may be utilized to finance future capital investments  including technology necessary to support our new product lines 
these credit facilities expand our liquid resources and ability to maintain an adequate balance of cash on hand
