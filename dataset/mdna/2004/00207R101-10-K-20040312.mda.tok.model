item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this report 
overview atmi is a leading supplier of materials  materials delivery systems  and high purity materials packaging products used worldwide in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
atmi specifically targets the front end semiconductor materials market 
this market includes the processes used to convert a bare silicon wafer into a fully functional wafer that contains many copies of a semiconductor device or chip 
to complete the manufacturing process  this functional wafer is taken through a back end manufacturing process that includes wafer dicing into chips  packaging and testing 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
during  atmi announced its intention to reduce its exposure to the capital equipment cycles by exiting non core product lines which represented nearly all of our former technologies segment 
the non core product lines that we expect to exit include the following environmental abatement equipment  materials sensing and monitoring equipment  specialty thin film deposition services  outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services  our smartcard device venture  and gallium nitride materials 
the company intends to complete these exit activities by the end of the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the non core product lines as discontinued operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for additional details 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of atmi s financial condition and results of continuing operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires atmi to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities and investments  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  income taxes  restructuring charges  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and services rendered and collectibility of those fees 
the company s revenues from product sales are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon shipment 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all 
table of contents acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period of the related contract  or if not under contract  when service is provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company accrues for sales returns  warranty costs and other allowances based on a current evaluation of its historical experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
past due status of accounts receivable is determined primarily based upon contractual terms 
atmi grants extended payment terms  which vary based on the geographic location of the customer and generally range from to days 
there are no known material collectibility issues with these extended term receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company provides inventory allowances for estimated excess  obsolete and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon future demand forecasts and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
marketable securities and investments the company holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or related to its strategic focus  some of which are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile and some of which are in private companies whose value is difficult to determine 
investments in private companies are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term assets  net 
atmi records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment atmi s net property  plant and equipment at december  was million  representing of the company s consolidated total assets 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total operating expenses  including cost of revenues 
management s judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
property  plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors  including historical experience with similar assets  technological life cycles  and geographic locations 
circumstances and events relating to these assets are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly 

table of contents goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  management reviews goodwill for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that its value may have declined 
in order to evaluate impairment of goodwill  assumptions about the future condition and operations of the business unit to which the goodwill asset relates are made 
these assumptions are applied to complex models in which we estimate the fair value of the business unit utilizing projected future cash flows  multiples of earnings and sales and other factors 
using these models  management determines whether an impairment charge is required to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value 
this estimation process is complex and involves subjective assumptions about future events and discount factors to be applied to projected cash flows 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as business and economic trends  government regulation  and technological changes 
management believes the assumptions made to evaluate goodwill impairment are appropriate and reasonable 
however  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods that may be material 
other identifiable intangible assets other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired patents and trademarks  customer base and covenants not to compete are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation at december   the company has six stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the effect on net loss and loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
restructuring during the fiscal years ended december  and  the company recorded significant charges in connection with restructuring and other initiatives 
these charges include costs related to employee separation costs  plant closing costs  early lease termination expenses and various other asset and working capital write offs or write downs 
although management does not anticipate significant changes to the charge  the actual costs may differ from the estimates used 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
likewise  in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included money market securities  corporate and municipal bond obligations and commercial paper 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction to interest rates would increase the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of fixed rate long term convertible notes outstanding 
interest rate changes and changes in the value of our common stock would likely result in changes in the market value of these notes 
the fair value of these notes was approximately million at december  we perform a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate long term convertible debt to assess the risk of changes in fair value 
the model to determine interest rate sensitivity assumes a hypothetical basis point shift in interest rates  while keeping the price of our common stock constant 
at december   assuming a basis point increase in interest rates  the fair value of the notes would decrease by million 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  would increase the fair value of the notes by million 
the model to determine equity price sensitivity assumes a hypothetical change in the price of our common stock  while keeping the interest rate constant 
at december   assuming a increase in the price of our common stock  the fair value of the notes would increase by million 
conversely  a decrease in the price of our common stock would result in the fair value of the notes decreasing by million 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company currently utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain japanese yen exposures  but does not use any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   atmi had million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated assets 
holding other variables constant  if there were a adverse change in foreign exchange rates for the japanese yen  the fair market value of the contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million 
the effect of an immediate change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
changes in market risk there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposure between the fiscal years ended december  and december
