table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the company continually evaluates the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  the company s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
the company has identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies and legal costs the company records loss contingencies as a liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with loss contingencies are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to loss contingencies and legal costs to be a critical accounting estimate as contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods and estimation of probable losses and costs to litigate requires forecasts that often depend on judgments from third party experts and are based on potential actions by other third parties such as plaintiffs  juries  and regulators

impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the company identifies impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of the company s reporting units is derived from an estimate of future discounted cash flows including an estimate for terminal value 
the company utilizes a percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a trademark is the company s only indefinite lived intangible asset 
the company identifies impairment of this trademark by comparing its fair value to its carrying amount 
the fair value of the trademark is calculated based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows including an estimate for terminal value related to the net amount of royalty expense avoided due to the existence of the trademark 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of future discounted cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates

impairment of long lived assets the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that are compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be a critical accounting estimate because the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary

retirement benefits the company s employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by the company s actuaries in calculating such amounts 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in the company s financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation rates  salary growth rates  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the company has developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
discount rate assumptions are based on investment yields available on long term bonds 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
inflation assumptions are based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience and mortality tables 

table of contents the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions pension postretirement benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect the company s pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations

contingent convertible senior subordinated notes in may of  the company completed the sale of million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of company common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met including that kaydon common stock has traded above for out of trading days for specified periods of time 
unless and until this contingency or other conversion contingencies are met  the above mentioned shares of the company s common stock underlying the notes will not be included in the company s basic or diluted earnings per share calculations 
should this contingency be met  diluted earnings per share would  depending on the relationship between the interest on the notes and the earnings per share of kaydon common stock  be expected to decrease as a result of the inclusion of the underlying shares in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires the company to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed for cash instead of converted into company common stock 
should this happen  depending on other factors  tax payments may increase 
the company believes that the current and potential future impact the notes have on the accounting for the company s diluted earnings per share calculations  and tax related account balances as discussed above are critical to the understanding of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in the company s stock price could cause the underlying shares to be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in one quarter  and not in a subsequent quarter 
redemption of the notes for cash may cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company

deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which the company conducts business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be a critical accounting estimate because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current reserves and tax rates  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
the company evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
the company believes the accounting estimates related to inventories to be a critical accounting estimate because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary

kaydon does not undertake any responsibility to update its forward looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances 
the following risk factors could affect the company s operating results 

table of contents the company s customers economic cycles may affect kaydon s operating results 
many of the company s customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and other factors  including capital spending levels 
such industries include commercial and military aerospace  semiconductor manufacturing  power generation  off road and heavy industrial equipment  and other capital equipment manufacturing 
as a result  the demand for the company s products by these customers depends  in part  upon general economic conditions 
historically  downward economic cycles have reduced customer demand for the company s products  thereby reducing sales of the company s products and resulting in reductions to the company s revenues and net earnings 
increased competition in the company s key markets could result in a reduction in kaydon s revenues and earnings and adversely affect the company s financial condition 
the industries in which the company operates are fragmented and the company faces competition from multiple companies across its diverse product lines 
kaydon expects competitive pressures from new products and aggressive pricing to increase  which may cause the company to lose market share or compel the company to reduce prices to remain competitive  which could result in reduced levels of revenues and earnings 
the company s competitors include us and us companies  some of which benefit from lower labor costs and fewer regulatory burdens 
in addition  certain competitors  including perkin elmer  timken  skf  and ina fag  are larger than kaydon and may have access to greater financial  technical  development  marketing  manufacturing  sales and distribution services and other resources 
increased competition with these companies or new entrants to the company s key markets could prevent price increases for the company s products or could require price reductions for the company s products  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  growth or liquidity 
future acquisitions may require kaydon to incur costs and liabilities which may adversely affect the company s operating results 
in addition to internal growth  kaydon s current strategy involves growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses as well as acquisitions that diversify the company s product offerings 
like other companies with similar growth strategies  kaydon may be unable to continue to implement its growth strategy  and this strategy may be ultimately unsuccessful 
a portion of the company s expected future growth in revenues may result from acquisitions 
the company frequently engages in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions  certain of which  if consummated  could be significant to the company 
although it is the company s policy only to acquire companies in transactions which are accretive to both earnings and cash flow  any potential acquisitions may result in material transaction expenses  increased interest and amortization expense  increased depreciation expense and increased operating expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
acquisitions may entail integration and management of the new businesses to realize economies of scale and control costs 
in addition  acquisitions may involve other risks  including diversion of management resources otherwise available for ongoing development of our business and risks associated with entering new markets 
the company may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future  obtain acceptable financing or consummate any future acquisitions 
in addition  as a result of the company s acquisitions of other businesses  the company may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify the company 
future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of securities 
political  economic and regulatory conditions inherent in the international markets in which kaydon participates could adversely affect the company s financial condition 
sales of the company s products from the company s foreign subsidiaries and from the company s domestic subsidiaries selling to foreign locations accounted for approximately percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended december  these foreign sales could be adversely affected by changes in 
table of contents various foreign countries political and economic conditions  trade protection measures  differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of the company s products or increase the company s costs 
the company generates significant revenues outside the united states 
currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for the company s products in foreign countries where the us dollar has increased in value compared to the local currency 
the company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon the company s future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
kaydon s manufactured critical performance products expose the company to potential litigation related costs which may adversely affect the company s financial position and operating results 
as a provider of critical performance products in a variety of industries including aerospace  defense  construction  marine  medical  material handling  machine tool positioning and other industrial applications  the company faces a risk of exposure to claims in the event that the failure  use or misuse of the company s products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
the company  along with certain other companies  is named as a defendant in a lawsuit arising from an august fatal accident involving a mhe helicopter manufactured by sikorsky aircraft corporation 
the company believes that the alleged damages claimed in this lawsuit  and the associated legal costs  will be fully covered under the company s insurance policy  but it is possible that such costs will not be covered by insurance and  if so  the company will incur unknown additional direct costs 
these claims have not been finally resolved or settled 
in the past  costs related to legal proceedings and settlements have had a material effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the company cannot assure you that the ultimate cost of current known or future unknown litigation and claims will not exceed management s current expectations and it is possible that such costs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  litigation is time consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from the company s business 
the transactions lawsuit could materially adversely affect the company if the trial court s dismissal of the claims in such suit is reversed on appeal and if an adverse ruling is entered on appeal 
the company  along with certain other companies  was a defendant in a lawsuit filed in asserting claims for fraudulent conveyance and successor liability relating to the company s acquisition of certain assets in and the company s spin off from bairnco corporation the transactions lawsuit 
the plaintiffs in the transactions lawsuit alleged and sought damages of million  plus interest and punitive damages against the defendants collectively 
as previously disclosed  the plaintiff s claims were dismissed with prejudice by the trial court on march  on april   the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal 
briefing on the appeal is complete  and the appeal is expected to be heard by the court of appeals during the first quarter of if an unfavorable outcome were to occur  the impact could be material to the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of its ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a 
table of contents basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for the year would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  canada  mexico  and japan 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which many costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
