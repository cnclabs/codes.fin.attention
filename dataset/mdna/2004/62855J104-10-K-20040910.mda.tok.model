item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and marketing of novel therapeutic and molecular diagnostic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new healthcare products that treat major diseases and assess a person s risk of disease later in life 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to undertaking our drug discovery and development programs  operating our predictive medicine business  and continuing our research and development efforts 
we have three reportable operating segments i research  ii predictive medicine  and iii drug development 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding these operating segments 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of predictive medicine products and research payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for year ended june   we had a net loss of million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  the initiation and continuing conduct of human clinical trials  the launch of new predictive medicine products  the continuation of our internal research and development programs  and expansion of our facilities 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our pharmaceutical and predictive medicine businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and investments in privately held companies 
revenue recognition 
research revenues include revenues from research agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of sab to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement and based on costs incurred relative to the total estimated contract costs cost to cost method 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our cost to cost calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved and where the amount of the milestone payments approximates the value of achieving the milestone 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
predictive medicine revenues include revenues from the sale of predictive medicine products and related marketing agreements 
predictive medicine revenue is recognized upon completion of the test and communication of results 
up front payments related to marketing agreements are recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our predictive medicine products 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment term changes when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debt 
investments in privately held companies 
we review the valuation of our investments in privately held biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for possible impairment as changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment should be assessed 
the amount of impairment  if any  and valuation of these investments are based on our estimates and  in certain circumstances  the completion of independent  third party appraisals of the investments 
inherent in these estimates and appraisals are assumptions such as the comparability of the investee to similar publicly traded companies  the value of the investee s underlying research and development efforts  the likelihood that the investee s current research projects will result in a marketable product  and the investee s expected future cash flows 
accordingly  the amount recognized by us upon ultimate liquidation of these investments may vary significantly from the estimated fair values at june  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities finr 
finr clarifies the application of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
finr requires the consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities  by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the entity  if any  that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both 
among other changes  the revisions of finr a clarified some requirements of the original fin  which had been issued in january  b eased some implementation problems  and c added new scope exceptions 
finr deferred the effective date of the interpretation for public companies  to the end of the first reporting period ending after march  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables issue no 

in applying issue no 
 separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
issue no 
also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the adoption of this issue did not have a material effect on our business  results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
results of operations years ended june  and predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
predictive medicine revenue is comprised primarily of sales of predictive medicine products  and also includes some marketing fees and forensic dna analysis fees 
increased sales and marketing efforts  coupled with recent publications concerning the clinical utility of our products have resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenues will continue to increase at historical rates 
total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
related party research revenues included in total research revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and were million and million  respectively 
related party research revenue is comprised of certain research services performed for prolexys pharmaceuticals  inc  which is owned by us 
the agreement to provide these research services was terminated effective january  research revenues are comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements  amortization of upfront technology license fees and milestone payments 
this decrease in total research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of two of our research collaborations with corporate partners 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues may increase or decrease proportionately 
predictive medicine cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in predictive medicine cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our predictive medicine business 
our technology and efficiency improvements also contributed to an increase in our gross profit margin  which was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that predictive medicine gross profit margins will continue to increase at historical rates 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials in alzheimer s disease and prostate cancer  increases in our other drug discovery and drug development programs  the settlement of claims resulting from a dispute with a third party  and increases in internally funded research programs 
these increases added approximately million to our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by the completion of two of our research collaborations  which resulted in decreased research and development expenses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate based on changes in our research programs and the progression of our drug development programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  executive  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  business development  allocated facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
this increase of was primarily attributable to general increases in costs to support growth in our predictive medicine business and therapeutic development efforts 
increases in salaries and benefits  facilities costs  bad debt  legal  and other costs resulted in an increase of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by reduced marketing costs from our direct to consumer advertising campaign conducted in the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of new product launches and our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
years ended june  and predictive medicine revenue for our fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales and marketing efforts and wider acceptance of our products by the medical community resulted in increased revenues for the year ended june  however  there can be no assurance that predictive medicine revenue will continue to increase at historical rates

this increase of in total research revenue is primarily attributable to revenue recognized from our dupont and abbott laboratories collaborations  including a million milestone recognized and received from abbott laboratories for the discovery of a gene involved in depression 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  revenues may increase or decrease proportionately 
predictive medicine cost of revenue for our fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in predictive medicine cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in predictive medicine revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to prior fiscal year 
gross margin percent for the fiscal year ended june  was compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross margin percent resulted from technology improvements and gains in efficiencies in the operations of our predictive medicine business 
research and development expenses for our fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials in prostate cancer and alzheimer s disease  other drug development programs  and increased research efforts associated with our dupont collaboration 
these increases added approximately million to our research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  these increases were partially offset by the completion of several research collaborations and changes to internally funded research programs  which resulted in decreased research and development expenses of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses for our fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year

accounts payable decreased by million between june  and june   primarily as a result of payments made for purchases of equipment and lab supplies 
deferred revenue  representing the difference in collaborative payments received and research revenue recognized  decreased by million between june  and june  due to the completion of two of our research collaborations 
our investing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and used cash of million during the prior fiscal year 
investing activities were comprised primarily of changes to marketable investment securities and capital expenditures for research equipment 
financing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
in june we received million in net proceeds from an underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our outstanding shelf registration statement on form s registration no

during the fiscal year ended june  additional funds were received from the exercise of stock options 
we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors  including the progress of our preclinical and clinical activities  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of our drug discovery and drug development programs  the cost of developing and launching additional predictive medicine products  the costs of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs associated with competing technological and market developments  the costs associated with potential litigation  the payments received under collaborative agreements and changes in collaborative research relationships  the costs associated with potential commercialization of our discoveries  if any  including the development of manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  and the cost and availability of third party financing for capital expenditures and administrative and legal expenses 
because of our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to raise funds when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
contractual obligations the following table represents our consolidated contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total less than one year years years more than years operating leases      contractual services    purchase commitments total      contractual services represent financial commitments for drug development and clinical trial activities that can be terminated at our request 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
actual payment timing and amounts may differ depending on the timing of goods or services received or other changes 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
