item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company principally focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of antibody  protein and peptide based therapeutic products 
we currently have two product candidates in or entering into phase ii clinical trials for three indications 
dx is being studied for the treatment of both hereditary angioedema hae and for the prevention of blood loss and other systemic inflammatory responses in on pump open heart surgery and other surgical indications  and dx is being studied for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
in collaboration with genzyme  we are currently conducting two phase ii trials of dx for the treatment of patients with hae one a dose escalating placebo controlled study and the other an open label repeat dose study 
both are multi center trials with investigational sites in the us and worldwide 
independent of our collaboration with genzyme  we have completed a phase i ii study of dx in the united states in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery cabg and plan to initiate a second phase ii trial in this indication in italy in the first half of our collaborator for dx  debiopharm  has completed two phase iia trials  one in adults and one in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients  and is planning to initiate a phase iib trial in this indication in the second half of on october   we completed the sale of our wholly owned separations product subsidiary biotage  llc  formerly operated as biotage  inc  to pyrosequencing ab  see sale of separations business below 
we use our proprietary  patented technology  known as phage display  to identify a range of compounds consisting of monoclonal antibodies  small proteins and peptides  with the potential for the treatment of various diseases 
we are using phage display technology to build a broad portfolio of product candidates that we plan to develop and commercialize either ourselves or with others 
on behalf of collaborators  we also use phage display technology to identify compounds that can be used in therapeutics  diagnostic imaging agents and to purify biopharmaceuticals 
we are further leveraging our phage display technology through collaborations and licenses that are structured to generate revenues through research funding  license fees  technical and clinical milestone payments  and royalties 
we continued to incur losses in and expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years as we continue our current and anticipated development projects  particularly our clinical trial programs for dx and dx  and as we develop our discovery  research  marketing  sales and manufacturing capabilities 
clinical development programs dx for hae 
in collaboration with genzyme  we are currently developing dx as a treatment for hae in two phase ii clinical trials  one a dose escalating placebo controlled study known as edema and the other an open label repeat dose study known as edema both are multi center trials with investigational sites in the us and worldwide 
in march  we successfully completed patient treatment in a nine patient phase ii  dose ranging clinical trial in europe 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  dx for hae costs included within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss  less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture kallikrein llc per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss  net research and development expenses for dx for hae  equity loss in joint venture kallikrein llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net loss on dx for hae program    during  research and development expenses on this program totaled million compared with million in and in research and development expenses increased from to principally due to the initiation both of the edema trials in and the cost of drug manufacture to support these trials 
research and development expenses increased from to principally due to an increase in drug manufacture to support the european phase ii trial  despite a decrease in costs associated with preclinical studies 
in june  genzyme exercised its option under our collaboration agreement to create kallikrein llc 
through the creation of kallikrein llc  genzyme acquired a financial interest in the dx program 
kallikrein llc is responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program incurred after the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae 
during  kallikrein llc reimbursed us for million of our expenses 
this reimbursement is recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture kallikrein llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss because it includes funding we provided to kallikrein llc 
the resulting net million of research and development expenses for dx for hae represent costs incurred prior to the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae and therefore were not reimbursed 
all future costs will be reimbursed by kallikrein llc 
from its formation to december   kallikrein llc had a net loss of million 
this loss represents the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae 
our portion of the loss  accounted for under the equity method  of million is proportional to our financial interest in the program and is separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
we currently anticipate filing the biologic license application bla for dx for the treatment of hae in based upon this timeline  we estimate the total remaining costs to commercialization to be in the range of million to million 
we will be responsible for funding one half of these costs  or million to million 
these costs exclude costs associated with the development of an alternative method for delivering the drug subcutaneously 
dx for cabg 
independent of our collaboration with genzyme  we are developing dx as a treatment for patients undergoing on pump open heart surgery  specifically coronary artery bypass graft surgery cabg 
during the first quarter of  we exercised an option to purchase full rights to dx for this and other surgical indications from genzyme 
the cost for exercising the option was million and was expensed in the first quarter of during  research and development expenses on this program totaled million  including the million paid to genzyme when we exercised an option to purchase full rights to dx for surgical indications 
in  we completed a phase i ii clinical trial of dx for patients undergoing cabg and we plan to initiate a second phase ii clinical trial in the first half of in italy 
we expect this trial to cost approximately to million 
due to the fact that bayer ag currently markets aprotinin under the name trasylol for reduction of blood loss in cabg patients  further development work on this indication may require phase iii clinical trials anticipated to be approximately  patient comparing dx to trasylol 
any such trial would entail significant additional costs 
before we proceed with such trials  we plan to partner with another company or obtain additional financing that will allow us to develop the product independently 
dx for cystic fibrosis 
in collaboration with debiopharm sa  dx is being developed as a treatment for cystic fibrosis 
debiopharm has completed two phase iia clinical trials with dx in europe  one in adult and one in pediatric cystic fibrosis patients  and is planning to initiate a phase iib trial for cystic fibrosis in the second half of in addition  we are currently considering alternatives to accelerate the clinical development of dx  including conducting independent clinical trials in the united states and elsewhere 
during  we incurred research  development and manufacturing expenses on this program of million compared with million in and  in research and development expenses on this program decreased from to principally due to a decrease in manufacturing costs due to the timing of cost recognition 
the increase from to was principally due to additional manufacturing and process development costs  and an increase in internal program support costs due to having a complete year of activity under this program 
these costs were fully funded by debiopharm 
under our existing collaboration agreement  debiopharm is responsible for the management of all non clinical and clinical trials and all costs associated with such clinical trials  and any costs incurred by dyax in connection with the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for dx are fully funded by debiopharm 
this financial structure could be altered if we were to amend our collaboration agreement with debiopharm and assume responsibility for the clinical development of dx goals for clinical development programs 
our goal for each of our three ongoing clinical development programs is to obtain marketing approval from the fda and analogous international regulatory agencies 
because of uncertainties associated with our ongoing clinical trials  our ability to locate a development partner or obtain the additional funding needed to complete clinical trials in the cabg and cystic fibrosis programs  the preparation and filing of the bla  and the regulatory review process  and the risks associated with the clinical approval process  including the risk that we may have to repeat  revise or expand the scope of trials or conduct additional clinical trials not presently planned to secure marketing approvals  we are unable to accurately predict the costs to complete any of these programs  the completion dates  or whether these projects will be successfully completed at all 
material cash inflows for any of these programs will not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if the product candidate finds acceptance in the marketplace as a treatment for its disease indication 
because of the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these programs will commence  if ever 
discovery programs through internal discovery activities  and through business relationships with academic institutions and private genomics companies  we use our proprietary phage display technology to identify compounds with therapeutic potential 
furthermore  once we have identified a compound  we utilize various in vitro and in vivo animal models to determine the most promising therapeutic leads to move forward in development 
at present  we have a total of eleven discovery programs underway in the oncology area  three of which we are developing in collaboration with other companies  focused on targets that are believed to be important mediators of inflammation  and collaborative discovery program for antibodies that have potential to efficiently control the progression of aids in hiv infected patients 
currently all compounds identified under these programs are in various stages of discovery  although it is anticipated that one or more such compounds will enter into formal pre clinical development in the goal of these programs is to discover  develop  manufacture and obtain marketing approval for product candidates 
material cash inflows may not commence until after marketing approvals are obtained  and then only if an approved product finds acceptance in the marketplace 
in order to obtain marketing approval for any compounds identified under these programs  we will need to initiate and complete pre clinical development and phase i  phase ii and or phase iii clinical trials with satisfactory results and submit a bla to the fda 
because of this  and the many risks and uncertainties relating to the completion of clinical trials  receipt of marketing approvals and acceptance in the marketplace  we cannot predict when material cash inflows from these projects will commence  if ever 
licensing and funded research activities we have granted over companies and institutions licenses to use our proprietary phage display technology and phage display libraries 
these licenses allow others to exploit our technology in therapeutic discovery and in non core areas such as diagnostic imaging  research reagents and separations 
in addition  we perform funded research for collaborators within the biopharmaceutical industry 
we believe that these programs provide support for our patent position in phage display and for the usefulness of phage display as an enabling discovery technology 
additionally  these programs generate short term and long term value for us through licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
sale of separations business on october   we completed the sale of our wholly owned separations product subsidiary biotage  llc  formerly operated as biotage  inc  biotage to pyrosequencing ab for a gross purchase price of million 
the sale of biotage has allowed us to focus exclusively on biotherapeutics  and the cash generated by the sale of biotage will help us advance our clinical programs as well as the pre clinical candidates in our pipeline 
the purchase price was million before transaction expenses and deduction for approximately million of biotage debt 
we received approximately million in cash at closing and paid approximately million in transaction expenses 
an additional million is being held in an indemnity escrow to cover the representations  warranties and covenants of dyax contained in the agreement  which will be payable to us within one year to the extent that there are no claims against the escrow 
as of march   there have been no claims made against the escrow 
for the year ended december   we have recognized a million gain on this sale 
as of december   the assets  liabilities and operations of biotage that were sold to pyrosequencing are presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the treatment of biotage as a discontinued operation 
recent developments in january  we sold  shares of our common stock including  shares pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their over allotment option at a price of per share in a registered underwritten public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
results of operations revenues 
substantially all our revenues have come from licensing  funded research and development activities  including  milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators 
these revenues fluctuate from year to year 
total revenues for were million  compared with million in and million in the decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from a funded research agreement with human genome sciences  inc  which was completed in june this decrease was partially offset by a  increase in other licensing and funded research agreements 
the increase from to was primarily due to a million increase in revenues under our collaboration agreement for the development of dx with debiopharm due to the increased funding for internal and external manufacturing costs 
research and development 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  are summarized as follows year ended december  net  research and development expenses per consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss   equity loss in joint venture kallikrein llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss pro forma research and development expenses   our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs  including personnel dedicated to research and development activities and from the fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside professionals to conduct research  clinical studies and trials  and to manufacture drug compounds and related supplies prior to fda approval 
our pro forma research and development expenses for were million  compared with pro forma research and development expenses of million in and million in the decrease from to was primarily due to the reimbursement by kallikrein llc of million of our costs associated with the development of dx for the treatment of hae  which was partially offset by the million loss representing our pro rata portion of kallikrein llc s net loss 
all development expenses incurred by the related parties on behalf of kallikrein llc are billed to and reimbursed by kallikrein llc 
because the reimbursement we received includes funding that we provided to the llc  we recorded the reimbursement as a reduction of research and development expenses so that we present net research and development expenses 
the research and development expenses also reflect an  reduction in lab supplies  and the cost of exercising a million option to purchase the rights to dx for on pump open heart surgery and other surgical indications from genzyme 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased compound manufacturing and related external research and development expenditures for clinical trials  partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs associated with our september staff reduction 
our management believes that the above presentation of pro forma research and development expenses provides investors a better understanding of how total research and development efforts affect our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
our presentation of this measure  however  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees  market research and promotion activities and the reporting requirements of a public company 
total general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million for the decrease of million from to was primarily due to a million decrease in employment costs  partially attributable to the effects of our september staff reduction in our cambridge facility and a  decrease in legal costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in the cost of directors and officers insurance 
the increase from to was primarily due a  increase in professional fees related to expanding and protecting our intellectual property  a  increase in salaries and fringe expenses in business development and corporate administrative functions 
discontinued operations 
our activities from discontinued operations are the operations of biotage  which were sold to pyrosequencing on october  including the gain on the sale of biotage 
the gain was comprised of a million gain on sale and a loss of million on biotage s operations for the year to date period ended october   compared to a loss on operations of  for and million for the million increase in loss on operations from to the period were primarily due to a decrease in revenues in non core product lines  specifically biotage s kiloprep and flex systems 
the million decrease in loss on operations from to were primarily due to increased unit sales in biotage s drug discovery purification systems and consumable business 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and to pay debt service 
through december   we have funded our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  including net proceeds of million from our august initial public offering and net proceeds of million from our march registered directed offering 
we have also generated funds from biopharmaceutical product development and license fee revenues  separations product revenues of our former biotage division  interest income  long term obligations and other sources 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  an increase of million from december  this amount does not include the million in net proceeds that we received in early january from our sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a registered underwritten public offering 
our excess funds are currently invested in us treasury obligations and certificates of deposit 
our operating activities used cash of million in  compared with million in and million in our cash used in operating activities for consisted primarily of our net loss from continuing operations of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of billings to debiopharm under our collaboration agreement  and an increase in prepaid expense and other assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million due primarily to the timing of payments made to our contract manufacturer 
the activities for included a decrease in deferred revenue of million due primarily to the timing of revenue recognition on our collaboration with debiopharm  and an increase in prepaid expense and other assets of million  partially offset by depreciation and amortization costs totaling million 
the activities for included a million increase in accounts receivable due primarily to billing under our research agreement with bracco 
our investing activities provided cash of million in  and used cash totaling million and million for and  respectively 
our investing activities for the included the million received on the sale of biotage llc  repayments on employee notes receivable of million  including approximately million received from our chief executive officer as full payment on the related note partially offset by million paid to kallikrein llc and payment of million for licensed technology purchased in fixed asset purchases in decreased to  due to the fact that the substantial purchases for our cambridge  massachusetts facility were completed in the investing activities for included the purchases of fixed asset assets relating to our move to a new corporate and research facility in cambridge totaling million  million spent on a purchase of licensed technology and a million increase in restricted cash to secure long term obligations 
the investing activities for included an increase of restricted cash of million to secure the lease on our facility in cambridge  massachusetts and million used to purchase of fixed assets and leasehold improvements to outfit this facility 
the following table summarizes our cash contribution to and investment in our joint venture  kallikrein llc 
year ended december  investment in joint venture kallikrein llc per the consolidated statement of cash flows  equity loss in joint venture kallikrein llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss investment in joint venture kallikrein llc per the consolidated balance sheets  our financing activities provided cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our financing activities for included net proceeds of million from the registered directed offering  completed in march these proceeds were partly offset by repayments of long term obligations of million 
our financing activities for included a million loan from genzyme under the terms of our collaboration agreement  as well as proceeds of million from our cambridge landlord for leasehold improvements 
these proceeds were partially offset by million in repayments of long term obligations 
our financing activities for consisted primarily of million in proceeds from long term obligations   from the issuance of common stock to employees and  in proceeds from a receivable associated with common stock purchases  partially offset by  in repayments of long term obligations 
we have financed fixed asset purchases through capital leases and debt 
capital lease obligations are collateralized by the assets under lease 
certain debt obligations  as amended  are collateralized by a stand by letter of credit for the amount financed  of which none is outstanding at december  as of december   these debt obligations totaled million and will be fully paid by december  in conjunction with our collaboration agreement for the development of dx with genzyme corporation  genzyme agreed to loan us up to million pursuant to a senior secured promissory note and security agreement  and we agreed to grant genzyme a continuing security interest in certain tangible and intangible personal property arising out of the dx program 
in addition  under the terms of the security agreement  once we exercised our option to purchase genzyme s interest in the application of dx in on pump open heart surgery and other surgical indications  we were required to pledge to genzyme a percentage interest in our wholly owned subsidiary  biotage 
on october   as part of the sale of biotage  the security agreement was amended to release the interest in biotage pledged to genzyme in exchange for a continuing security interest in our rights to revenues from our ladner phage display patent portfolio license agreements 
the security agreement  as amended  contains certain financial covenants under which we must maintain at least million in cash or cash equivalents based on our quarterly consolidated financial statements and we must maintain at least one continued listing standard for the nasdaq national market 
as of december   we had borrowed the full million available under the note  the terms of which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
statements about our expectations of the period of time through which financial resources will be adequate to support our operations are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents plus anticipated cash flow from product development  license fees and collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plans into we expect to use approximately million in cash during  net of the anticipated release of the million escrow from the sale of biotage 
if our existing resources and cash flows from product development and license fees are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if market conditions are favorable  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain any required additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years obligation to related party   capital leases    leasehold improvement arrangements  promissory notes   operating lease obligations     patent and product license obligations  total contractual obligations     these amounts exclude any royalties and milestones that we may owe in connection with the development or commercialization of any of our product candidates 
since the prospect of development and commercialization of any particular product candidate is uncertain  we believe the timing and amounts of any potential royalties and other milestones are not currently calculable in any manner that would fairly present purchase obligations 
in addition  we have received a grant from the walloon region of belgium 
this grant includes specific criteria regarding employment and investment levels that need to be met through if we do not meet the criteria  we will be required to refund all or a portion of amounts received under this grant 
as of december   we have received  under this grant 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  receivable collectibility  useful lives with respect to long lived and intangible assets and valuation of common stock  related stock options  and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that our judgment and assumptions with respect to the following significant accounting policies are most critical to the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into biopharmaceutical product development agreements with collaborators for the research and development of therapeutic  diagnostic and other products 
the terms of the agreements may include non refundable signing fees  funding for research and development  licensing fees  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales derived from the collaborations 
non refundable signing fees are recognized as services are performed over the expected term of the collaboration 
funding for research and development  where the amounts recorded are non refundable  is recognized as the related expenses are incurred 
we evaluate all collaborative agreements on a quarterly basis to determine the appropriate revenue recognition for that period 
the evaluation includes all of the potential revenue components from each specific collaborative agreement 
upon achievement of milestones  a portion of the milestone payment equal to the percentage of the collaboration completed through that date is recognized 
the remainder is recognized as services are performed over the remaining term of the collaboration 
royalties are recognized when earned 
we license our patent rights covering phage display on a non exclusive basis in the fields of therapeutics  antibody based in vitro diagnostics  research products and others 
standard terms of the license agreements  for which we have no future obligations  generally include non refundable signing fees  non refundable annual license maintenance fees  development milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
signing fees and annual maintenance fees are recognized in equal monthly installments over the period to which the payment applies 
perpetual patent licenses are recognized immediately if we have no future obligations 
milestone payments under non exclusive phage display patent licenses are recognized when the milestone is achieved if the company has no future obligations under the license and royalties are recognized when they are earned 
payments received that have not met the appropriate criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
at december  and  our deferred revenue related to product development agreements was million and million  respectively 
significant assumptions and estimates include the expected term of the agreement and total expected cost 
our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in our estimates could have a material impact on revenues and our results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze our accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable balance net of allowances for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and the provision for doubtful accounts was  valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets  including capitalized license rights  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant industry or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
our intangible assets at the end of consisted of a license for antibody technology from a third party 
the balance of our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was million and million at december  and  respectively 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions our chief executive officer also serves as an outside director of genzyme corporation and was a consultant to genzyme until one of our directors is a director of genzyme and another is a senior advisor to the chief executive officer of genzyme and a former officer 
we have a collaboration agreement with genzyme for the development and commercialization of dx for the treatment of hereditary angioedema hae 
under this agreement  which was amended on may   and again effective as of september   we were responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with the development of dx for the treatment of hae through the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae  which occurred during the second quarter of in june  genzyme exercised its option to create kallikrein llc  a jointly owned limited liability company  to manage the development and commercialization of dx through the creation of kallikrein llc  genzyme acquired a financial interest in the dx program and is now responsible for of all costs incurred in connection with the development of dx subsequent to completion of the first phase ii clinical trial 
upon dosing the first patient in a pivotal clinical trial of dx for hae  genzyme will also be obligated to pay us a milestone payment of approximately million 
in addition  we will be entitled to receive potential milestone payments of million for the first fda approved product derived from dx  and up to million for additional therapeutic indications developed under the collaboration  as well as approximately of the profits from sales of such products 
under this collaboration agreement  we had the option to purchase genzyme s interest in the application of dx for the prevention of blood loss and other systemic inflammatory responses in on pump open heart surgery and other surgical indications for million 
we exercised this option in the first quarter of in conjunction with the first amendment of the collaboration agreement in may  we also executed a senior secured promissory note and security agreement under which genzyme agreed to loan us up to million and we agreed to grant genzyme a continuing security interest in tangible and intangible personal property arising out of the dx program 
the principal and all unpaid interest will be due on the maturity date of may  we may extend the maturity date to may  if the amended collaboration agreement is in effect  no default or event of default exists and we satisfy the financial covenants as of the initial maturity date 
in addition  under the terms of the security agreement  once we exercised our option to purchase genzyme s interest in the application of dx in on pump open heart surgery and other surgical indications  we were required to pledge to genzyme a percentage interest in our wholly owned subsidiary  biotage 
under an amendment to the security agreement executed on october   genzyme agreed to release the interest in biotage pledged to it in exchange for a continuing security interest in dyax s rights to revenues from licenses of its fundamental phage display patent portfolio 
the security agreement  as amended  contains certain financial covenants under which we must maintain i at least million in cash or cash equivalents based on the our quarterly consolidated financial statements and ii at least one continued listing standard for the nasdaq national market 
as of december   we had borrowed the full million available under the note 
in addition  as of december   genzyme owned approximately of our common stock outstanding 
in  we entered into a sublease agreement with genzyme for laboratory and office facilities in cambridge  massachusetts  which was extended to and terminated in april rent expense in connection with this sublease of  and  was recorded in each year ended december   and  respectively 
during  we signed two patent license agreements with genzyme under our standard license terms 
we recorded license revenues of  for each year ended december   and  in connection with the maintenance fees on these two agreements 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding accounts receivable due from genzyme related to the patent license agreements 
in october  we provided a mortgage loan and pledge agreement in the amount of million to our chief executive officer to purchase a residence within commuting distance of our headquarters 
the remaining million balance on the note was paid off in full in june tax loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which may be available to offset future federal income tax liabilities and expire at various dates from through we have recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of deductions from the exercise of stock options 
this deferred asset has been fully reserved until it is more likely than not that the benefit from the exercise of stock options will be realized 
the benefit from this million deferred tax asset will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital when realized 
as required by sfas no 
 our management has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets  which are comprised principally of nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards 
management has determined at this time that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the benefits of federal and state deferred tax assets and  as a result  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been established at december  recent pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance in the consensus is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which is effective for the company on july  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to december  for interests held by public companies in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements

in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
for mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests  the fasb has deferred certain provisions of sfas the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements

these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit important factors that may affect future operations and results to this form k  which is incorporated into this item by this reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our investments in high quality financial instruments  primarily us treasury funds and certificates of deposit  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million without including the million net proceeds from our january common stock financing consisting of cash and highly liquid  short term investments 
our short term investments will decline by an immaterial amount if market interest rates increase  and therefore  our exposure to interest rate changes is immaterial 
declines of interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income from our short term investments 
as of december   we had million outstanding under long term obligations 
interest rates on million of these obligations are fixed and therefore are not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rate on the remaining million under the genzyme promissory note is variable based on the prime interest rate and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
a increase in the prime rate would result in an additional  in annual interest expense 
most of our transactions are conducted in us dollars 
we have collaboration and technology license agreements with parties located outside of the united states 
we also have a research facility located in europe 
transactions under certain of the agreements between us and parties located outside of the united states  as well as transactions conducted by our foreign facility are conducted in local foreign currencies 
if exchange rates undergo a change of up to  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
