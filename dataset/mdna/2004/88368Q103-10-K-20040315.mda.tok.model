overview history the street 
com  inc  together with its wholly owned subsidiaries collectively  the company  operates its businesses in two segments  electronic publishing and securities research and brokerage 
the company s electronic publishing segment provides investment commentary  analysis and news to both retail and professional customers  which it distributes through its production of web sites  email reports and newsletters  syndicated radio programming  and conferences 
the electronic publishing segment receives revenue from subscription sales  advertising and sponsorship sales  as well as content syndication and conference attendees 
the company s securities research and brokerage segment provides proprietary equity research and brokerage services to institutional clients  and  as a broker dealer  receives revenue from trading commissions  a standard payment method in the professional markets 
in october  the company began the development of a separate  wholly owned subsidiary  independent research group llc irg  to bring high quality  independent equity research to institutional clients 
in april  irg was admitted to the national association of securities dealers  inc nasd as a broker dealer 
irg established correspondent clearing relationships with two brokerage firms and began receiving commission revenue in may additionally  in january  irg announced the commencement of in house equity trading operations on behalf of its clients 
current state of the company the company s total revenue for was million  an increase of over total revenue in of million 
net revenue for the fourth quarter was million  an increase of over fourth quarter net revenue of million 
for the first time in its history  the company earned a profit  reporting net income of  for the fourth quarter  as compared to a net loss of million for the fourth quarter approximately million  or  of the company s total revenue  was received by its electronic publishing segment  which is operated through the street 
com 
although  the company s electronic publishing segment introduced fewer new products in as compared to  its subscription revenue increased approximately year over year  from million in to million in on the expense side  although the company s electronic publishing segment has experienced increases in expenses for content providers and sales salaries and commissions  it has reduced general and administrative expenses and experienced decreases in both depreciation and amortization and non cash compensation expenses 
these reductions  together with the allocation of certain administrative  financial  legal and technology expenses to irg decreased the expenses of the electronic publishing segment to approximately million for during the first three quarters of  the revenue growth in the company s electronic publishing segment was due in large part to the company s focus on marketing its products to its current base of subscribers and registered members 
as the company s most recent online marketing initiative began to generate results in the fourth quarter  the company s marketing focus expanded beyond its current subscriber base  leading to a slight increase in marketing expenditures 
in  the company expects to devote greater resources to the expansion of this initiative  in order to position its electronic publishing segment to take advantage of several trends the company believes are developing in the marketplace for online financial content increased demand for financial and investing content that is free from the conflicts that have plagued traditional wall street research  increased demand for financial and investing products that provide consumers with specific recommendations and increased willingness of consumers to pay for value added content online 
the company s securities research and brokerage segment began receiving revenue in may and totaled approximately million in revenue through december  prior to january   the company operated its business in only one segment 
operated through the company s irg subsidiary  which was essentially a start up business in  the segment incurred million in expenses in however  since irg has expanded both its research and sales staffs  and commenced in house execution of client trades in january  its revenues and expenses have experienced significant growth 
the company believes that the industry trend among large brokerage firms to reduce the size and expense of their research departments has led to the greater availability of talented research analysts for compensation substantially lower than traditional levels  and to overall reductions in coverage by such firms 
additionally  the company believes that pressure by investors on buy side institutions to justify expenses has made them more likely to select small  independent firms offering unbiased  high quality research than in the past  and less likely to select large  so called bulge bracket firms  where commissions bundle together execution costs with the costs of producing high volumes of research and other services 
the company expects to continue to devote significant resources to this segment  further increasing irg s research analyst and sales departments in order to take advantage of these trends 
discontinued operations in november  the company s board of directors decided to discontinue the company s uk operations 
on april   the final meeting of the members was held to bring the liquidation to a close 
a final return in the liquidation was filed on july  in order to formally dissolve the uk operations  and the dissolution became effective on october  critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of fixed assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although results of prior estimates have generally been in line with management s expectations  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenue primarily from subscriptions  advertising  and commissions 
subscription revenue represents customer subscriptions that provide subscribers access to investment commentary  advice  research  analysis and news 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are charged directly to companies that subscribe to the service 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
the company calculates net subscription revenue by deducting refunds and cancellation chargebacks from gross revenue 
net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
deferred revenue liabilities relate to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized 
advertising revenue  derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements  and from the delivery of banner and email advertisements on the company s web sites  as well as from conference sponsorships  is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
although infrequent  company obligations could include guarantees of a minimum number of times that users of the company s web sites click through to the advertisers web site  or take additional specified action  such as opening an account 
in such cases  revenue is recognized as the guaranteed click throughs or other relevant delivery criteria are fulfilled 
commission revenue arises from trades placed through the company s broker dealer subsidiary by its institutional clients 
commission revenue and related expenses are recognized on a trade date basis 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to james j 
cramer s daily radio program  realmoney with jim cramer  syndication revenue  conference attendee revenue  reprint revenue  royalties earned from the company s investing book and barter advertising arrangements only for fiscal years in which such arrangements occurred 
revenue from barter transactions were recognized in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force no 
eitf during the period in which the advertisements were displayed on the company s web sites

there was no barter revenue recognized during the years ended december  and barter revenue recognized during the year ended december  totaled  fair value was determined by the comparable advertising market rates at the time of placement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its advertisers and subscribers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
although results of prior estimates have generally been in line with management s expectations  should the financial condition of the company s advertisers and subscribers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer equipment  including capitalized software and web site development costs  and five years for furniture and fixtures

goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
upon the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of  the company stopped the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite life  and completed the required transitional fair value impairment test on its goodwill and certain other intangible assets  the results of which had no impact on the company s financial statements 
based upon annual impairment tests as of september  and  no impairment was indicated for the company s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
business concentrations and credit risk financial instruments that subject the company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  short term investments  and accounts receivable

the company s customers are primarily concentrated in the united states

capital expenditures generally consisted of purchases of computer software and hardware  as well as purchases of telephone equipment  office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements related to the office space now occupied by irg 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended december  consisted primarily of the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a decrease in restricted cash  partially offset by a decrease in note payable 
the company has a total of  of cash invested in certificates of deposit and money market investments that serves as collateral for outstanding letters of credit  and is therefore restricted 
the letters of credit serve as security deposits for operating leases 
of this total  the company anticipates that  will become unrestricted within the next months  and is therefore classified as a current asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company anticipates that the remaining  of restricted cash will become unrestricted at various times through the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
the company is committed to expenditures in an aggregate amount of approximately million through december   in respect of the contractual obligations set forth in the table below under commitments and contingencies 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to the company  or at all 
strategic relationships  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require the company to provide rights to certain of its content 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the company s then current stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the company s common stock 
treasury stock as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in december the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million worth of the company s common stock 
to date  the company has purchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of  in february  the company s board of directors approved the resumption of its stock repurchase program under new price and volume parameters 
commitments and contingencies the company is committed under operating leases  principally for office space  furniture and fixtures  and equipment 
certain leases are subject to rent reviews and require payment of expenses under escalation clauses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its market risk exposures are immaterial as the company does not have instruments for trading purposes  and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings  material changes in fair values or cash flows for all instruments 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following material risks facing the company 
if any of the following risks occur  the company s business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company may also face other risks that are not discussed in the following description of its risk factors either because it is unaware of such risks or because it presently believes that such risks are immaterial 
the company cannot assure you that any of these other risks  if they were to occur  would not materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company has a history of losses and may incur further losses although the company earned net income of  or per share  for the fourth quarter of  the company had previously incurred operating losses in each fiscal quarter since its formation  and may again experience operating losses in the future 
as of december   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
the company will need to generate significant revenue in order to cover the significant operating expenses it expects to incur during accordingly  the company can make no assurances that it will be able to achieve profitability  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s quarterly financial results may fluctuate and its future revenue is difficult to forecast the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including the level of interest and investment in the stock market by both individual and institutional investors  demand for advertising on the company s web sites  which is affected by seasonal weakness in the first and third quarters  advertising budget cycles of our customers  and the demand for advertising on the internet generally  subscription price reductions attributable to decreased demand or increased competition  new products or services introduced by the company s competitors  content distribution fees or other costs incurred by the company  costs associated with system downtime affecting the internet generally or the company s web sites in particular  and general economic and market conditions 
although we generated net income in the fourth quarter of  you should not rely on the results for that period as an indication of future performance 
in particular  given the above factors  we may not generate net income for fiscal or any quarter therein 
the company forecasts its current and future expense levels based on expected revenue and the company s operating plans 
because of the above factors  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters 
in such an event  the price of the company s common stock is likely to decline 
the company may have difficulty increasing its subscription revenue  a significant portion of which is generated by james j 
cramer and other key writers the company continues to seek to increase its subscription revenue  which represents the single most significant portion of the company s total revenues  approximately for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the company believes it has significantly enhanced its subscription offerings to differentiate them from other financial and investing products available in the marketplace  having introduced  in recent years  publications containing a broad variety of features from a multitude of contributors  as well as more narrowly targeted  trading oriented newsletters  some of which are the work of an individual writer 
while the company believes that the success of its publications is dependent in part upon its brands  some of these publications  particularly the newsletters  nonetheless reflect the talents  efforts  personalities and reputations of their respective writers 
as a result  the services of these key writers  particularly company co founder james j 
cramer  form an essential element of our subscription revenues 
accordingly  the company seeks to compensate and provide incentives for these key writers through competitive salaries  stock ownership and bonus plans  and has entered into employment agreements with several of them 
however  the company can make no assurances that these programs will enable it to retain key writers or  should the company lose the services of one or more of its key writers to death  disability  loss of reputation or other reason  to attract new writers acceptable to readers of the company s publications 
the loss of services of one or more of the company s key writers could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the loss of the services of other key employees could affect the company s business the company s continued success also depends upon the retention of other key employees  including executives to operate its business  technology personnel to run its publishing  commerce  communications and other systems  and salespersons to sell its subscription products and its advertising space 
in addition  the success of the company s proprietary equity research business  operated through its irg subsidiary  depends on its executives  as well as research analysts and traders 
several of the company s key employees are bound by employment or non competition agreements 
in addition  the company seeks to compensate its key executives  as well as other employees  through competitive salaries  stock ownership and bonus plans  but the company can make no assurances that these programs will allow it to retain key employees or hire new employees 
the loss of one or more of the company s key employees  or the company s inability to attract experienced and qualified replacements  could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its proprietary equity research business  which is in the early stages of development in october  the company formed irg as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate its proprietary equity research business 
irg began coverage of equities in the second quarter of  when it became a registered broker dealer 
since its formation  irg has incurred start up costs and expenses  but as of december  has not generated significant revenue 
as it develops and operates this new business  the company will continue to encounter risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties relating to staffing  regulatory compliance  brand development  market acceptance of its products  trading errors  and the strength of the market for equity securities and equity research overall  among others 
the limited operating history of irg makes it difficult to evaluate the business and its prospects or to accurately predict future revenue or results of operations for the business 
accordingly  the prospects for this business should be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development 
the company can make no assurances that it will successfully develop and operate its proprietary equity research business or achieve profitability for this business 
irg s revenue may not be sufficient to cover its expenses irg s current business plan involves the production of proprietary equity research  the marketing of investment analysis and research products produced by thestreet 
com  and the dissemination of the foregoing to institutional money managers and hedge funds at no charge to these customers 
in return  irg expects that these institutional money managers and hedge funds will voluntarily pay for this research using so called soft dollars  by electing to execute transactions through irg 
see business marketing marketing of professional products soft dollar brokers and business marketing marketing of institutional research and brokerage services 
however  irg does not expect to conduct other revenue generating activities at this time  and there is no guarantee that these activities will generate sufficient revenue to cover irg s expenses 
furthermore  in response to the recent mutual fund scandal  several members of congress have introduced mutual fund reform legislation that could  if passed  affect the use of soft dollars to pay for research services 
see risk factors government regulation and legal uncertainties securities industry regulation 
the company may have difficulty increasing its advertising revenue  a significant portion of which is concentrated among the company s top advertisers the company s ability to increase its advertising revenue depends on a variety of factors  including general market conditions  seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage  the company s ability to increase its unique visitors and page view inventory  and the company s ability to win its share of advertisers total advertising budgets from other web sites  television  radio and print media 
if the company s advertising revenue decreases because of these factors  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s top five advertisers accounted for approximately of its total advertising revenue  excluding conference sponsorship revenue  as compared to approximately for the three months ended september  and approximately for the three months ended december  furthermore  although the company continues to work to attract advertisers from outside the financial services industry  such as automotive and luxury goods  a large proportion of the company s top advertisers are concentrated in financial services  particularly in the online brokerage business 
if these industries were to weaken significantly  or if other factors caused the company to lose a number of its top advertisers  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as is typical in the advertising industry  the company s advertising contracts have short notice cancellation provisions 
intense competition could reduce the company s market share and harm its financial performance the company s ability to compete successfully depends on many factors  including the quality and timeliness of its content and that of the company s competitors  the success of the company s recommendations and research  the ease of use of services developed either by the company or its competitors and the effectiveness of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
we face competition for customers  advertisers  employees and contributors from a wide variety of financial news and information sources  as well as other types of companies  including online business  finance or investing web sites  publishers and distributors of traditional media focused on finance and investing  including print publications and radio and television programs  and investment newsletter publishers 
as our business has expanded into new areas  such as equity research and brokerage services  and advisory reports  the company also faces significant competition from a new set of competitors  including established wall street investment banking firms  large financial institutions  equity research boutiques  and other securities professionals that offer similar information and that have firmly established customer relationships 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company does 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
accordingly  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to compete effectively with its current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm its business 
the company faces risks associated with the growth and diversification of its business the company s business has grown and diversified in recent quarters and now includes a variety of professional and consumer subscription products  as well as a separate  wholly owned  broker dealer subsidiary  which offers proprietary equity research and trading to its institutional clients 
we intend to continue to grow and diversify our business  both organically and possibly through acquisitions of other companies 
such growth and diversification may require significant time and resource commitments from the company s senior management  which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to the company s existing operations 
growth in diversity and complexity may also impact our evolving business in ways we have not anticipated 
the efficient operation of the company will depend on our ability to successfully manage the increasing complexity of the commerce  publishing  financial reporting  and other systems we depend on 
acquisitions by the company could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities 
any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate the growth and diversification of the company could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
system failure may result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation the company s ability to provide timely  updated information depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems 
similarly  the company s ability to track  measure and report the delivery of advertisements on its site depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
the company s operations depend in part on the protection of its data systems and those of its third party provider against damage from human error  natural disasters  fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failure  computer viruses  acts of terrorism  vandalism  sabotage  and similar unexpected adverse events 
although the company utilizes the services of a third party data center host  there is no guarantee that the company s internet access and other data operations will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
the company s data center host filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in december and certain of its businesses  including internet hosting  are in the process of being purchased out of bankruptcy 
although the sale transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of and services are not expected to be affected  the company cannot assure you that the sale will close on schedule or that the services provided by the hosting company or its successor will continue to be at the level the company has heretofore received 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in the company s service or a decrease in responsiveness of its web sites could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation  brand and the company s relations with its advertisers and strategic partners 
the company s insurance policies may not adequately compensate the company for such losses 
in such event  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties in new product development could harm the company s business in the past few years  the company has introduced a significant number of new products and services  and expects to continue to do so 
however  the company may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent it from introducing new products and services in the future  or cause the costs to be higher than anticipated 
additionally  the company at times relies on third parties  including software companies  application service providers and technology consulting firms  to help it develop and implement new products and services 
if these third parties are not able to fulfill their responsibilities to the company on schedule or if the technology developed by them for the company s use does not function as anticipated  implementation may be delayed and costs may be higher than anticipated 
any of the foregoing occurrences could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have also invested significant resources to enhance the design  production and distribution of our products  and to accommodate the high volume of traffic we often receive as a result of important financial news events 
nevertheless  the company s web sites and distributed products have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  publishing problems  slower response times or other problems for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to choose other methods to obtain their financial and investment commentary  analysis and news 
in such a case  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
failure to establish and maintain successful strategic relationships with other companies could decrease the company s subscriber and reader base the company still relies on establishing and maintaining such relationships for a portion of its current subscriber and reader base 
there is intense competition for relationships with these firms and placement on these sites  and the company may have to pay significant fees to establish additional relationships with large  high traffic partners or maintain existing relationships in the future 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with advertisers that require us to exclusively feature these parties in sections of our web sites 
existing and future exclusivity arrangements may prevent us from entering into other advertising or sponsorship arrangements or other strategic relationships 
if the company does not successfully establish and maintain its strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if these relationships do not attract significant numbers of subscribers or readers  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties associated with the company s brand development may harm its ability to attract subscribers the company believes that maintaining and growing awareness about its products is an important aspect of its efforts to continue to attract users 
the company s new products do not have widely recognized brands  and the company will need to increase awareness of these brands among potential users 
additionally  the company s broker dealer subsidiary  independent research group llc  does not have a widely recognized brand 
the company s efforts to build brand awareness may not be cost effective or successful in reaching potential users  and some potential users may not be receptive to the company s marketing efforts or advertising campaigns 
accordingly  the company can make no assurances that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of thestreet 
com  realmoney  street insight  action alerts plus or other brands or in persuading potential users to subscribe to the company s products or potential clients to utilize the equity research and trading services of irg 
failure to maintain the company s reputation for trustworthiness may harm its business it is very important that the company maintain its reputation as a trustworthy organization 
the occurrence of events  including the company s misreporting a news story  the non disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of the company s writers  the manipulation of a security by one or more of the company s outside contributors  or other breach of the company s compliance policies  could harm the company s reputation for trustworthiness and reduce readership 
these events could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may face liability for  or incur costs to defend  information published in its products the company may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information the company publishes in its products 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
the company could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from its web sites through links to other web sites 
the company s insurance may not adequately protect it against these claims 
the company may not adequately protect its own intellectual property and may incur costs to defend against  or face liability for  intellectual property infringement claims of others to protect the company s rights to its intellectual property  the company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its employees  affiliates  customers  strategic partners and others 
the protective steps the company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  its intellectual property rights 
the company has registered several trademarks in the united states and also has pending us applications for other trademarks 
failure to adequately protect the company s intellectual property could harm its brand  devalue its proprietary content and affect its ability to compete effectively 
in addition  although the company believes that its proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against the company or claims that the company has violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
the company incorporates licensed third party technology in some of its services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have generally agreed to defend  indemnify and hold the company harmless with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right 
the company cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect it from infringement claims 
protecting the company s intellectual property rights  or defending against infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on the company s part  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties internet communications  commerce and privacy regulation 
the growth and development of the market for internet commerce and communications has prompted both federal and state laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information including consumer credit and financial information under the gramm leach bliley act  consumer protection  the content of online publications  the taxation of online transactions and the transmission of unsolicited commercial email  popularly known as spam 
more laws and regulations are under consideration by various governments  agencies and industry self regulatory groups 
although the company s compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on it  new laws and regulations may be introduced and modifications to existing laws may be enacted that require the company to make changes to its business practices 
on december  the president signed into law the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of  also known as the can spam act of this federal law  which became effective on january   pre empted the even more rigorous anti spam statute passed by the state of california in september  and established uniform standards  penalties  and an enforcement regime for the sending of unsolicited commercial email 
although the company believes that its practices are in compliance with applicable laws  regulations and policies  if the company were required to defend its practices against investigations of state or federal agencies or if the company s practices were deemed to be violative of applicable laws  regulations or policies  the company could be penalized and its activities enjoined 
any of the foregoing could increase the cost of conducting online activities  decrease demand for the company s products and services  lessen the company s ability to effectively market its products and services  or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
securities industry regulation 
over the past three years  the company s activities have evolved to include  among other things  the offering of stand alone products providing stock recommendations and analysis to subscribers  in contrast to providing such information as part of a larger online financial publication of more general and regular circulation 
as a result  the company registered in with the sec as an investment advisor under the investment advisers act of in addition  irg has registered with the sec and been admitted as a member of the nasd as a broker dealer in connection with its recently begun activities as an introducing broker and provider of proprietary and third party research 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
a failure to comply with regulations applicable to securities industry participants could materially and adversely affect the company s and irg s business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment advisors such as thestreet 
com are subject to sec regulations covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others advertising  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of advisory activities 
likewise  broker dealers are subject to regulations of the sec  state regulators and self regulatory organizations  such as the nasd  covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others recommendations of securities  equity research  execution of customers orders  capital structure  record keeping  advertising  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of securities and research activities 
violations of the regulations governing the actions of investment advisors and broker dealers may result in the imposition of censures or fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a firm  its officers  or its employees from the securities business 
the company s ability to comply with all applicable securities laws and rules is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of appropriate compliance systems including proper supervisory procedures and books and records requirements  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
furthermore  because the company operates in industries subject to extensive regulation  new regulation  changes in existing regulation  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules can have a significant impact on the company s ability to compete in the securities industry 
for example  the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and other actions by various regulatory authorities and industry organizations imposed significant new requirements on broker dealers and securities analysts issuing research reports on equity securities and their supervisors 
the requirements include an obligation to disclose conflicts and prohibitions designed to promote objectivity and independence of securities analysts 
the company does not expect these changes to materially adversely affect the growth and development of irg 
additionally  the recent scandal over late trading and market timing in the mutual fund industry has intensified regulatory scrutiny of trading and other practices of mutual funds  including the use of soft dollars to pay for research 
soft dollar practices evolved after the passage of an amendment to the exchange act that permitted money managers  so long as they followed certain rules  to pay higher than the lowest available commission rates in exchange for research products that assist them in the performance of their investment decision making responsibilities  without violating their fiduciary duty to clients to obtain the best possible execution at the lowest commission rate available 
since then  there have been sporadic efforts by regulators and industry reformers to curb or abolish the practice  which some money managers use to pay for products and services that do not fall within the rules  in potential breach of this duty 
as a result  although the mutual fund scandal has little to do with soft dollar practices  of the five mutual fund industry reform bills currently pending in congress  four  as currently drafted  would impose additional disclosure requirements on mutual funds and their investment advisers concerning their usage of soft dollars  and one  the mutual fund reform act of  would prohibit mutual funds from using them altogether 
irg s products are purely research  and thus their use by money managers in accordance with the rules is comfortably within the regulatory safe harbor for lawful and appropriate use of commissions 
however  the passage of any new or currently proposed legislation that significantly curbed or abolished soft dollar practices  or action by the sec or other federal and state governmental regulatory authorities or self regulatory organizations to further regulate the activities of broker dealers and investment advisors  could affect the company s business in the future in a manner that could harm the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
any failure of the company s internal security measures or breach of its privacy protections could cause the company to lose users and subject it to liability users who subscribe to the company s subscription based products are required to furnish certain personal information including name  mailing address  phone number  email address and credit card information  which the company uses to administer its services 
the company also requires users of some of its free products and features to provide the company with some personal information during the membership registration process 
additionally  the company relies on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real time credit card authorization and verification 
in this regard  the company s users depend on the company to keep their personal information safe and private and not to disclose it to third parties or permit its security to be breached 
if the company s users perceive that the company is not protecting their privacy  or if the information security measures of the company or its agents are breached  the company s users could be discouraged from registering to use the company s web sites or other products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
control by principal stockholders  officers and directors could adversely affect the company s stockholders the company s officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  acting together  have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to its stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets and to control its management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company  which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
volatility of the company s stock price could adversely affect the company s stockholders the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities of technology companies  particularly internet related companies  have been highly volatile 
the trading price of the company s stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
from october through december   the closing sale price of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market ranged from to 
as of march   the closing sale price was 
the company s stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in the company s markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  regardless of its operating performance 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control provisions of the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even if doing so would be beneficial to the company s stockholders 
the company does not intend to pay dividends the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock 
the company currently intends to retain any future earnings for funding growth
