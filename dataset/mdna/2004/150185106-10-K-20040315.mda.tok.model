item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the table below presents certain financial data expressed as a percent of total net revenues and selective statistical information for the periods indicated 
for the years ended december  in millions net revenues admissions food  merchandise and games accommodations and other net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization other non cash and non recurring costs interest expense provision for taxes net income selective statistical information amusement park attendance in thousands amusement park per capita spending water park attendance in thousands water park per capita spending business overview the partnership generates its revenues primarily from sales of admission to its parks  food  merchandise and games inside its parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside its parks 
the partnership s principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
the fixed nature of these costs makes attendance a key factor in the profitability of each park 
results of operations include knott s soak city palm springs and michigan s adventure since their acquisitions in late may of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements of a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
property and equipment buildings  rides and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis over each park s operating season 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
the composite method of depreciation is used for groups of assets obtained together in an acquisition 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these estimates are established based upon historical claims data and third party estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in these factors and adjustments are made to assure their adequacy 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
results of operations net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a increase over the year ended december  this followed a increase in  when revenues rose to million from million in net revenues for reflect a increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in  a increase in out of park revenues and a decrease in combined attendance across our properties to million from a record million in 
the increase in out of park revenues was from improvements in occupancy levels at our resort hotels at cedar point and knott s berry farm 
in  successful capital programs at cedar point and valleyfair  along with a record year at michigan s adventure  partially offset attendance declines at dorney park and worlds of fun resulting from poor weather and the lack of a major new attraction and an attendance decline at knott s berry farm due to continued soft tourism and heavy competition 
for the year  combined attendance at our six amusement parks totaled million  down less than from last year s record level 
at cedar point  the addition of top thrill dragster  the world s tallest and fastest roller coaster  contributed to the park s solid performance  while the introduction of the steel venom roller coaster at valleyfair helped generate record revenues at that park 
at our five water parks  improved attendance at our california properties  along with a record year at worlds of fun s water park  oceans of fun  led to a increase in combined attendance to million guests 
the increase in our overall in park guest per capita spending level in was due to solid improvements in guest spending on admissions and merchandise  as well as a shift in the mix of attendance toward higher per capita parks  such as cedar point 
the increase in net revenues in reflects a increase in combined attendance across our properties to a record million guests from million in  a increase in out of park revenues  and a slight increase in average in park guest per capita spending to from in 
successful capital programs at both cedar point and knott s berry farm  along with strong marketing programs and a record year at dorney park  boosted combined attendance at the partnership s six amusement parks in by to million guests 
at cedar point  the introduction of a new roller coaster and the addition of the new peanuts themed ice show contributed to the park s strong performance 
the introduction of the xcelerator roller coaster in july and a strong halloween haunt promotion in october led knott s berry farm to a strong second half of at our five water parks  ideal weather conditions at the midwest properties  along with a full year contribution fr om knott s soak city palm springs  led to a increase in attendance to million guests 
excluding the impact of the new park  combined water park attendance was still up from the increase in out of park revenues was driven primarily by healthy improvement in occupancy levels at cedar point s resort hotels 
cash operating costs and expenses  excluding depreciation and all non cash and non recurring charges  increased less than to million in from million in  due to a continued focus at the individual park level to control operating costs during the year 
in  these same cash operating costs and expenses increased million  or  from million in  due in part to the mid year additions of michigan s adventure and knott s soak city palm springs in all operating costs as a percent of revenues have remained relatively level between years 
a very meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and non cash and non recurring charges 
in  adjusted ebitda increased to a record million from million in and million in  due primarily to increases in average in park guest per capita spending and out of park revenues  as well as each park s ability to control operating costs 
the consolidated adjusted ebitda margin improved to in from in and in  due to costs increasing at a slower rate than revenues 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure of operating performance computed in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operating activities 
in addition  adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
other non cash and non recurring costs include several items 
in  we began accounting for unit options using the fair value method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and we recorded a million non cash charge for the year 
under our previous policy of accounting for unit options using the intrinsic value method  we recognized non cash charges of million and million in and  respectively  as we marked to market our variable priced options only 
in  under sfas no 
we expect to recognize approximately million of non cash unit option expense 
in  we recorded a million non cash charge in other expense related to the change in fair value of two of our interest rate swap agreements that could not be designated as effective hedges under the applicable accounting rules 
in  we recognized a non cash credit of million for the change in fair value of these swap agreements during the year 
the million remaining balance will reverse into income in and the first quarter of as the swaps continue to serve the purpose of leveling our cash interest costs 
in  we recorded a provision of million for the estimated portion of the net book value of certain fixed assets that might not be recoverable after they were removed from service 
after these non cash charges and credits  and interest expense and provision for taxes  both of which were comparable between years  net income for increased to million compared to million in and million in liquidity and capital resources we ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business and careful management of cash flow to reduce borrowings 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
during  cash generated from operations totaled million and new term loan borrowings provided million 
we used million for capital expenditures  million to pay down our revolving credit and term loan borrowings  and million to pay cash distributions 
at yearend  we had million of fixed rate term debt  with staggered maturities ranging from to  as well as a million revolving credit facility  which is available through march borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled million as of december  of the total term debt  million is scheduled to mature prior to december  based on interest rates in effect at yearend for variable rate debt and after giving effect to interest rate swap agreements described below  cash interest payments for would total approximately million  lower than interest paid in in addition  distributions in  at the current annual rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in for the operating season  we are investing approximately million in capital improvements at our properties  including expansions to the soak city water park and lighthouse point property at cedar point  and the addition of new intermediate sized thrill rides at knott s berry farm and worlds of fun 
in addition  we have also begun construction on a million indoor water park at cedar point and a million world class roller coaster at knott s  both of which are scheduled to open late in we are optimistic that these investments  as well as other improvements at each of the parks  will generate a high level of public interest and acceptance 
however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our parks and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain consistently high attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
in and  however  competitive discounting and soft economic conditions in our regional market areas led to virtually flat in park guest per capita spending 
credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet seasonal working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions for the foreseeable future 
the following table summarizes certain obligations at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligation long tem debt capital expenditures off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and  from time to time  currency exchange rates on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we are party to two interest rate swap agreements that convert million of revolving credit borrowings to fixed rate obligations averaging for a period of more months 
in addition  we have converted million of our term debt to variable rates averaging libor plus through the use of several swap agreements for a period of years 
as of december   of our outstanding long term debt  million represents fixed rate debt and million represents variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase annual interest expense by approximately million as of december  impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal in nature and are paid hourly rates  which although not tied directly to federal and state minimum wage laws  do follow those wage trends 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so to a large extent in the future 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor 
forward looking statements some of the statements contained in this annual report  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section  constitute forward looking statements 
these statements may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
important factors  including general economic conditions  competition for consumer spending  adverse weather conditions  unanticipated construction delays  and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations
