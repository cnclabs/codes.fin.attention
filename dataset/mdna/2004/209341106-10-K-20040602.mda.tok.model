accordingly  acquisitions affect our financial results in any one year compared to the prior year by the full year impact of prior year acquisitions as compared to the partial impact in the prior year and the partial year impact of current year acquisitions  and is referred to below as incremental contribution from acquisitions 
analysis of consolidated income statements for fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the decline in revenues is primarily attributable to comparatively weaker industry conditions versus the same period last year 
a sustained adverse effect on the commercial printing industry occurred as a result of the iraq conflict and the prolonged period of weakness in the us economy 
incremental contribution from acquisitions totaled million  substantially offsetting the sales decline attributable to weaker industry conditions 
gross profit declined by million in fiscal to million as a result of the sales decline noted above 
gross profit margin for fiscal declined slightly to from in fiscal  reflecting the comparatively weaker industry conditions we experienced in selling expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decline is directly attributable to the reduced sales levels noted above 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses for fiscal decreased slightly to from in fiscal  primarily as a result of lower sales  recruiting and hiring expenses as compared to general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased slightly to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal declined to from in fiscal generally  our fixed administrative cost structure remained relatively constant 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal includes a 
million charge to write off certain deferred financing costs  as required by generally accepted accounting principles in connection with an amendment to our bank credit facility in november see liquidity and capital resources debt obligations 
the overall decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the application of our cash flow from operations to reduce the aggregate borrowings outstanding under our various bank credit facilities 
we provided for income taxes of million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  reflecting an effective tax rate of as compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal analysis of consolidated income statements for fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the incremental impact of three printing businesses we acquired during the quarter ended march  and two printing businesses we acquired during the quarter ended june  accounted for million of the increase 
the remainder of our sales increase demonstrates the initial return on our efforts to expand market share through our recruiting program for experienced sales professionals and our pursuit of national accounts 
gross profit margin for fiscal declined to from in fiscal  reflecting continued pricing pressures caused by the overall weakness in the u 
s economy and prevailing adverse industry conditions 
further  overall gross profit margins were diluted by the gross profit margins of the printing businesses we acquired in fiscal and generally  gross profit margins of printing businesses we acquire are lower than our company s historical average and typically improve over time as we work with the management of the acquired businesses to implement cost savings strategies and other operating best practices 
selling expenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  corresponding to the higher sales levels noted above 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses for fiscal increased to from in fiscal this increase reflects our investments in recruiting and hiring new sales professionals and marketing efforts to promote our extensive printing capabilities and complementary services 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease results from our discontinuing the amortization of goodwill  which totaled million in fiscal  pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
as of april  see below 
this decrease was partially offset by higher administrative costs attributable to our recently acquired printing businesses 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal declined to from in fiscal  due to the aforementioned change in accounting for goodwill amortization  coupled with our efforts to control administrative costs and thereby leverage the higher sales levels described above 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease is due to lower borrowings outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facility  coupled with a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we also refinanced certain of our outstanding term equipment notes during the year to take further advantage of such favorable environment 
effective april   we adopted sfas no 
which required us to discontinue amortizing goodwill and perform a series of transitional impairment tests to determine if the remaining balance of goodwill of each of our reporting units  which totaled million as of march   should be reduced to reflect its estimated fair value 
we determined that each of our individual printing businesses constitutes a stand alone reporting unit under sfas no 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we recognized an after tax transitional impairment charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million  and such charge was classified as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as provided for by the new accounting standard 
further  in connection with our annual impairment test conducted as of march   as required by sfas no 
 we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in the quarter ended march  the impairment resulted principally from the impact that the continued weakness in printing industry conditions and other negative economic factors discussed above had on our reporting units 
we provided for income taxes of million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal income tax provision was reduced by a tax benefit of million related to the goodwill impairment charge noted above 
our overall effective income tax rate for fiscal decreased to as compared to in fiscal the higher tax rate of in fiscal was necessary to provide for the effect of the portion of goodwill amortization that was not deductible for tax purposes
