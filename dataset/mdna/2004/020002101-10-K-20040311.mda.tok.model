risk management  underwriting and pricing strategic risk management 
strategic risk management srm is a tier based pricing  underwriting and marketing program 
tier based pricing and underwriting produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated solely by the pre srm standard non standard model that we used 
our tier based pricing and underwriting is designed to enhance allstate s competitive position with respect to high lifetime value market segments while maintaining or improving profitability 
when implementing srm  we have introduced the use of insurance scoring based on credit history  where legally permissible  to increase the accuracy of our risk evaluation 
srm uses insurance scoring in addition to  and not instead of  other risk evaluation factors 
for automobile insurance  these other factors include  to the extent legally permissible  loss history  driving record  car year and make  and marital status 
for property insurance  these other factors include  to the extent legally permissible  loss history  condition of the property  and proximity to a fire department 
since we began using srm several years ago  our use of it has been focused primarily on acquiring and retaining new business 
we intend to continue to implement and refine srm in accordance with state regulatory processes 
we have been separating our private passenger auto insurance into standard and non standard categories for pricing and or underwriting purposes 
generally  standard customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard customers 
but our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into these categories 
in some states  we have implemented srm and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what might be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan  which might be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks 
as the implementation of srm continues  the distinctions between standard and non standard may become less important in certain states  depending upon how srm is implemented 
lifetime value 
we regard lifetime value as the discounted value of a customer s future cash flow stream 
to compute a customer s lifetime value score  we analyze characteristics about the customer for example  age  marital status and driving record and the product the customer has purchased for example  coverages  limits  and descriptors of the asset insured on the basis of historic data patterns and trends 
because future loss and retention patterns of customers vary significantly  the distribution of lifetime values for a large group of customers will vary from very negative to very positive 
high lifetime value generally refers to customers who have above average lifetime values 
involuntary 
the allstate protection segment participates in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance business 
this business provides auto insurance to individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain it due to their driving records or other factors 
like all auto insurers  allstate is required to write or share the cost of this business in order to maintain its licenses to do business in many states 
retention 
as is true for the industry in general  costs attributable to our personal property and casualty products are generally higher during the first year an insurance policy is in effect than in subsequent years 
certain costs of issuing an insurance policy  such as processing and inspection expenses generally occur only in the first year the policy is in force 
policies that remain in force generally become more profitable over time 
accordingly  customer retention is an important factor in the segment s profitability and a key element of our strategy in this business 
claims in the allstate protection segment we seek to efficiently pay fair and correct amounts on all claims on a timely basis 
as part of this effort  we employ strategies focused on specific segments of the claim adjustment process and we use the expertise and services provided by vendors where appropriate 
we continue to research  develop and implement strategies to improve the cost effectiveness of our claim processes  to leverage our scale and buying power  to leverage our use of technology  to reduce operational costs  to improve process management and to enhance service for our customers 
allstate s efficient management of the claims process helps maintain competitive and profitable insurance pricing 
distribution the allstate protection segment sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance primarily through agencies 
the allstate brand products are sold primarily through allstate exclusive agencies and  to a lesser extent  through independent agencies in areas not served by exclusive agencies 
however  in those states where we have implemented the good hands network  consumers can also purchase certain allstate personal insurance products and obtain service through our customer information centers and  in many of those states  over the internet 
the good hands network a multi access platform that integrates the local allstate exclusive agencies  the internet and our customer information centers is available in states and the district of columbia to over of the united states population 
in some states where we have implemented the good hands network  but where customers cannot use the internet to purchase our products  they can use it to get information and service on a limited basis 
our ivantage business sells encompass sm and deerbrook brand products through independent agencies 
the encompass brand includes standard private passenger auto and homeowners insurance products while the deerbrook brand includes non standard private passenger auto insurance 
our broad based network of approximately  allstate exclusive agencies in approximately  locations in the us produced approximately of the allstate protection segment s written premiums in the rest was generated primarily by approximately  independent agencies

geographic markets the principal geographic markets for our personal property and casualty products are in the united states 
through various subsidiaries  we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance in all states  the district of columbia and canada 
the following table reflects  in percentages  the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the segment for the year ended december  no other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the premiums earned for the allstate protection segment 
texas california new york florida our underwriting strategy for homeowners insurance is to target customers whose risk of loss provides allstate with the best opportunity for profitable growth 
this includes managing exposure on policies in geographic areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels

that table is incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
risk management  underwriting and pricing for individual life insurance policies  we use detailed and uniform underwriting policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of each applicant 
in some cases we require medical examinations and in some cases we may order attending physicians statements and consumer investigative reports 
for supplemental accident and health insurance products  we use a more simplified underwriting approach 
structured settlement annuities and immediate annuities are underwritten using recent mortality experience and an assumption of continued improvement in annuitant longevity 
some of our life insurance policies allow us to adjust charges and credits  generally  to reflect changes from expected mortality and expense experience or higher or lower investment returns 
however  we are subject to contractual maximum charges and minimum crediting rates and state regulatory limits on increasing charges after a policy is issued 
we price our personal life insurance  retirement and investment products at issuance to achieve a target return on required capital based on assumptions regarding mortality  expenses  investment return  persistency  required reserves and capital 
our assumptions are based on regular reviews of our experience in this business 
periodically  we revise in force products through non guaranteed charges or credits to reflect changes in experience and to preserve the margins originally priced into the product 
for funding agreements  our risk management strategy is based on using sophisticated systems and processes to project expected cash flows for assets and liabilities and to measure the sensitivity of asset and liability cash flows to interest rate changes 
managing interest rate exposure to control the duration match of assets and liabilities 
in other words  closely matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes when feasible  often by using derivative financial instruments 
primarily writing contracts with predictable maturity structures and without credit event triggers  cross default acceleration clauses or premature surrender or redemption provisions 
monitoring withdrawal activity to detect deviations from expected cash flows 
establishing multi disciplinary working groups of professionals with expertise in investment  sales  financial and pricing management to manage risk 
distribution the allstate financial segment distributes its products through various distribution channels  as described below 
this multi channel distribution strategy results in a broad distribution network and increases operating flexibility while allowing us to focus our marketing efforts 
independent agents 
through master brokerage agencies  we use independent agents to distribute term life insurance  universal life insurance  variable universal life insurance  fixed annuities immediate and deferred  including indexed  variable annuities and long term care insurance 
allstate exclusive agencies 
through allstate agencies  we use exclusive agents and exclusive financial specialists to increase sales of our personal life insurance  retirement and investment products 
the products distributed through this channel include term life insurance  whole life insurance  universal life insurance  variable universal life insurance  deferred fixed annuities  variable annuities  long term care insurance  disability income insurance  cancer insurance  certificates of deposit  money market accounts  savings accounts  checking accounts  first mortgage loans and non proprietary mutual funds 
broker dealers 
through broker dealers across the country  we target consumers who want assistance in investing for retirement 
the products that we distribute through broker dealers include fixed annuities deferred  including indexed  variable annuities and single premium variable life insurance 
we have established distribution arrangements with most national broker dealers and regional firms and with many independent broker dealers 
financial institutions 
we also use financial institutions across the country to target consumers who want assistance in investing for retirement 
the products that we distribute through financial institutions include fixed annuities deferred  including indexed  variable annuities  single premium fixed life insurance and single premium variable life insurance 
we have established distribution arrangements with a growing number of leading financial institutions 
direct marketing 
in  we continued to use direct marketing techniques such as telemarketing and direct mail to distribute primarily term life insurance  accidental death insurance and hospital indemnity products 
however  we intend to dispose of this distribution channel in workplace marketing 
through workplace marketing  we target employees primarily of small and medium size firms 
we examine the benefit programs offered by these firms and recommend personal insurance products that complement and supplement their existing plans 
then we offer the recommended products to the employees on a voluntary participation basis  with premiums paid through payroll deductions 
the insurance products that we sell through workplace marketing include universal life  term life  disability income  cancer  accident  critical illness  heart stroke  hospital indemnity  limited benefit medical and dental insurance 
institutional investors funding agreements 
primarily  we sell funding agreements directly to variable interest entities that issue medium term notes through investment banks to investors seeking high quality  fixed income investments 
however  we also sell funding agreements  directly or through specialized brokers  to short term institutional money managers seeking high quality investments with reasonable liquidity 
approximately of our funding agreement sales are derived from transactions in which a variable interest entity purchases a funding agreement with terms similar to those of notes issued by the variable interest entity to institutional investors 
the level of funding agreement sales to variable interest entities is dependent on conditions in the capital markets 
as a result  sales of funding agreements can vary widely from one reporting period to another 
structured settlement annuities 
we have relationships with several structured settlement brokers and brokerage firms across the country 
in addition  a significant number of the structured settlement annuities that we sold in originated with cases referred from claims activity in our allstate protection segment 
the following table lists the allstate financial segment s major distribution channels with the associated primary products and targeted customers

we sell funding agreements in the united states and in the cayman islands 
however  in the cayman islands  our distribution is generally limited to selling funding agreements to support medium term note programs 
the following table reflects  in percentages  the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the allstate financial segment for the year ended december   based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments 
approximately of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations generated in delaware represent deposits received in connection with funding agreements sold to a variable interest entity domiciled in delaware 
no other jurisdiction accounted for more than five percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations 
delaware california new york florida texas pennsylvania competition with regard to our personal life insurance  retirement  investment and supplemental accident and health insurance products  we compete principally on the basis of the scope of our distribution systems  the breadth of our product offerings  the recognition of our brands  our financial strength and ratings  our product features and prices  and the level of customer service that we provide 
in addition  with respect to variable life and variable annuity products  we compete on the basis of the variety of providers and choices of funds for our separate accounts and the management and performance of those funds within our separate accounts 
the market for these products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive 
as of december   there were approximately groups of life insurance companies in the united states  most of which offered one or more products similar to the allstate financial segment s products 
based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments  as of december   the allstate financial segment ranked th based on ordinary life insurance in force and th based on statutory admitted assets 
in some states  we compete with banks and savings and loan associations in the sale of life insurance products 
in addition  because many of these products include a savings or investment component  our competition includes securities firms  investment advisors  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
competitive pressure is growing due to several factors  including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses  as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry 
other business segments our corporate and other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non insurance operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the revenues  income from operations  and identifiable assets attributable to our corporate and other segment over the last three years 
our discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other business in run off 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment

reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis 
the end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the second table presents reserves on a net after reinsurance basis 
the total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for gaap reporting and a liability for billion that represents a deposit on assumed reinsurance from the acquisition of cna s personal lines business  now called encompass 
additional differences are caused by the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for billion  which are not included in the combined united states statutory statement 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of increased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions on gross reserve reestimates 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the increase in net reserves established for december  through december  reflects unfavorable reestimates as more fully discussed below 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions by accident year total prior total favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in through were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the seven years for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs 
the impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude 
beginning in the early s  lower medical cost inflation rates  as evidenced by the consumer price index cpi published by the bureau of labor statistics for medical costs  have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates 
from through  the medical cpi averaged  and from through  the average declined to 
the medical cpi is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies  including doctors fees  emergency care  therapy and rehabilitation  and pharmaceuticals  all of which are covered claims for insureds 
in  the medical cpi increased to  and most recent economic forecasts anticipate further increases in medical inflation 
if this occurs  future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates 
over time  our loss management programs have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends 
we have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims  consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims  more accurate valuation of damages  and more effective negotiation and defense practices 
these improvements have also involved hiring additional staff  providing increased training  creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims  and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims  claims with attorney involvement  and claims in litigation 
these programs were intended to create an improved culture  focused on expert  efficient  and effective claim process management 
since  growth of allstate s injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results 
we believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements  and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates 
while changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims  these changes can impact historical patterns of losses  introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims 
in and  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in  were due to favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates  offset by unfavorable increases related to asbestos  and other discontinued lines 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses related to asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation 
in the us the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency and define standards of conduct 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of insurance policyholders rather than security holders 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of arizona  california  florida  illinois  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in arizona  california  illinois  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit history for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups in various states 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
as of december  the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries did not contain any investments that were non admitted for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  some states limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department and not disapproved on the grounds that it could lead to market disruption 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  the national association of securities dealers and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
regulation and legislation affecting consolidation in the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley act of permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms within one holding company group 
until passage of the gramm leach bliley act  the glass steagall act of had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses and the bank holding company act of had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers 
with the passage of the gramm leach bliley act  bank holding companies may acquire insurers and insurance holding companies may acquire banks 
in addition  grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies  including our parent company  may engage in activities that are not financial in nature 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a unitary thrift holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the thrift holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the law of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal and state law also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
tax 
state and federal laws affect the taxation of insurance companies 
congress and various state legislatures have occasionally considered proposals that  if enacted  could impose a greater tax burden on allstate 
asbestos 
recently congress has considered comprehensive federal legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation 
however  unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
we cannot predict the impact on our results of operations  liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to pay for clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so and to assign liability to prps 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  but only modest reform measures have been enacted

it is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows 
for a more complete discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and estimates relating to these policies  see the referenced sections of the md a 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see note of the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation the fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
factors used in our internally developed models  such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities are difficult to observe and to characterize 
because of this  judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and  as a result  the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities 
periodic changes in fair values of investments classified as available for sale other than those accounted for under the cost or equity method are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party  or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security s fair value is performed on a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent when assessing impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances or new information that we obtain which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is held at fair value and as a result  the related unrealized loss  net of tax  would already be reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
for a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment  and the potential causes of such changes  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the investments  market risk and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a 
derivative instrument hedge effectiveness in the normal course of business  we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset liability management  primarily in the allstate financial segment 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
when derivatives meet specific criteria  they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value  cash flow  foreign currency fair value  or foreign currency cash flow hedges 
when designating a derivative as an accounting hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship  risk management objective and strategy 
the documentation identifies the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
we do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment 
at each reporting date  we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk 
the determination of whether a hedging instrument is effective both at its inception and on an on going basis requires a significant degree of judgment 
for further discussion of these policies and quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the investments  market risk and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a 
deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned  generally for periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance and other premium paying contracts is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as to all other aspects of dac are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issue and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels  and any estimated premium deficiencies  change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization period for these contracts approximates the estimated lives of the contracts 
dac related to interest sensitive life  variable annuities and investment contracts is amortized in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
generally  the amortization period ranges from years 
however  an assumption for the rate of contract surrenders is also used  which results in the majority of the dac being amortized over the surrender charge period 
the rate of amortization during the surrender charge period is matched to the assumed pattern of egp 
egp consists of estimates of the following components margins from mortality including guaranteed minimum death and income benefits  investment margin including realized capital gains and losses  and contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  less maintenance expenses 
the most significant assumptions involved in determining egp are the expected separate accounts fund performance after fees  surrender rates  lapse rates  and investment and mortality margins 
our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance after fees is approximately  which is consistent with our pricing assumptions 
whenever actual separate accounts fund performance  based on the two most recent years  varies from  we create an estimate of performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over that seven year period equals the long term assumption 
this process is referred to as a reversion to the mean and is commonly used by the life insurance industry 
although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry  the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies 
for example  when applying this assumption we do not allow the future rates of return after fees projected over the five year period to exceed or fall below 
revisions to egps result in changes in the amounts expensed as a component of amortization of dac in the period in which the revision is made 
this is commonly known as dac unlocking 
for quantification of the impact of these estimates and assumptions on allstate financial  see the allstate financial segment and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation the property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the reporting date 
allstate protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar cases  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs and product mix 
in addition  the reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements  economic conditions  and public attitudes 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process 
because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the highest degree of uncertainty in estimating incurred losses is associated with reserves for the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled  and that must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
that proportion diminishes in subsequent years 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates  which may be material  are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determinable 
we believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for losses that have occurred but have not been reported to us yet 
the aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience  and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainties as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure  unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  evolving and expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  the availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  estimations of the extent and timing of any contractual liability  and other uncertainties 
there are complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulation 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when estimating the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period

property liability highlights premiums written  an operating measure that is defined and reconciled to premiums earned on page  reached a record billion during compared to last year  premiums written increased due to increases in the allstate brand standard auto and homeowners average premiums and the number of policies in force pif 
allstate brand standard auto new business premiums increased and homeowners new business premiums increased 
the continued implementation of strategic risk management srm  a multi phase strategy that integrates tier based pricing  underwriting and marketing decisions  resulted in a growing percentage of new business customers who are expected to provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
this improved lifetime value is a result of better loss ratios and higher retention of these customers 
underwriting income for property liability was billion in compared to million in  with a combined ratio improvement of points to these improvements were a result of earned premium growth  favorable claim frequency and lower prior year reserve reestimates  but were partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and increased severity of current year claims for both the allstate brand and ivantage 
as a result of profit improvement actions  the ivantage combined ratio improved points in to and the number of ivantage standard auto and homeowners pif declined and  respectively compared to december  property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection is comprised of two lines of business  the allstate brand and ivantage  and is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting income  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income on page  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses  restructuring and related charges  and in  the amortization of goodwill  as determined using gaap 
this is one of the measures we use in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
underwriting income loss should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure 
summarized financial data  key operating ratios and a reconciliation of underwriting income loss to net income for our property liability operations for the years ended december  are presented in the following table 
in millions  except ratios premiums written    revenues premiums earned    net investment income    realized capital gains and losses total revenues    costs and expenses claims and claims expense    amortization of dac    operating costs and expenses    amortization of goodwill restructuring and related charges total costs and expenses    gain loss on disposition of operations income tax expense benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  after tax net income   underwriting income loss net investment income    income tax expense on operations realized capital gains and losses  after tax gain loss on disposition of operations  after tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  after tax net income   catastrophe losses  operating ratios claims and claims expense loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio effect of catastrophe losses on loss ratio effect of restructuring and related charges on expense ratio effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio allstate protection segment overview and strategy our goal for the allstate protection segment is to grow profitably and improve and sustain the profitability of our auto and homeowners insurance products 
we are seeking  through the utilization of srm  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide above average profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
we have also aligned agency management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand by basing certain incentives on profitability  growth and sales of allstate financial products 
in  we have implemented and will maintain a broader marketing approach throughout the us these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and enhancing the good hands network 
the ivantage business sells private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals through independent agencies 
ivantage includes standard auto and homeowners products with the encompass sm brand name and non standard auto products with the deerbrook brand name 
our strategy for ivantage focuses on improving profitability for both encompass and deerbrook  and growing in select markets  in part by using srm 
the integration of encompass policies onto allstate brand systems has resulted in a different counting process for policies in force 
as a result  recorded variances to prior year policies in force and average premium may be subject to some distortion until the integration is completed 
the tier based pricing and underwriting used in srm produces a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by our pre srm standard non standard model that we used and it is designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential for these customers 
our rating plans for private passenger auto insurance are no longer consistently segregated into standard plans and non standard plans 
in some states  we have implemented srm and modified our underwriting criteria in a way that allows us to write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan  which may also be considered a standard rating plan designed to accommodate non standard risks 
as the implementation of srm continues  the distinctions between standard and non standard may become less important in certain states  depending upon how srm is implemented 
for this reason we are shifting our managerial focus to auto  including standard auto and non standard auto 
however  we will continue to provide results for standard and non standard auto 
generally  standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers 
for allstate brand standard auto and homeowners business written under srm  our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who have lower loss ratios 
the impact of srm on our non standard business has been less pronounced because the impact has been mitigated by the effect of other non standard business initiatives  and as described above  because the implementation of srm has meant that in some states we write what may be considered both standard and non standard business with one rating plan 
because the implementation of srm began in and has applied primarily to new business written since that time  today it accounts for about of total premiums written 
this amount will continue to increase since over of new business is written using srm rating plans 
another element of our strategy for our homeowners insurance business is to target customers whose risk of loss provides the best opportunity for profitable growth  including managing exposure on policies in areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels 
homeowners product pricing is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period of years 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze events not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe  are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
accordingly  homeowners products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
allstate protection s goal is to achieve pricing targets comprising a competitive combined ratio and return on equity 
our primary strategies to achieve this goal include continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all allstate protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained  and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and deerbrook auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes taken during and will generally be recognized as premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position

the increase in the allstate brand standard auto average premium in when compared to is primarily due to higher average renewal premiums 
higher average renewal premiums relate to rate actions taken in the current and prior year and  to a lesser degree  a normal shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos 
the increases in new business premiums  pif and the renewal ratio in compared to are due to an improved loss ratio driving more modest need for rate increases and to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the us declines in when compared to were primarily due to administrative and risk management actions taken to improve the standard auto loss ratio 
these actions included implementing premium rate increases  down payment requirements and other underwriting changes in several large standard auto premium states 
ivantage standard auto premiums written increased in both and compared to the prior years due to profit improvement actions resulting in increased average premium per policy  partially offset by fewer new and renewal policies in force 
increased average premiums per policy were related to rate actions taken during the last three years

declines in allstate brand non standard auto new and renewal business premiums during and were primarily due to a decline in pif 
this decline was due to increases from new business pif being offset by the declines in pif related to an inherently low renewal ratio in this business  and to a lesser extent to a shift in writing business previously reported as non standard as standard auto using srm 
the increase in average premium during both years was due primarily to higher average renewal premiums due to rate actions 
ivantage non standard renewal business premiums increased in due to the re entry of deerbrook in the non standard market during since december   deerbrook has been writing business in states and consequently more stable trends in new business premiums  pif and average premium have emerged in when compared to the prior year 
the trends in non standard auto premiums are primarily due to the implementation of programs to address adverse profitability trends for both the allstate brand and ivantage 
these actions varied by state and included changes to premium down payment requirements  tighter underwriting requirements  rate increases and certain other administrative actions 
as a result  our competitive pricing position has declined 
these trends are expected to continue  although at a lower rate  as we remain committed to profitable growth and focused on the utilization of srm

allstate protection generated underwriting income of million during compared to an underwriting loss of million in the increase in underwriting income was the result of increased premiums earned  lower catastrophe losses and declines in auto and homeowners claim frequency  partially offset by increased current year claim severity and prior year reserve reestimates 
changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during was lower than the relevant medical cost indices  while during it was higher than the relevant medical cost indices 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim settlement process  medical management programs  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various loss management initiatives underway  contribute positively to the mitigation of injury severity trends 
however  auto injury claim severity could offset the success of these programs as was seen in  therefore  we will continue to pursue claim mitigation programs and profitability actions such as rate increases 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the body work price index and the used car price index 
in and  our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally higher than the weighted index 
we believe that results can be favorably impacted by the application of enhanced claim settlement practices for auto physical damage claims 
accordingly  we continue to pursue various loss management initiatives that we expect to contribute positively to the mitigation of physical damage severity trends 
however  during and the increase in auto physical damage claim severity more than offset the success of these programs 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  and other economic and environmental factors 
in we experienced a decline in homeowners severity while in we experienced an increase 
additional losses in were due to an increase in the volume of mold claims in texas totaling million 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors  however  homeowners severity may increase  offsetting the success of these programs 
we have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio 
for example  we have implemented policy language in texas and the majority of other states limiting payments for mold claims to  for specified remediation of mold that results from a covered water loss 
loss ratios the percentage of losses to premiums earned are a measure of profitability

non standard auto loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and points for ivantage in when compared to these declines were due to lower claim frequency  favorable reserve reestimates and higher premiums earned in ivantage  partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and higher claim severities 
in  the allstate brand loss ratio declined points  while the ivantage loss ratio increased points 
these fluctuations were due to lower claim frequency  offset by lower premiums earned in the allstate brand and higher losses in ivantage 
auto loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and points for ivantage in when compared to these declines were due to higher premiums earned and lower claim frequency and favorable reserve reestimates  partially offset by higher catastrophe losses and claim severity 
in  the allstate brand loss ratio declined points and the ivantage loss ratio declined points when compared to the declines in were due to increased premiums earned  lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency  partially offset by higher severity 
homeowners loss ratio declined points for the allstate brand and increased points for ivantage in when compared to these fluctuations were due to higher premiums earned  lower claim frequency and lower reserve reestimates for the allstate brand  including lower than anticipated losses in texas related to mold claims  offset by increased catastrophe losses  higher claim severity and higher reserve reestimates for ivantage 
allstate brand incurred losses related to mold claims in texas were negligible in compared to losses of million in and million in in  the allstate brand loss ratio declined points and the ivantage loss ratio declined points when compared to the declines in were due to increased premiums earned  and lower catastrophe losses  partially offset by increased reserve reestimates related to prior years and higher mold related claims in the state of texas 
for homeowners  we implemented programs such as market or state specific product designs  rate increases  underwriting and rating changes  discontinuation of specific coverages  specific policy language clarifying coverage for mold claims and loss management initiatives to improve the profitability of this business 
because of the success of these programs we have returned this business to profitability during  although in the future volatility in underwriting results caused by losses from events such as catastrophes may occur 
we will continue these programs and introduce others to maintain profitability 
expense ratio for allstate protection increased in compared to after declining in from levels 
the increase in was due to higher agent incentives  marketing expenditures  charitable contributions and employee related expenses 
the decline in was due to various expense management initiatives partially offset by an increase in periodic pension costs 
the impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table 
allstate brand ivantage amortization of dac other costs and expenses amortization of goodwill restructuring and related charges total expense ratio the expense ratio for the standard auto and homeowners businesses generally approximate the total allstate protection expense ratio of in  in and in the expense ratio for the non standard auto business generally is to points lower than the total allstate protection expense ratio due to lower agent commission rates and higher average premiums for non standard auto as compared to standard auto 
the ivantage expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the allstate brand due to higher commission rates  integration expenses and expenditures for technology 
allstate protection underwriting income was impacted in  and by restructuring charges 
for a more detailed discussion of these charges  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
net income was also favorably impacted in and by adjustments for prior year tax liabilities totaling million and million  respectively 
dac we establish a dac asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business  principally agents remuneration  premium taxes  certain underwriting costs and direct mail solicitation expenses 
for the allstate protection business  dac is amortized to income consistent with the timeframes in which premiums are earned 
the balance of dac for each product type at december  is included in the following table 
allstate brand ivantage total allstate protection in millions standard auto non standard auto auto homeowners other personal lines total dac     catastrophe losses are an inherent risk of the property liability insurance industry that have contributed  and will continue to contribute  to potentially material year to year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position 
we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pre tax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes  wildfires  tornadoes  hailstorms  hurricanes  tropical storms  high winds and winter storms 
we are also exposed to human made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
we include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense 
as a result  catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios 
during  catastrophe losses totaled billion  compared to catastrophe losses of million in and million in over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
actions we have taken to limit our exposure include restricting the amount and location of new business  limiting the availability of certain policy coverages  employing policy brokering  and increasing our participation in catastrophe pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be mitigated by the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations 
we have also requested and received rate increases and have expanded the use of hurricane  tropical cyclone and earthquake deductibles in certain regions that are subject to high levels of catastrophes 
we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to be major metropolitan centers near the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states  and the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be california  areas surrounding the new madrid fault system in the midwest and faults in and surrounding seattle  washington and charleston  south carolina 
for further disclosure of our participation in the florida hurricane catastrophe fund  citizens property insurance corporation and the california earthquake authority  which limit our exposure to catastrophes in certain areas  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
historical catastrophe experience in the last years  the average annual impact of catastrophes on our property liability loss ratio was pts 
however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now substantially covered by the cea  fhcf or brokered to a third party 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was during the last years 
comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio over the last years  excluding losses from hurricane andrew  california earthquakes and hawaii hurricanes during that period was points  with an impact of in areas bordering the eastern and gulf coasts with hurricane exposure and an impact of in all other areas 
the question of the impact of global climate change is an on going topic of discussion and so we continue to evaluate credible scientific evidence regarding the potential effect of climate change on our business 
allstate protection outlook we expect to see continued premium growth during as the result of increases in allstate brand standard auto and homeowners pif 
increased pif is related to our pursuit of a broader marketing approach in most of the us  including underwriting to additional srm risk tiers  increased advertising and growth in the number and size of allstate exclusive agencies 
because of our profitable results in  we expect the level of premium rate changes in will diminish 
we do not expect to experience significant premium growth in ivantage during while we continue to pursue profitability actions in this business 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results 
we will continue to examine our expenses for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
any reductions in costs we achieve  however  may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives  such as increased expenditures for advertising and technology 
in addition  other factors may increase our expenses  including an adverse market impact on net periodic pension cost  increases in other benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments 
discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off

our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment 
summarized underwriting results for the years ended december  are presented in the following table 
in millions premiums written premiums earned claims and claims expense other costs and expenses restructuring and related charges underwriting loss during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reserve increases for asbestos totaling million 
our annual ground up review of reserves for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures resulted in an increase in asbestos reserves totaling million 
during the year  asbestos reserves were also increased million due to new information received for two manufacturing insureds in bankruptcy  and by million for an excess insurance policyholder who submitted new and unanticipated claims that were for previously not designated  and therefore unexpected  coverage years 
reserves for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable and bad debts were increased by million 
the cost of administering claims settlements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the underwriting loss was also primarily due to our annual review of reserves for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures  resulting in an increase in reserves totaling million  including increases for asbestos of million  environmental of million  other discontinued lines of million  and costs of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures of million 
see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves discussion for a more detailed description of our reserving practices 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future 
these potential losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information becoming known relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
because of our annual ground up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
property liability investment results net investment income increased in when compared to last year  after decreasing in when compared to in  the increase was due to higher portfolio balances resulting from positive cash flows from operations and investment activities and higher income from partnerships  mostly offset by lower portfolio yields 
in  the decrease was due to lower portfolio yields and lower income from partnership interests  partially offset by higher portfolio balances due to positive cash flows from operations and investment activities 
during  we sold approximately billion of the property liability equity securities portfolio 
the proceeds of this sale were invested in fixed income securities  which generated higher net investment income 
the following table presents the average pre tax investment yields for the year ended december fixed income securities tax exempt fixed income securities tax exempt equivalent fixed income securities taxable equity securities mortgage loans total portfolio pre tax yield is calculated as annualized investment income including dividend income in the case of equity securities divided by the average of the beginning and end of period investment balances

investment outlook the property liability investment portfolio relies upon positive cash flows to support investment purchases 
cash flows available for investment can be impacted by volatility in underwriting results and the level of dividends paid by allstate insurance company aic to the allstate corporation 
the amount of cash flow available to invest directly impacts the amount of property liability net investment income 
allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due  in part  to the reinvestment of proceeds from security prepayments  calls and maturities  and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate 
property liability claims and claims expense reserves underwriting results of property liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
we describe our reserve process in the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a and note of the consolidated financial statements 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims 
the actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates 
the primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period 
the development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves 
the difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate 
reserves are reestimated quarterly 
when new development factors are calculated from actual losses  and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates  assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors 
changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates 
over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately million in net income 
a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately million 
for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
for allstate protection  at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because  at the end of the current accident year  the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated  is higher than it will be as time elapses 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves estimated losses for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter

this resulted in reserve reestimates including million related to ibnr  million related to claim severity and million related to mold claims in texas 
in addition  reserves were increased million for settlement of losses remaining from the northridge earthquake

the allstate brand experienced million of unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates in this was primarily due to million of homeowners reestimates resulting from claim severity development and late reported losses that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates  including million related to mold claims in texas and million for settlement of losses remaining from the northridge earthquake 
reestimates of reserves from prior years for auto and other businesses were about million for the year  of which million was for canadian business reserves 
these reestimates were primarily due to increasing inflationary pressures on auto severities and for some of the small non auto products 
reserve reestimates for the allstate brand claims in included a million increase in the accident year losses offset by million of net favorable reestimates for all prior years 
approximately million of unfavorable reestimates for accident year losses was the result of unusually bad weather experienced at year end  coupled with an unanticipated number of late reported claims 
the remainder of the accident year loss reestimate was primarily attributable to increased severity for homeowner losses including mold related losses in texas 
for accident years prior to  the net reestimate of million included million of adverse reestimates for northridge related losses and million of other litigation related adverse reestimates  offset by favorable reestimates 
the preceding trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends  based on the indications of updated development factor calculations

using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders 
reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages  as shown in the table below  were increased primarily for asbestos in and  and for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines losses in in millions jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate asbestos claims environmental claims other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages   underwriting loss income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income reserve additions for asbestos in  totaling million  were primarily for products related coverage 
this increase essentially was a result of more claimants being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims and new claims being reported in our assumed reinsurance business 
this trend is consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry 
we believe it is related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation  potential congressional activity and bankruptcy actions 
during  reserve reestimates included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off  and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
in  asbestos reserves were increased by million primarily due to final settlement of exposure to an insured and adverse reestimates on other estimated asbestos losses due to an increase in claims from smaller more peripheral exposures 
pending asbestos claims related to excess policies issued to manufacturers that have filed for bankruptcy protection also increased to a minor extent 
reserve reestimates also included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
in  our annual review resulted in a million reestimate of asbestos reserves due to increased emergence of reported losses 
this was partially offset by a million favorable reestimate of environmental reserves and million of favorable reestimates in other discontinued lines due to improving loss emergence trends in these areas 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large united states companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on fortune companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
liability for actual and potential asbestos losses has caused a number of companies to file for bankruptcy protection 
of companies that filed for bankruptcy as a result of significant asbestos exposure  on a direct both primary and excess insurance basis  we did not insure settled with reserved to excess insurance policy limits on reserved to maximum mutual agreed upon exposure on appropriately reserved for the remaining although we do not believe a greater exposure is probable for the remaining  our maximum additional exposure to full policy limits for the remaining in the aggregate is million  after tax 
reserves related to asbestos manufacturers in bankruptcy  whose claims are still in the process of resolution  are established based on claims that have occurred and other related information 
the claim resolution process in these bankruptcies is lengthy and involves  among other factors  filing notices of claim by all current claimants  evaluating pre petition and post petition claims  negotiations among the various creditor groups and the debtors and  if necessary  evidentiary hearings by the bankruptcy court 
we will continue to monitor the relevant bankruptcies 
our exposure  if any  to bankruptcies of major asbestos manufacturers  including any currently in bankruptcy  would also arise if assumed reinsurance was written for an insurer providing insurance protection to a major asbestos manufacturer  and then only in proportion to our participation share 
we assess our potential liability to each of our reinsurance programs and adjust reserves accordingly based on our knowledge of the losses of each reinsured exposure 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
the table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before gross and after net the effects of reinsurance for the past three years 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims beginning reserves incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves   annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims beginning reserves incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims annual survival ratio year survival ratio percentage of ibnr in ending reserves the survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year 
this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in  the asbestos survival ratios increased improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments 
the environmental survival ratios decreased slightly due to a lower reserve balance 
in  both the asbestos and environmental survival ratios declined due to an increase in claims paid and reduced reserve levels  primarily due to commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements that  in turn  caused increased claim payments and reduced reserve levels 
the total commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for  and excluding these commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements  are represented in the following table 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims total commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements is viewed to be a more representative  prospective measure of current reserve adequacy than other survival ratio calculations 
now at years for asbestos as of december   we consider it to represent a strong reserve position 
a one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at december  would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately million 
our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table

during the last three years  direct primary and excess policyholders reported new claims  and policyholders were closed  increasing the number of active policyholders by during the period 
the increase comprised from  from and from the increase of from included new policyholders reporting new claims and policyholders claims were closed 
reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended december   totaled million and included the following factors direct primary insurance net reserves increased by million 
we were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis 
direct excess insurance net reserves increased by million for policyholders with existing active claims 
the increase in existing active claims was attributable to an increase in the number of claims filed against direct excess insureds 
assumed reinsurance net reserves increased by million for increased cessions as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
many of the insureds that reported claims to us on their direct excess insurance coverages also reported claims to carriers included in our assumed reinsurance exposure 
the number of reported new claims is shown in the following table 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  new claims new claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies 
ibnr net reserves increased by million in anticipation of continued claims activity 
at december  ibnr represented of total asbestos reserves  points higher than at december  ibnr reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new direct active insurance policyholders and ceding companies 
our non products case reserves represent approximately of total asbestos case reserves 
we do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded 
we did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure 
for environmental exposures a comprehensive ground up review  using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review  is also conducted in the third quarter of each year 
the analysis performed in produced essentially no change in reserve estimates 
environmental loss emergence in was primarily due to losses from one large reinsurance contract and a few other direct losses 
in past years environmental reestimates have been favorable 
pending  new  total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
number of claims asbestos pending  beginning of year    new   total closed pending  end of year    closed without payment environmental pending  beginning of year    new  total closed    pending  end of year    closed without payment   our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we are unable to determine the effect  if any  that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position 
reserves for other discontinued lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  and are presented in the following table 
in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued primary  excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
another comprehensive ground up review will be completed in the third quarter of  as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves 
property liability reinsurance ceded we participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including both voluntary and mandatory industry pools and facilities  and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
gross claims and claims expense reserves reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims  net in millions mandatory industry pools and facilities asbestos and environmental   other   total property liability     we purchase reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer  as well as the terms and price of coverage 
estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
recently there has also been consolidation activity between some of our carriers and potential carriers in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future

all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial highlights allstate financial revenues increased in compared to this increase was primarily due to lower net capital losses in excluding net capital losses  revenues increased in to billion primarily due to increased net investment income 
net income increased to million in from a net loss of million in this increase was primarily due to the impact of the change in accounting principle for goodwill that resulted in a charge of million  after tax  and lower net realized capital losses in  partly offset by higher income tax expense and an increased loss on disposition of operations 
investments  including separate accounts assets  increased to billion due primarily to strong contractholder funds deposits and increases in separate accounts balances resulting from improved equity market performance during the year 
contractholder funds deposits totaled billion for compared to billion in the increase of billion was primarily attributable to fixed annuity and institutional product deposits

contract charges are revenues generated from interest sensitive life products  variable annuities  fixed annuities and other investment products for which deposits are classified as contractholder funds or separate accounts liabilities 
contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance  administration  cost of insurance and surrender prior to contractually specified dates 
as a result  changes in contractholder funds and separate accounts liabilities are considered in the evaluation of growth and as indicators of future levels of revenues

the decline in premiums from our direct response business reflects management actions over the past two years to discontinue this business 
the decline in traditional life premium reflects a shift in product sales from traditional whole life policies to term insurance  which has lower premiums and where we utilize more ceded reinsurance 
the decline in immediate annuities with life contingencies was a result of underwriting actions to reduce the size of certain types of individual contracts sold in total premiums were billion in compared to billion in the increase was due to increases in immediate annuities with life contingencies  partially offset by declines in traditional life  accident  health and other insurance products 
the decline in traditional life premiums was primarily related to the implementation of a reinsurance agreement on january  that ceded our direct response credit life insurance products and  to a lesser extent  a shift in product sales from traditional whole life insurance to term 
contract charges increased to million in compared to million in contract charges were consistent with the prior year as higher interest sensitive life contract charges resulting from in force business growth were partially offset by lower variable annuity contract charges  which resulted from lower average variable annuity account balances during the period 
variable annuity contract charges  as a percent of average separate account values  increased to basis points in from basis points in as a result of increases in benefit rider fee rates and utilization by contractholders 
contract charges increased in compared to as contract charges on new sales of interest sensitive life products more than offset a decline from variable annuities 
variable annuity contract charges declined due to lower average account values during as poor equity market performance more than offset growth from deposits during the year 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of individual products  such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  net bank deposits and institutional products  such as funding agreements 
the balance of contractholder funds is equal to the cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract maturities  benefits  surrenders  withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses

fixed annuity deposits increased over due to competitive pricing and our decision to maintain a market presence despite a challenging interest rate environment 
fixed annuity deposits through our financial institutions distribution channel grew in compared to this growth was a result of expanded relationships and consumers attraction to fixed rate contracts with shorter term rate guarantees due to volatile equity markets and the uncertainty of a low interest rate environment 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in fixed annuities sold through our independent agencies distribution channel where longer term interest rate guarantees are generally favored 
as a result of the low interest rate environment during  we introduced fixed annuity contracts with lower guaranteed crediting rates 
institutional products deposits increased largely due to our assessment of market opportunities 
benefits and withdrawals increased million in compared to benefits and withdrawals for represent of the beginning of period contractholder funds balance  a slight increase compared to in the increase reflects the aging of our in force contracts as the actual surrenders and withdrawals compared favorably to our expectations 
institutional product maturities increased billion in as an increasing number of contracts issued in prior years reached their stated maturity dates 
billion is scheduled to mature in contractholder funds deposits increased in compared to due to significant increases in fixed annuity deposits and bank and other deposits  partially offset by a decline in institutional products 
fixed annuity deposits increased over due to competitive pricing and the introduction of the allstate treasury linked annuity  which generated million of deposits in institutional deposits decreased in  as market conditions at times during the year would not allow us to achieve acceptable pricing returns 
average contractholder funds increased in compared to separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related legally segregated separate accounts assets 
separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies 
the following table shows the changes in separate accounts liabilities

the increase in variable annuity net deposits resulted from the increasing attractiveness of the separate accounts equity investment funds following improved equity market performance and the introduction of the allstate advisor variable annuity product 
allstate advisor is a multi manager variable annuity that offers funds from four mutual fund families 
in volatile and uncertain equity markets  variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option 
this allows contractholders to transfer funds to separate accounts equity investment funds over time and to purchase their equity investment fund shares at multiple fund price levels 
this is commonly referred to as dollar cost averaging 
the level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to the fixed accounts  while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts 
the liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds 
separate accounts liabilities decreased billion during compared to  reflecting the significant decline in equity markets and the resulting substantial decrease in variable annuity net deposits during the year 
net investment income increased in compared to and in compared to the increases were due to higher portfolio balances during the year as investment income on positive cash flows from product sales and deposits was mostly offset by lower portfolio yields 
investment balances as of december   excluding unrealized net capital gains  increased from december  and increased as of december  compared to december  the lower portfolio yields were primarily due to purchases of fixed income securities with yields lower than the current portfolio average 
during we reclassified periodic settlements and accruals on derivative instruments used for economic hedging purposes but categorized as non hedge for accounting purposes  to realized capital gains and losses so that they are reported consistently with the corresponding fair value adjustments on these instruments

investment margin increased in compared to due to a increase in contractholder funds and actions to reduce crediting rates where possible  partially offset by the decline in the portfolio yield of fixed income securities 
for fixed annuities and life products for which we have the ability to modify crediting rates  the weighted average interest crediting rate was approximately and basis points above the long term underlying guaranteed rate at december  and december   respectively 
the yield decline on the assets that support our capital  traditional life or other products for which the company does not have the ability to modify crediting rates also had a significant negative impact on the investment margin during the year 
the investment margin increased in compared to the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in contractholder funds 
the impact of this growth was partially offset by a decline in portfolio yields from lower market interest rates affecting the yield on the investment of cash flows from operations and investments  and a shift to sales of investment products with lower investment margins  such as market value adjusted annuities mvaa and funding agreements that have lower capital requirements and cash flow variability

the remainder was due to a larger number of life claims in the first quarter of  poor mortality results on certain closed blocks of business and the effect of the discontinuance of direct response non life credit insurance  partially offset by higher mortality margin from growth of interest sensitive life and accident and health products sold through the workplace 
in  gmdb payments were million  net of reinsurance  hedging results and other contractual arrangements net gmdb payments  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
while net gmdb payments were higher than in  improved equity market performance during resulted in sequential quarterly reductions in gross gmdb payments 
direct response non life credit insurance generated a mortality margin of million and million in and  respectively 
the mortality margin was comparable in and as increased contract charges from interest sensitive life growth were offset by increased policy benefits and net gmdb payments 
amortization of dac increased during compared to the increase was primarily due to in force business growth  partially offset by decreased amortization from lower gross margins on variable annuities and certain fixed annuities 
amortization of dac increased in compared to  primarily due to higher dac unlocking and growth of business in force 
net dac unlocking totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of dac assumptions in the first quarter of and concluded that  due to sustained poor performance of the equity markets coupled with an expectation of moderate future performance due to continuing weakness in the us economy and uncertainty in the geopolitical environment  it was no longer reasonably possible that variable annuity fund returns would revert to the expected long term mean within the time horizon used in our reversion to the mean model 
as a result  we unlocked the dac assumptions for all investment products  including variable and fixed annuities  and interest sensitive life products  to be consistent across all product lines 
the unlocking of dac assumptions included million for variable annuities  partially offset by the effect of favorable investment margins on fixed annuities and favorable persistency on interest sensitive life products 
the most significant assumption change involved resetting the variable annuity reversion to the mean calculation  such that future equity market performance during the five year reversion period was reduced from after fees to the long term assumed return of after fees 
the changes in the dac asset are summarized in the following tables 
in millions beginning balance december  acquisition costs deferred amortization charged to income amortization acceleration deceleration charged to income effect of unrealized capital gains and losses ending balance december  traditional life interest sensitive life   variable annuities investment contracts accident  health and other total   beginning balance december  acquisition costs deferred amortization charged to income amortization acceleration deceleration charged to income effect of unrealized capital gains and losses ending balance december  traditional life interest sensitive life   variable annuities investment contracts accident  health and other total   included as a component of amortization of dac on the consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that as a result of the dac unlocking performed in  the variable annuity dac asset is appropriately valued for the current economic environment 
with moderate movements in the equity markets  the likelihood of future dac unlocking is substantially reduced since the projected return in the mean reversion period is no longer at the maximum 
operating costs and expenses increased in compared to the following table summarizes operating costs and expenses

developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them to be considered a higher risk 
there has also been recent consolidation activity between reinsurers in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
additionally  one of our primary reinsurers has announced its intention to no longer assume life reinsurance risks 
as a result  we plan to increase our retention of term life insurance and evaluate alternative reinsurance structures

no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook our ability to grow our investment margin is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates  and growing the amount of business in force 
as interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels  we expect a reduction in our investment yields 
the amount in which these lower yields will reduce our investment margin is contingent on our ability to lower interest crediting rates on certain interest sensitive products  which could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees  and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
also  a significant amount of our invested assets are used to support our capital and non interest sensitive products  which do not provide this offsetting opportunity 
as a result  we expect growth in our investment margin from net new business  which also fluctuates in relation to the interest rate environment  to be partially offset by compression in our in force investment spreads 
if equity markets perform at historical norms  we expect to see positive growth in our variable annuity gross margins from increased revenue and lower net gmdb payments on our in force business 
however  improvements or deteriorations in our variable annuity gross margins from changes in equity markets performance creates a proportional increase or decrease in variable annuity amortization of dac  which will offset a significant portion of the changes in gross margins 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
to eliminate some of these market concerns  we are expecting to retain more of our mortality risk in this change will have a diminutive effect on our net income in the short term  but will provide the foundation to drive increased long term growth in our life insurance business 
our mortality margins will also be more volatile in the future as we retain and manage more of our mortality risk  which will require increased statutory capital 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolio 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
overview and strategy the investment strategy for the property liability portfolio emphasizes safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
the method for achieving this goal is based on a strategic asset allocation model  which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerance as well as the risk return parameters of various asset classes 
this modeling  along with duration and liquidity considerations  is the guide for our asset allocation 
on a tactical basis  decisions are made based on analysis of relative value opportunities across markets 
performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights 
reviews of the portfolio are conducted regularly  including a portfolio monitoring process that identifies securities that are impaired on an other than temporary basis 
for more information see the portfolio monitoring section of the md a 
this approach to balancing total return management with income needs and risk tolerances has produced competitive returns over time 
the investment strategy for allstate financial is also based upon a strategic asset allocation framework that takes into account the need to manage the portfolio on a risk adjusted spread basis for the underlying contract liabilities and to maximize return on retained capital 
generally  a combination of recognized market  analytical and proprietary modeling is used to achieve a desired asset mix in the management of the portfolio 
the strategic asset allocation model portfolio is the primary basis for setting annual asset allocation targets with respect to interest sensitive  illiquid and credit asset allocations as well as limitations with respect to overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
on a tactical basis  decisions are made on an option adjusted relative value basis staying within the constraints of the strategic asset allocation framework 
we believe asset spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform on a long term basis and by using trading to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
total return measurement is used on a selective basis where the asset risks are significant eg  high yield fixed income securities  convertible bonds 
we expect that by employing this strategy we will minimize interest rate market impacts on investment income and provide sustainable investment income over time

allstate financial investments increased to billion at december   from billion at december  the increase in allstate financial investments was primarily due to positive cash flows from operating and financing activities and increased funds associated with dollar roll programs 
corporate and other investments increased to billion at december   from billion at december  the increase was primarily due to the consolidation of two variable interest entities vies used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under fin for further disclosure of this consolidation  see the capital resources and liquidity section of the md a 
total investment balances related to collateral  primarily due to securities lending  increased to billion at december   from billion at december  we use different methodologies to estimate the fair value of publicly and non publicly traded marketable investment securities and exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative contracts 
for a discussion of these methods  see the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a

the municipal bond portfolio at december  consisted of approximately  issues from approximately  issuers 
the largest exposure to a single issuer was less than of the municipal bond portfolio 
the ultimate obligors of approximately of the municipal bond portfolio were corporate entities 
corporate bonds totaled billion and were rated as investment grade at december  as of december   the fixed income securities portfolio contained billion of privately placed corporate obligations or of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio  compared with billion at december  the benefits of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields  improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds on many bonds  and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration  reinvestment risk and fluctuations in interest rates 
a disadvantage of privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity 
at december   of the privately placed securities were rated as investment grade 
foreign government securities totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  mortgage backed securities mbs totaled billion at december  in our mbs portfolio  the credit risk associated with mbs is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists primarily of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by  us government agencies or us government sponsored entities 
the mbs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying mortgages 
we attempt to limit interest rate risk on these securities by investing a portion of the portfolio in securities that provide prepayment protection 
at december   approximately of the mbs portfolio was invested in planned amortization class bonds or the equivalent 
though these security types offer greater relative prepayment protection than other mbs securities  the degree of protection has been limited in this interest rate environment 
based on market conditions and potential changes in portfolio management objectives  the value of this protection and the significance of these holdings relative to the entire portfolio may be reduced in future periods 
asset backed securities abs totaled billion at december  our abs portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is mitigated by monitoring the performance of the collateral 
approximately of the abs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s s p rating of aaa  the highest rating category 
the abs portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of repayment of the underlying assets 
approximately of the abs portfolio is invested in securitized credit card receivables 
the remainder of the portfolio is primarily backed by securitized home equity  manufactured housing or auto loans 
at december   of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade  which is defined as a security having a rating from the national association of insurance commissioners naic of or  a moody s equivalent rating of aaa  aa  a or baa  an s p equivalent rating of aaa  aa  a or bbb  or a comparable internal rating

gross unrealized gains totaled billion at december  compared to million at december  gross unrealized losses totaled million at december  compared to million at december  unrealized gains and losses see note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding unrealized losses on fixed income and equity securities and factors considered in determining that they are not other than temporarily impaired 
the unrealized net capital gains on fixed income and equity securities at december  were billion  an increase of million or since december  gross unrealized losses were primarily concentrated in the corporate fixed income portfolios and were comprised of securities in the following sectors 
gross unrealized at december  amortized cost fair value gains losses in millions corporate consumer goods cyclical and non cyclical  public utilities   banking   capital goods   communications   basic industry   financial services   energy   transportation   other   technology total corporate fixed income portfolio   us government and agencies municipal    foreign government   mortgage backed securities   asset backed securities   redeemable preferred stock total fixed income securities    the banking  consumer goods and transportation sectors had the highest concentration of unrealized losses in our corporate fixed income securities portfolio at december  the gross unrealized losses in these sectors are primarily company specific or interest rate related 
while we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors  we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at december  the equity portfolio is comprised of securities in the following sectors 
gross unrealized at december  fair value cost gains losses in millions consumer goods cyclical and non cyclical  technology financial services real estate capital goods banking communications energy basic industry utilities transportation other total equities    during  we have experienced an increase in gross unrealized gains and a decrease in gross unrealized losses as a result of a recovering equity market 
the consumer goods sector has the highest concentration of gross unrealized losses in our equity portfolio at december   which were primarily company specific 
while we expect eventual recovery of these securities and this sector  we included every security in our portfolio monitoring process at december  the following table shows the composition by credit quality of the fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses at december  naic rating moody s  s p or equivalent unrealized loss percent to total fair value percent to total in millions aaa aa a  baa  ba b caa or lower in or near default total  the table above includes redeemable preferred securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million 
it also includes securities that have not yet received an naic rating  for which we have assigned a rating based on an analysis similar to that used by the naic  with a fair value totaling million and an unrealized loss of million 
due to lags between the funding of an investment  processing of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office of the naic svo  and rating by the svo  we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating 
at december   million  or  of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
as of december   million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities 
of this amount  was in a significant unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities that are rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were purchased at investment grade  but have since been downgraded 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities and through diversification of the portfolio 
the scheduled maturity dates for fixed income securities in an unrealized loss position at december  is shown below 
actual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of repayments by the issuers 
in millions unrealized loss percent to total fair value percent to total due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years  due after ten years  mortgage and asset backed securities  total  because of the potential for prepayment  mortgage and asset backed securities are not categorized based on their contractual maturities 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
the watch list is reviewed in detail to determine whether any other than temporary impairment exists 
the unrealized loss balance for fixed income and equity securities can be further segmented into the following four categories of securities  with the unrealized net loss in each category at december  listed in parenthesis i securities with an unrealized loss less than of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities million of unrealized loss  ii securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of less than six consecutive months prior to december  million of unrealized loss  iii securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for a period of six or more consecutive months  but less than consecutive months prior to december  million of unrealized loss  and iv securities with an unrealized loss greater than or equal to of cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities for twelve or more consecutive months prior to december  million of unrealized loss 
categories i and ii have generally been adversely affected by the downturn in the financial markets  overall economic conditions  and the market s evaluation of certain sectors 
while all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment  the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
in general  we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time 
for category iii there were equity securities with a fair value of million and fixed income securities with a fair value of million and million of unrealized loss  with the largest unrealized loss being million 
of the fixed income securities in this category  securities with a fair value of million and an unrealized loss of million were rated as being below investment grade at december  for category iv there were fixed income securities with a fair value of million and million of unrealized loss  with the largest unrealized loss being million 
all of these securities were rated as being below investment grade at december  whenever we decide that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  we use a process of additional evaluations and management approvals to determine why a write down is not required 
the following table contains the individual securities as of december   with the largest unrealized losses 
no other fixed income or equity security had an unrealized loss greater than of the total unrealized loss on fixed income and equity securities in millions unrealized loss fair value naic rating unrealized loss category state general obligation for a pension fund i shipping offshore engineering iii foreign dairy conglomerate ii food processing company n a ii chemical plastics production distribution iii asset backed security for aircraft leases iv total we also monitor the quality of our fixed income portfolio by categorizing certain investments as problem  restructured or potential problem 
problem fixed income securities are securities in default with respect to principal or interest and or securities issued by companies that have gone into bankruptcy subsequent to our acquisition of the security 
restructured fixed income securities have rates and terms that are not consistent with market rates or terms prevailing at the time of the restructuring 
potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have serious concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest  which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at december percent of total fixed income portfolio in millions amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio problem restructured potential problem total net carrying value cumulative write downs recognized we have experienced a decrease in our balance of fixed income securities categorized as potential problem as of december  compared to december  the decrease was related primarily to the sale of holdings in this category due to specific developments causing a change in our outlook and intent to hold those securities 
we also evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at december  and recorded write downs when appropriate 
we further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature 
while these balances may increase in the future  particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable  management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio 
net realized capital gains and losses the following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended december in millions investment write downs sales valuation of derivative instruments settlement of derivative instruments realized capital gains and losses  pretax income tax expense benefit realized capital gains and losses  after tax investment write downs during represented approximately of the average total investment portfolio value during the year 
for the year ended december   the million in net gains from sales was comprised of gross gains of million and gross losses of million 
gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities were million which  combined with investment write downs on fixed income and equity securities of million  represents total gross realized losses of million 
of the million in gross losses from sales of fixed income and equity securities  million resulted from sales of fixed income securities and million resulted from sales of equity securities 
in  losses from sales were primarily related to routine reductions of exposures to deteriorating credits  reallocation of funds to other investments in a higher interest rate environment and equity portfolio turnover resulting from relative value opportunities 
we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
recognizing in certain situations new factors such as negative developments  subsequent credit deterioration  relative value opportunities  market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security 
the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million with the largest being million and the smallest being million 
of those losses  four related to securities that were in our unrealized loss categories iii or iv 
our largest aggregate loss on sales and writedowns by issuer and its affiliates are shown in the following table 
no other issuer and its affiliates had an aggregated loss on sales and writedowns greater than of the total gross loss on sales and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities 
we have also included in this table the related circumstances giving rise to the losses and a discussion of how those circumstances may have affected other material investments held

the circumstances of this impairment are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
total holdings could include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost 
mortgage loans our billion mortgage loans portfolio at december  and billion at december   was comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate and was primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio 
geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk  are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return 
we had net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of one year or less 
we also participate in securities lending  primarily as an investment yield enhancement  with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral in an amount equal to and of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is subsequently invested and included in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities 
at december   the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of million 
this compares to billion at december  market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview we generate substantial investable funds from our property liability and allstate financial businesses 
in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment guidelines define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and control over these risk management activities 
in addition  the subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow guidelines that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and that specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given their liquidity  surplus  product  and regulatory requirements 
executive oversight of investment risk management processes is conducted primarily through the boards of directors and investment committees of the subsidiaries conducting investment activities 
administration and detailed managerial oversight of investment risk  including market risk  is provided through our credit and risk management committee crmc 
we also have an enterprise wide committee called the enterprise risk council erc that is responsible for assessing risks  including market and other investment risks  on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and organizations 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation limits  duration limits and value at risk limits  through the use of simulation and  as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets over a time interval based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by the investment guidelines 
although we apply a common overall governance approach to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur an economic loss due to adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and carry significant interest sensitive liabilities  primarily in our allstate financial operations 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset with a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap results from the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
in order to achieve this objective and limit exposure to interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities 
this philosophy includes using interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from unintended duration mismatches between assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk related to anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floor agreements  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements  and when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   counterparties have posted collateral to us totaling million 
to calculate duration  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately billion  compared to million at december  additionally  there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments and as a result have not been included in the above estimate 
this amount has increased from the billion reported at december  due to increases in policies in force 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  these assets would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains and losses totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in a particular stock  mutual fund  or stock index 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership funds and non redeemable preferred securities  compared to approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other equity investments at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  at december   our portfolio of equity instruments had a beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  in mathematical terms  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to the standard poor s composite price index s p 
based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p decreases by  the fair value of our equity portfolio will decrease by approximately 
likewise  we estimate that if the s p increases by  the fair value of our equity portfolio will increase by approximately 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity portfolio identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our equity portfolio was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity portfolio to monthly total returns of the s p over a three year historical period 
since beta is historically based  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future 
therefore  the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
we earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values 
in the event of an immediate decline of in the account values due to equity market declines  we would have earned approximately million and million less in fee income at december  and december   respectively 
variable annuity contracts sold by allstate financial usually have a gmdb and customers may choose to purchase an enhanced gmdb  guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib prior to and beginning in a truereturn sm accumulation benefit gmab on certain contracts 
these guarantees subject us to additional equity risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than the current account value 
gmdbs are payable upon death  while gmibs are payable on or after the ten year anniversary of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments annuitize 
gmabs are payable on a date that is pre determined by the contractholder  between the eighth and twentieth year of the contract 
gmabs guarantee a return of up to times or of the amount deposited in the contract  depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocations 
at december  and  the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be billion and billion  respectively  net of reinsurance 
the decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during in both periods  approximately two thirds of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee  while the remaining one third is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits 
in addition to reinsurance for these benefits  we entered into various derivative instruments during that were intended to offset a portion of expected death benefit payments and the risk of future death claims on all new business issued on january  and later  and any payments of gmabs 
we estimate the present value of expected future payments for gmdbs for the next quarters to be approximately million at december  compared to million at december  in order to calculate this estimate  we considered the current guarantees outstanding for all contracts that contain gmdbs  the expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for dac amortization 
the decrease in this estimate at december  is primarily attributable to the equity market improvement during the year 
we also estimate the effect on expected future gmdb payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions 
in the event of an immediate decline in account values of due to equity market declines  payments for guaranteed death benefits at december  would increase by an estimated million during the next year 
the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
also  our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model 
included among the gmib contracts we have sold are contracts that provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period 
the guaranteed benefit feature was first offered in certain of our gmib products beginning in  with guaranteed benefits available for election by the contractholders beginning in we estimate the present value of expected future payments for gmibs for the next years to be approximately million at december  compared to million at december  in calculating this estimate we considered the current mix of guarantees outstanding  expected fund performance and the assumptions and methodology we use for dac amortization 
the decrease in is primarily due to improved equity markets in  partially offset by the fact that contractholders are one year closer to being eligible to annuitize 
we also estimate the effect on our expected future gmib payments in the event of extreme adverse market conditions 
in the event of an immediate decline of in contractholders account values as of december  due to equity market declines  there would be no immediate effect on our earnings or cash flow  since these benefits are not payable until at least the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
as of december  we do not have a reserve established for the gmdbs or gmibs  however  this will change with the adoption of statement of position in see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this pending accounting change 
additional sales of variable annuity contracts will increase our equity risk because of these benefits 
an increase in the equity markets above the december  level will increase account values for these contracts  thereby decreasing the risk of the gmdbs  gmibs and gmabs being utilized in the future 
likewise  a decrease in the equity markets that causes a decrease in the account values will increase our equity risk because of these benefits 
in addition to our gmdb and gmib equity risk  at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with guaranteed crediting rates based on the price of the s p we hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures  swap futures  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
allstate financial also is exposed to equity risk in dac 
fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect dac amortization  because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the egp for variable life and annuity contracts 
for a more detailed discussion of dac  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments and our canadian operations 
we also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  but we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional million net investment in our canadian subsidiaries 
these amounts were million and million  respectively  at december  the foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across countries  slightly reduced from countries at december  our largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions 
net periodic pension cost increased in and principally due to unfavorable returns on plan assets  and decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on market trends and a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from benefit payments made to agents 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as payments continue to be made to agents in connection with the reorganization of allstate s multiple agency programs to a single exclusive agency program during as provided for in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in and primarily due to the decline in the equity markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in increased amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the projected benefit obligations or of the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by standard poor s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october   our most recent measurement date  versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by million as of october   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at october   compared to an increase of million at october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at october   compared to a decrease of million at october  changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our capital resources at december in millions common stock  retained earnings and other shareholders equity items accumulated other comprehensive income    total shareholders equity    mandatorily redeemable preferred securities debt    total capital resources    ratio of debt and mandatorily redeemable preferred securities to shareholders equity shareholders equity increased in when compared to  as net income  unrealized net capital gains on investments and a decrease in the minimum pension liability were partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases 
shareholders equity increased in when compared to  due to higher net income and unrealized capital gains that were partially offset by an increase in the minimum pension liability  dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases 
in february  we announced a billion increase in the current share repurchase program 
as of the date of this announcement  the current share repurchase program had billion remaining  and is expected to be completed by december  treasury stock is a component of shareholders equity  and since  we have repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of billion  primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs 
we have reissued million shares since  primarily associated with our equity incentive plans  the acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation ahl and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities were eliminated as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of financial position effective july   because of the adoption of fin this accounting guidance required the de consolidation of allstate financing ii af ii  a subsidiary that we own  and the recognition of debt that we had previously issued to af ii  the proceeds of which are held as collateral for the mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
for further discussion of the capital structure of af ii  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
debt increased in compared to due to the adoption of fin and increases in long term borrowings outstanding  partly offset by declines in short term borrowings outstanding 
the adoption of fin  effective july   increased long term debt by billion  including million for the consolidation of two vies to hold assets under the management of an affiliate on behalf of third party investors  million for the consolidation of a vie for a headquarters office building and up to automotive collision repair stores  million for the consolidation of the debt of a previously unconsolidated investment security  and million of the debt we issued to af ii that is no longer required to be consolidated 
although we are required to consolidate the two vies used to hold assets on behalf of third party investors under fin  we have no legal ownership of the assets and no obligation to repay the debt 
our maximum exposure related to these two entities is the current value of our equity investment  which totaled million at december  moody s and standard and poor s have apprised us that the reported debt associated with the consolidation of these vies will be excluded for analytical purposes from the ratio of debt to shareholders equity for ratings considerations 
this analytical ratio was as of december  for more information on the adoption of fin  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due in  utilizing the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission sec in june the proceeds of this issuance were used to redeem the million of notes due and for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings 
the increase in debt in compared to the level was primarily due to the issuance of million of senior notes due in  and the issuance of million of senior notes due in the proceeds of the million issuance were used for general corporate purposes  and the proceeds of the million issuance were used to redeem million of senior quarterly interest bonds 
both of the senior note issuances in were issued under an existing shelf registration statement filed with the sec in june financial ratings and strength the following table summarizes our debt  commercial paper and insurance financial strength ratings at december  moody s standard poor s am best the allstate corporation senior long term debt a a a the allstate corporation commercial paper p a amb allstate insurance company financial strength aa aa a allstate life insurance company alic financial strength aa aa a american heritage life insurance company financial strength aa aa a our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance  asset quality  liquidity  asset liability management  overall portfolio mix  financial leverage ie  debt  exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage 
in february  am best revised the outlook to stable from positive for the insurance financial strength ratings of alic and certain rated subsidiaries and affiliates 
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus is a common measure of operating leverage used in the property casualty insurance industry and serves as an indicator of a company s premium growth capacity 
ratios in excess of to are typically considered outside the usual range by insurance regulators and rating agencies 
aic s premium to surplus ratio was x on december  compared to x in the prior year 
state laws specify regulatory actions if an insurer s risk based capital rbc  a measure of an insurer s solvency  falls below certain levels 
the naic has a standard formula for assessing rbc 
the formula for calculating rbc for property liability companies takes into account asset and credit risks but places more emphasis on underwriting factors for reserving and pricing 
the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges 
liquidity sources and uses our potential sources of funds principally include activities shown in the following table 
property liability allstate financial corporate and other receipt of insurance premiums x x allstate financial contractholder fund deposits x reinsurance recoveries x x receipts of principal  interest and dividends on investments x x x sales of investments x x x funds from investment repurchase agreements  securities lending  dollar roll  commercial paper and lines of credit agreements x x x inter company loans and tax refunds settlements x x x capital contributions from parent x x dividends from subsidiaries x x x funds from periodic issuance of additional securities x funds from the settlement of our benefit plans x our potential uses of funds principally include activities shown in the following table

property liability allstate financial corporate and other consolidated in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities     investing activities     financing activities     net increase in consolidated cash property liability higher operating cash flows of the property liability business in and were primarily due to increased underwriting income 
in  operating cash flows were also impacted by contributions made to our defined benefit pension plans 
cash used in investing activities increased in and as higher operating cash flows were invested in the fixed income and equity portfolios 
cash flows of the property liability business are also impacted by dividends paid by aic to its parent  the allstate corporation 
these dividends totaled billion  million and billion in  and  respectively 
for a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
allstate financial higher operating cash flows of allstate financial in and primarily relates to increases in investment income  partially offset by an increase in benefits and acquisition related expenses from new business growth 
cash flows used in investing activities declined in compared to as the investment of higher operating cash flows were offset by lower financing cash flow 
lower cash flow from financing activities during reflects an increase in maturities of institutional products and benefits and withdrawals from contractholders accounts  partially offset by increased deposits received from contractholders 
higher cash provided by financing activities in reflects increased deposits received from contractholders 
for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
a portion of the allstate financial product portfolio  primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products  is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders 
the following table summarizes allstate financial s liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  approximately of these liabilities is subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment 
in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal  subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges  market value  subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments  total contractholder funds  includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
to ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment  we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios 
corporate and other higher uses of cash in the investing activities of our corporate and other segment during reflect additional net investments made in the portfolio of the subsidiary  kennett capital 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  when we increase or decrease the level of these activities  financing cash flows are affected 
long term debt and invested assets increased during related to the adoption of fin however since these increases did not impact our cash flows and were non cash entries  they had no impact to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program  lines of credit  dollar rolls and repurchase agreements 
in the aggregate  at december  these sources could provide over billion of additional liquidity 
for additional liquidity  we can issue new insurance contracts  incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio 
the liquidity of the investment portfolio varies by type of investment 
for example  billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent of the investment portfolio  and billion of mortgage loans that represent of the investment portfolio  generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments  such as our us government and agencies  municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios 
we have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding  however  the outstanding balance fluctuates daily 
two primary credit facilities and one additional credit facility totaling billion to cover short term liquidity requirements 
these consist of a million five year revolving line of credit expiring in  a million day revolving line of credit expiring in the second quarter of and a million one year revolving line of credit expiring in the third quarter of the right to borrow under the five year and day facilities is subject to requirements that are customary for facilities of this size  type and purpose 
these requirements are currently being met and we expect to continue to meet them in the future 
there were no borrowings under any of these lines of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the three credit facilities is limited to billion 
the right to issue up to an additional billion of debt securities  equity securities  warrants for debt and equity securities  trust preferred securities  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a and a from moody s and standard poor s  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below aa aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  and therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years securities lending  dollar rolls  and repurchase agreements  guaranteed investment contracts gics funding agreements non putable funding agreements putable callable   payout annuities structured settlements   long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations pension obligations  total contractual cash obligations     securities lending  dollar rolls and repurchase transactions are typically fully collateralized with marketable securities 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business 
the putable callable funding agreement program as well as the non putable funding agreement and gic programs are very closely asset liability duration matched by alic 
accordingly  alic maintains assets with a sufficient market value to extinguish the liabilities in the normal course of business upon expected surrender or maturity of the related contracts 
alic closely manages the assets supporting payout annuities structured settlement liabilities 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
pension obligations represent approved contributions to our pension plans 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional total commitments represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required 
regulation and legal proceedings regulation we are subject to changing social  economic and regulatory conditions 
recent state and federal regulatory initiatives and proceedings have included efforts to influence and restrict premium rates in a manner adverse to insurers  restrict the ability of insurers to cancel policies  limit insurers ability to impose underwriting standards and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry 
the ultimate changes and eventual effects of these initiatives on our business  if any  are uncertain 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions that have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
like other members of the insurance industry  we are the target of an increasing number of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation  some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts 
for a detailed description of these actions  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards as of december   there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
these standards include statement of position  fasb staff position no 
fas and emerging issues task force topic number for a discussion of these pending and proposed standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
based on our interpretation and application of statement of position  we estimate that upon adoption on january   it will impact our consolidated statements of operations in the range of million to million 
however  the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them 
forward looking statements and risk factors this document contains forward looking statements that anticipate results based on our estimates  assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty 
these statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments 
these forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like plans  seeks  expects  will  should  anticipates  estimates  intends  believes  likely  targets and other words with similar meanings 
these statements may address  among other things  our strategy for growth  product development  regulatory approvals  market position  expenses  financial results  litigation and reserves 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document including the risks described below and in our public filings with the sec 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including tornadoes  hurricanes  earthquakes  tropical storms  wildfires and terrorism 
while we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses  we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane andrew in  totaling billion  and to the northridge earthquake of  totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the california earthquake authority and various florida state created catastrophe loss management facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as snowstorms  ice storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our property liability business 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of changes in the rate of inflation in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law  and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas 
although we are currently pursuing various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment that seek to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
recently  our allstate protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency 
we believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors  including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders  a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses  and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria 
the recent favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and incurred but not reported  after considering known facts and circumstances  internal factors including our experience with similar losses  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  loss payments  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs and product mix 
in addition  reserve estimates are influenced by external factors including changes in regulation  court decisions  economic conditions and public attitudes 
because reserves are estimates of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be  covered  the ability of policyholders to file claims or add claimants to active claims  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves  these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
consequently  ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries  and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial position 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
moreover  because allstate protection s loss ratio currently compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases 
such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge an adequate price or mandating subsidized rates 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at an inadequate or subsidized price  leading to an unacceptable return on capital 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
the potential benefits of implementing srm may not be fully realized we believe that the tier based pricing and underwriting approach including the use of credit history as an underwriting criterion used in srm has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  our competitors may adopt underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models similar to those used in srm 
further  the use of credit history as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify srm 
furthermore  because we have been using srm only for the last several years  we cannot make assurances that srm underwriting criteria and tier based pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated through the use of srm 
moreover  to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers  our expectation that the amount of business written using srm will increase may not be realized 
allstate protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
in and  prices in allstate protection s principal lines increased more quickly than in prior years  and underwriting standards became more stringent 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review and revise our reserve estimates and if future experience differs from assumptions  adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial investment margin for spread based products is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates on business 
as interest rates decrease or remain at historically low levels  assets may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment margin 
for example  during the average pre tax investment yield for the allstate financial portfolio declined to from in lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory minimum rates or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
unanticipated surrenders could result in dac unlocking or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition conditions in the united states and international stock markets affect allstate financial s sales of variable annuities 
recent allegations of improper or illegal trading activities at large mutual fund complexes could affect the stock markets 
in general  sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time 
the effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets  lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease 
in addition  it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for gmdb  gmib and gmab products  particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance  do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits  resulting in adverse margin trends 
these factors may result in accelerated dac amortization and require increases in reserves  which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or allstate financial s net income 
poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which  for some contracts  do not reduce the gmdb by a proportional amount 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  variable annuity and investment contracts is amortized in proportion to egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
assumptions underlying egp  including those relating to margins from mortality  investment margin  contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of dac 
updates to these assumptions could result in dac unlocking  which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
this risk may be heightened by the enactment of the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act  which eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurers and other financial service providers 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products under current federal and state income tax law  certain products primarily life insurance and annuities we offer receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
one such proposal was enacted in may when president bush signed the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which reduced the federal income tax rates applicable to certain dividends and capital gains realized by individuals 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage of certain of our products as compared to competing products 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  recent changes in the federal estate tax laws have negatively affected the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar insurance products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in addition  we may face increased competition from banks 
until passage of the glb act  the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses was limited and banks were restricted from being affiliated with insurers 
with the passage of the glb act  mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company are now permitted 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
changing interest rates and declines in credit quality may have adverse effects a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities we hold more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio  for example  by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks 
a declining market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation  resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans 
we may suffer losses from litigation as is typical for a large insurance group  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation 
among other things  we  like other participants in the insurance industry  have been subject in recent years to an increasing volume of class action litigation challenging a range of industry practices 
our litigation exposure could result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition in a future period in the event of an unexpected adverse outcome or if additional reserves are required to be established for such litigation 
for a description of our current material litigation matters  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth we are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance regulators 
this regulation is focused on the protection of policyholders and not investors 
in many cases  state regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
additionally  we have various entities registered under the federal securities laws as broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies 
these entities are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the sec  the national association of securities dealers and  in some cases  state securities administrators 
the laws regulating the securities products and activities of allstate financial are complex  numerous and subject to change 
further  in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny  and proposals that would provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies have been discussed by members of congress 
we can make no assurances as to whether further state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance industry or as to the effect that any such measures would have on us 
the unavailability of reinsurance may limit our ability to write new business market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our net liability exposure or reduce our insurance writings 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim expense we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and declines in the equity markets in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
in the event that a terrorist act occurs  both allstate protection and allstate financial may be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally will have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a decline in the value of an insurer s investment portfolio or increased liabilities for variable contracts arising from additional gmdb  gmib or gmab exposure resulting from market declines 
currently  the insurance financial strength ratings of both aic and alic are aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively 
because these ratings are subject to periodic review  the continued retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  including the competitiveness and marketability of our product offerings  as well as our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
for a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our debt service obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders and service our debt
