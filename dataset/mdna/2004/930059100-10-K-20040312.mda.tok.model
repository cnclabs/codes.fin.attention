the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview during  financial markets improved significantly from recent years  which had a positive impact on all aspects of our business 
the greatest benefit was on investment management fee revenue as average assets under management appreciated 
the market improvement also positively impacted mutual fund sales by our waddell reed advisor channel 
our institutional separate account business continued to increase through the year due to our strong investment performance track record over the long term 
was also a year in which we made progress implementing many new initiatives to foster future growth 
great effort went into improving future waddell reed advisors productivity through technology  namely our new core customer relationship management system 
we also accomplished much regarding our strategy to build non proprietary distribution  net sales turned positive and assets under management reached a critical mass 
over the last three years  waddell reed has continued to invest in its business 
should be a year of concentrating on the tactical aspects of these strategic investments 
the improved financial market conditions are a welcomed environment from which to grow 
the company s earnings and cash flows are heavily dependent on financial market conditions 
significant increases or decreases in the various securities markets  particularly equity markets  can have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we derive our revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution  and administrative services to the funds and institutional and separately managed accounts 
investment management fees  our most substantial source of revenues  are based on the amount of average assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions  and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues  another substantial source of revenues  consist of sales charges and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products  distribution fees on certain variable products and asset based fees earned on our spa product  as well as advisory services 
the products sold have various sales charge structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b distribution fees earned for distributing certain mutual fund shares are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions  and financial market conditions 
service fees include transfer agency fees  custodian fees for retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting 
during  we placed emphasis on improving advisor productivity  rather than on recruiting financial advisors  including raising minimum production requirements  causing advisors to either become more productive or leave the business 
as a result  advisor headcount in decreased by 
however  productivity improved for four consecutive quarters 
beginning in the second quarter of  we expect to see increases in advisor headcount as we re emphasize recruiting 
our objective is annual growth in advisor headcount over the long term 
strategic alliance with securian financial group our april  strategic alliance agreement with securian provided us with premier strategic partner status in securian s distribution system  including the securian financial network approximately  general agency registered representatives  securian financial services broker dealer  and securian retirement services k

immediately following the purchase  mimi was able to dividend to us million  therefore the acquisition cost was million net of the dividend 
we recorded goodwill of million and indefinite life intangible assets of million in connection with this transaction 
as part of the transaction  we entered into new subadvisory and marketing agreements 
those agreements extended mfc s subadvisory agreements with wriico and provided us with additional investment management opportunities in canada 
pursuant to the subadvisory agreements  we receive investment management fees covering multiple of mfc s funds whose assets were approximately  usd million and million usd at december  and  respectively 
pursuant to the marketing agreement  mfc provides us with opportunities to launch new funds and or assume additional existing subadvisory mandates under the universal brand name in canada  and facilitates our relationship with mfc s parent company  investors group inc and its affiliates

of the total number of shares of restricted stock issued  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of approximately million from the participants at their direction to pay individual income tax liabilities 
as a result   net shares of restricted stock were issued 
we recorded a charge of million million after tax to equity compensation in the first quarter of due to the tender offer 
all shares of restricted stock issued pursuant to the tender offer were issued under the company s stock incentive plan and are fully vested  but remain subject to transfer restrictions 
results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share for the same period in the decline in net income of approximately million was primarily due to charges recorded during in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million million after tax for estimated damages and legal costs for both the third quarter of and future legal costs in connection with the uilic litigation  the nasd sales practice exam and ongoing disputes with former sales personnel in our advisors channel

revenues are also derived from rule b asset based distribution fees earned on deferred load products  asset based fees earned on the spa product and other variable annuity products 
the decline in underwriting and distribution fee revenues of million  or  is primarily due to lower revenues from front load investment product sales in our waddell reed advisors channel consisting primarily of commissions on class a shares and variable annuities and lower revenues from sales of insurance products

the decline in proprietary investment product sales was a reflection of poor equity markets in the previous two years and the fact that our investment sales improvement from our retail customers typically lags behind improvements in the markets 
sales by our proprietary sales force have improved during the last four months of as investor sentiment improved with the strong equity markets in and our advisor productivity has increased due to changes implemented within the waddell reed advisors channel 
revenues from insurance products declined by due to a decrease in sales of fixed annuities as interest rates remained low and lower sales of other insurance products as the number of financial advisors decreased in poor market conditions 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in asset based fees earned on our spa products in revenues from the spa product increased by  directly corresponding to a increase in spa average assets under management

net cash provided by all borrowings totaled million in in  we used debt proceeds to repurchase million common shares outstanding  the aggregate cost of which was million 
we also paid million in cash dividends in we renewed our day revolving credit facility  effective october   with various lenders for a total of million  whereby the lenders could  at their option upon our request  expand the facility to million 
there are no balances outstanding under this line of credit at december  or at any time during the most restrictive provisions of our borrowing arrangements are included in our revolving credit facility  which requires a consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed to for four consecutive quarters and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than to for four consecutive quarters 
we were in compliance with these covenants during and future capital requirements we expect significant uses of cash in to include expected dividend payments  interest payments on outstanding debt  share repurchases and potential acquisitions 
management believes its available cash  marketable securities  and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating and capital requirements for we may continue to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time  as management deems appropriate 
share repurchases should be financed by our available cash and investments and or cash from operations 
long term capital requirements include capital expenditures primarily for enhancement of technology infrastructure  strategic acquisitions  payment of dividends  repayment and servicing of the company s debt obligations and repurchases of the company s stock

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we rely on historical experience  third party professionals  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  and litigation contingencies 
additionally  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies 
valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  calculated based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets  the carrying values of these assets are reduced to fair value 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill as of december  our total intangible assets and goodwill was million  or  of our total assets 
two significant considerations arise with respect to these assets that require management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation of impairment 
in connection with all of our acquisitions  an evaluation is completed to determine reasonable purchase price allocations 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the various products  distribution channels  and business strategies 
for example  certain growth rates and operating margins were assumed for different products and distribution channels 
if actual growth rates or operating margins  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could be subject to charges for impairment in the future 
we complete an ongoing review of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets using a fair value based approach on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the approach for the review of goodwill has two steps  the first being to identify a potential impairment and a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually using a one step approach that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
factors that are considered important in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers  significant changes in our business and products  material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being evaluated 
because of the significance of goodwill to our consolidated balance sheets  the annual impairment analysis is critical 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a detailed evaluation was performed as of june  as a result of these analyses  it was determined that no impairment of goodwill or intangibles existed as the fair value of each business unit exceed its carrying value 
see note goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of taxable income for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  including the determination of any valuation allowances that might be required for deferred tax assets 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of the current reporting period based on our belief that operating income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trend of positive operating income changes  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
pensions and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for other postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we use certain assumptions  including  but not limited to  the selection of i the discount rate used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  ii the expected return on plan assets  and iii the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected future market conditions 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates  future pension costs and funding requirements may change materially 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of the other than temporary decline in the value of our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
litigation contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records an accrual for losses related to litigation at such time an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount of the range will be recorded 
in addition  it is the company s policy to include legal costs that it expects to incur in connection with a loss contingency as part of the loss contingency charge 
see note contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of legal proceedings 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and sfas r 
sfas r revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits plans and requires additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
this amendment to sfas was adopted by the company in in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities as revised in december  fin r 
this interpretation changes the method of determining whether certain entities should be included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
an entity is subject to fin r and is called a variable interest entity vie if it has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations  or that do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity 
a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is the party involved with the vie that is expected to absorb a majority of the expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin r apply to all vies created after january  for vies that existed prior to february   the provisions of fin r are generally effective beginning with the first interim or annual period ending after december  at this time  the company does not anticipate that fin r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonability and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
risk factors we are at risk of litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and adversely impact our earnings 
the company announced on october  that it was recording a charge of million million after tax to recognize liabilities for estimated damages and legal costs in connection with the uilic litigation  the nasd sales practice exam  and ongoing disputes with former sales personnel as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in this charge were third quarter legal expenses related to these matters 
actual damages for these litigation matters potentially could exceed our best estimate of damages for the litigation charge 
these matters and other legal matters could result in additional costs to the company and divert resources and management s attention from operations 
such additional costs and diversions could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
we could experience adverse effects on our revenues  profits and market share due to strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage firms  investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  internet investment sites  and other financial institutions and individual registered investment advisers 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer an ever increasing number of other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services  and brand recognition and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable those fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us  our market share  revenues  and income could decline 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely impact our prospects and the operations of our business 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital if needed which could negatively impact our liquidity  prospects and operations 
we have entered into a day revolving credit facility with various lenders for a total of million  whereby the lenders could  at their option upon our request  expand the facility to million 
in august  we also began utilizing money market loans  which function similarly to commercial paper 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit and the outstanding balance related to the money market loans was million 
the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility and the money market loans impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  merge  sell assets  pay dividends  and create or incur liens 
our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions  a breach of which could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon  and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  asset values  perception of our creditworthiness  and indirectly  the market value of our stock 
these factors will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other circumstances  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing credit facility or its refinancing  money market loans  and or cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our business plans  meet our operating expenses  and service our debt obligations as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
non compliance with regulations or changes in regulations could have a significant impact on the conduct of our business and our prospects  revenues and earnings 
our investment management business is heavily regulated  primarily at the federal level 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues  and earnings 
in addition  changes in current legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  compliance requirements or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues  and earnings by increasing expenses and reducing investor interest in certain products offered by the company  among other things 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends which could adversely affect our stock price 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our class a common stock  however  the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition  and contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period s 
any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect our stock price 
our ability to hire and retain key personnel and financial advisors is significant to our success and growth 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive 
we are dependent on waddell reed advisors and select wholesale distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality  quantity  and productivity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds 
good relative performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good relative performance also attracts institutional and separate accounts 
conversely  poor relative performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares and the loss of institutional and separate accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
our revenues  earnings and prospects could be adversely affected if the securities markets decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
these adverse economic factors may be exacerbated by war or terrorism 
as a result of the significant declines in the securities markets and highly publicized financial scandals during and and the market timing and late trading issues within the mutual fund industry during  investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets 
the existence of adverse market conditions and lack of investor confidence  together with uncertainty surrounding terrorist threats and geopolitical tensions could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings  and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  investment management fees based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets adversely affects our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets  and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
the combination of adverse markets reducing sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially affect earnings 
adverse conditions in the us domestic stock market are particularly material to us due to high concentration of assets under management in that market 
systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our clients 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting  and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be sure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our employees and or advisors could result in liability to our clients and subject us to regulatory sanctions 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds for our clients as well as financial and personal information 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors  can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
there may be an adverse effect on our revenues and profits if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that  as required by law  are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders  as required by law 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or may not be renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under certain conditions  the rights under our stockholders rights plan entitle the holders of such rights to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
the rights are attached to each share of our outstanding class a common stock and generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power represented by our class a common stock 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer  or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer  or takeover is in their best interests  and even if such a transaction could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
our board is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election  and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board 
in addition  as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
we may have difficulty executing our acquisition strategy or integrating our acquired companies  which could negatively impact our growth and profits 
our business strategy continues to contemplate our selective pursuit of acquisitions and alliances that will add new products or alternative distribution systems to accelerate earnings growth 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to realize our acquisition strategy or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for desired acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be successful in the integration of acquired companies 
an acquisition may not prove to add new products or distribution systems or otherwise be advantageous to us 
our holding company structure results in structural subordination and may affect our ability to fund our operations and make payments on our debt 
we are a holding company and  accordingly  substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including million of our senior notes  is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries  and we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans  or other payments by our subsidiaries to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans  or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans  or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets  would be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize various financial instruments with certain inherent market risks  primarily related to interest rates and securities prices 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed relate to interest rates on debt and marketable securities 
generally  these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
management actively monitors these risk exposures 
a portion of our risk is hedged with a derivative instrument the swap on our notes  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
as a matter of policy  we only execute derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for speculative or trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in other parts of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are incorporated herein by reference  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to us 
interest rate sensitivity our interest sensitive liabilities include our long term fixed rate senior notes and obligations for any balances outstanding under our credit facility or other short term borrowings 
increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decrease in the fair value of the senior notes and an increase in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
decreases in market interest rates would generally cause an increase in the fair value of the senior notes and a decrease in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
based upon short term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
based upon long term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
on march   our million fixed rate senior notes maturing in february the notes were effectively converted to variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we have agreed with another party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and various floating rate interest amounts  calculated using a notional amount of million 
the difference in the floating rate interest paid and the fixed rate interest received is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense during the period that the related debt is outstanding 
as of december   the floating rate being paid was 
the average floating rate paid on the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by adjusting the carrying amounts of the notes by an offsetting amount for the swap 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we account for the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the notes 
this interest rate swap is considered effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the notes arising from changes in interest rates  and accordingly  there has been no impact on earnings resulting from any ineffectiveness associated with this transaction 
interest expense savings realized as a result of the hedge was approximately million and million for years ending december  and  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a cumulative increase in other assets of million to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap and a cumulative increase in long term debt of million to reflect the fair value of the notes 
available for sale investments sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade debt securities and equity mutual funds 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale investments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and  are consequently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
any unrealized gain or loss is recognized upon the sale of the investment 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates or a sharp decline in the us stock market could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary by management  the cost basis of the individual security or mutual fund is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
conversely  declines in interest rates or a significant rise in the us stock market could have a material positive impact on our investment portfolio 
however  unrealized gains are not recognized until the investment is sold 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
securities price sensitivity our revenues are dependent on the underlying assets under management in the funds to which investment advisory services are provided 
the funds include portfolios of investments comprised of various combinations of equity  bond  and other types of securities 
fluctuations in the value of these securities are common and are generated by numerous factors  including  without limitation  market volatility  the overall economy  inflation  changes in investor strategies  availability of alternative investment vehicles  government regulations and others 
accordingly  declines in any one or a combination of these factors  or other factors not separately identified  may reduce the value of investment securities and  in turn  the underlying assets under management on which our revenues are earned 
these declines have an impact in our investment sales  thereby compounding the impact on our earnings
