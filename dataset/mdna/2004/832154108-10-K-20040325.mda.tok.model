item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview our business model is based primarily upon the design  production and sale of software and connectivity kits for use with wireless communication networks worldwide 
our products are utilized with major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of cell phones or other wireless communication devices such as pc cards 
wireless network providers generally incorporate our products into their accessory products sold directly to individual consumers to offer wireless pc data connectivity to their wireless networks 
our business is primarily dependent upon the demand for wireless communications and the corresponding requirements for software and connectivity kits to support this demand 
during the last three years  demand for these types of products has fluctuated dramatically  and there has been a significant increase in price competition within our industry 
these factors have led to swings in our revenues and contributed to the operating losses reported in our financial results 
we continue to invest in research and development of wireless software products  and we believe that we have one the industry s leading wireless product lines in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our out of the box design technology further differentiates for our products 
we also sell ebusiness and utility software and professional consulting services related to ebusiness applications 
during  we have maintained a sharp focus on our operating cost structure while ensuring that we maintain our operating flexibility to support future growth in the industry 
we measure success by monitoring our net sales and gross margins and operating cash flow while striving to achieve profitability 
we believe that there continues to be excellent growth opportunities within the wireless communications software marketplace and we continue to focus on positioning smith micro to benefit from these opportunities

we traditionally have relatively little backlog for our oem products at any given time and we have not considered backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
as of december  however  we reported a backlog of million resulting from orders placed late in the fourth quarter and not shipped 
since we generally do not produce software in advance of anticipated orders our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter

selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing decreases of  or  from to and million or  from to our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
the decrease in these costs is attributable to cost reduction measures in all the above expense areas as implemented by management  and a reduced emphasis on retail channel marketing activities in and as compared to advertising expenses were   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our wireless  diagnostic  utility and internet software technologies 
the increase in our research and development expenses in the current year was primarily due to the development of new wireless and macintosh products that were released during the year  an increase in headcount and a refocus of engineering resources from consulting projects to development 
these increases were offset in prior years by cost reduction efforts implemented by management  primarily headcount related  in and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  from to  is due to decreased bad debt expense of approximately  and the cessation of goodwill amortization of  the decrease was also due to reductions in compensation and professional services implemented by management

as of december   all amounts have been paid

provision for income taxes 
in the years ended december  and december   we reported a provision for income taxes in the amounts of  and  respectively 
in the year ended december   we reported an income tax benefit in the amount of million 
this benefit is the result of a net operating loss carry back  which  pursuant to a change in federal tax law  allowed us to file for a refund of income taxes paid in prior to the tax law change such amount was included in the net operating loss carry forward  which had carried a full valuation allowance 
the provision in consists of minimum payments for state taxes 
the provision for income taxes in is primarily due to taxes on foreign income  which may vary significantly from year to year 
we completed a tax audit during the first quarter of  resulting in a payment of  the payment was offset by foreign tax credits in the amount of liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from net proceeds of million generated by our initial public offering in our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million 
net cash used in operations was  in compared with net cash provided by operations of  in this difference in operating cash flows is primarily due to the lower net loss in  which includes the effect of a significant income tax refund 
additionally  accounts receivable decreased dramatically in as a result of improved collections and a decrease in shipments to retail distributors but increased slightly in in  this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of cost cutting measures implemented by management 
cash flows used in investing activities were  in and  in  related to investments in property and equipment  including computers and production equipment 
cash flows from financing activities were  in this was the result of stock options being exercised by employees  net of cash used in the first quarter to repurchase company stock 
cash flows from financing activities were insignificant in at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent periods 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we are currently in the process of renegotiating a long term facility lease to replace the lease on our corporate headquarters  which expired at the end of march we have a non cancelable operating lease for our facility in lee s summit  missouri that expires in august 
table of contents as of december   we had no debt and no long term liabilities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total during our normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include intellectual property indemnities to our customers and licensees in connection with the use  sale and or license of our products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct  indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts  and indemnities to directors and officers of the company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
in addition  we have made contractual commitments to employees providing for severance payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software revenue is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to seller is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
we may permit reseller customers to return or exchange product and may provide price protection on products unsold by a customer 
as a result  revenue from resellers is recognized upon sell through to the end customer  rather than upon shipment 
product sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 

table of contents service revenues include sales of consulting services  website hosting and fulfillment 
we recognize service revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain a bad debt reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and no impairment was identified 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at december  estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units changes  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we currently have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that it becomes more likely than not that we will recover such assets  we would be required to reverse some or all of the valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no

elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  
table of contents at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while  the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are required to follow the prescribed disclosure format and have provided the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
for the years ended december  and see notes and and also provided the disclosures in our quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ended march  in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  we adopted the provisions of fin effective february  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since we currently have no variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued fin r with respect to variable interest entities created before january   which among other things  revised the implementation date to the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities spe 
the consolidation requirements apply to all spe s in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  we adopted the provisions of fin r effective december  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since we currently have no spe s 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
