all references to fiscal years are references to our fiscal year ended april overview cutter buck designs  sources  markets and distributes high quality men s and women s sportswear under the cutter buck brand 
we sell our products primarily through golf pro shops and resorts  corporate accounts  upscale specialty retail stores  and international distributors and licensees 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  our strategy focused on managing our gross profit and the profitability of our core wholesale business 
because we have positioned the cutter buck brand to represent a superior product available at select locations  we have foregone some sales opportunities that would have generated a lower gross profit 
our sales have also been affected by the difficult economic conditions faced by customers in our target markets 
during most of our fiscal year  the number of golf rounds played were down  corporate spending on marketing and events was curtailed  and specialty retailers faced declining sales 
we have recently seen some growth in the specialty retail and corporate markets as the economy begins to improve and we focus our products more closely on our target markets 
we believe our brand is strong and we are well positioned within these markets  and as the economic turnaround becomes more widespread we are in a good position to grow our brand 
as part of the ongoing optimization of our organizational structure  in january we converted of our sales representatives from employees to independent sales representatives 
before the conversion  approximately half of our sales representatives were employees and half were independent 
after the conversion  virtually all of our sales representatives are independent 
this conversion was structured to have no impact on selling expenses or customer service 
since the conversion was completed  we have not experienced any significant impact on turnover or selling expenses 
during fiscal  we restructured our business to focus our efforts on our wholesale business and reduce our operating costs 
to understand the performance of our wholesale business  management considers it useful to review our operating results excluding costs that are not elements of running our wholesale business on an ongoing basis  such as restructuring and restatement expenses and costs related to our former retail store and european operations 
we adjust our net income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to exclude income and expense items that are not directly related to our wholesale business  in order to give us better information regarding the profitability of our wholesale business 
we use this analysis to compare pretax wholesale business income on a quarterly and year to date basis 
year ended april  in thousands net income loss as reported    income loss from discontinued retail operations  income tax expense benefit  pre tax income expense of closed european operations restructuring and asset impairment expenses   restatement expenses   ongoing wholesale business income before tax    we are now focusing on strengthening the upscale positioning of the cutter buck brand  and refining the execution of all of our business processes to enable the highest level of customer satisfaction 
the goal of this strategy is to increase net sales while maintaining our gross profit 
we are focusing on the needs of our customers within each strategic business unit  and updating our styles and adding products to meet those needs 
this is a long term strategy to grow our business and  due in part to the long product lead times in this industry  we remain relatively cautious about sales for the next six months in relation to last year 
in addition  we are currently searching for a successor to our ceo 
once retained  that individual will be responsible for helping the board position our brand in the market and chart the company s strategic direction  which may result in some change in our current brand positioning and strategy 
in order to reach these goals  we are investing in design talent and market research  and the development of management information systems to improve our processes and continue our commitment to customer service 
we plan to upgrade and replace some of our computer systems  and we expect the new systems to provide significantly improved management information and support for our future operations 
we will also invest in marketing to expand our brand awareness within our sbu target markets 
we expect these investments in our business to result in increased expenses in these areas over the next fiscal year 
however  we expect these increases in expenses to ultimately be offset by increases in sales and improvements in operating efficiencies 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  certain consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
for all periods presented in this section  results of operations reflect the classification of our company owned retail store operating results and loss on disposal of these stores as discontinued retail operations 
year ended april  consolidated statements of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses depreciation selling  general and administrative restructuring and asset impairment restatement expenses total operating expenses operating income loss interest income expense interest expense interest income net interest income expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax net income loss year ended april  compared to the year ended april  net sales during fiscal net sales decreased approximately million or to million 
during fiscal  we focused on improving our gross profit 
because we have foregone some sales opportunities with lower gross profits  our net sales have decreased compared to fiscal although our gross profit has increased over the same period 
the detail of net sales by sbu was as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail international other total during fiscal year  net sales within our golf sbu decreased by million to million from million in the prior year 
net sales in our golf sbu were impacted by a slower economic recovery in the high end golf apparel segment 
our sales were also impacted as we hired and trained sales representatives who were new to the cutter buck brand 
net sales within our corporate sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
our corporate sales were affected in fiscal by cautious corporate spending on marketing programs  changes in the cycle of new product releases and discontinuation of some designs 
in january  we launched a new corporate catalog featuring new designs  which has had a positive impact on sales 
our net sales in this sbu increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and we expect sales in this sbu to continue to show improvement as corporate customers begin increasing spending on marketing programs 
net sales within our specialty retail sbu increased million to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the success of our collegiate and pro sports sales programs 
net sales within our international sbu decreased approximately million to million from million in the prior year 
net sales within this sbu decreased as we continued to shift from distributor relationships to licensee relationships during fiscal in addition  for fiscal net sales in our international sbu included approximately million in revenue generated by selling inventory to eurostyle ltd 
in conjunction with establishing a licensing relationship with them 
net sales within our other sbu  including liquidation sales  shipping revenue and our e commerce business  increased million to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to increases in our e commerce business and liquidation sales 
gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit was of net sales  compared to in fiscal our margins have increased as we focused on reducing our product returns and allowances  improved our sourcing  adjusted our pricing structure for certain products and reduced discounting 
our product returns and allowances decreased significantly during fiscal due to intensive management 
as a result  we updated the estimates we use to calculate the reserve for product returns and allowances 
these updated estimates resulted in a reduction of charges to product returns and allowances of million 
we also realized a reduction of approximately million in our inbound freight and import costs 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include all costs related to their distribution network in the cost of sales 
we have consistently included inbound freight charges in cost of sales  and included other costs of distribution in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation depreciation expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal depreciation expense decreased during fiscal primarily due to investments in our inventory management systems becoming fully depreciated  the disposal of assets no longer used in our operations and phasing out investments in sales fixturing 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense related to new capital expenditures 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million in fiscal compared to million in  a decrease of million or  and was unchanged as a percentage of net sales at in fiscal and fiscal salaries  sales commissions and related taxes decreased by approximately million due to a decrease in sales  savings resulting from our restructuring plans and internal cost cutting measures 
this decrease was offset by an increase in benefits  incentive bonuses and other employee expenses of million 
sample expenses decreased approximately million  and supply and printing expenses decreased approximately million  primarily due to internal cost cutting measures and lower sales levels 
rent expense decreased by approximately million primarily due to closing two showrooms and consolidating operations at our corporate headquarters and distribution center 
bad debt expense decreased approximately million primarily due to increased management of credit exposures 
these decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately million in legal and other professional fees and million in advertising expenses 
during fiscal  we plan to invest in design talent  marketing initiatives  and management information systems 
we expect these investments in our business to result in increased expenses in these areas 
however  we expect these increases to ultimately be offset by increases in sales and improvements in operating efficiencies 
we also expect to incur additional costs to comply with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of restructuring and asset impairment we have two restructuring plans  the restructuring plan and the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan included closing our wholly owned european subsidiary  refining our company owned retail store strategy  closing four under performing company owned retail stores  consolidating and restructuring our women s line sales force  discontinuing our golf shoe business  discontinuing the dressier side of our women s line  recording losses on subleases of excess warehouse capacity and certain management changes 
the restructuring plan covered the closure of the remaining ten retail stores 
costs associated with the restructuring plan  excluding costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores  are included in restructuring and asset impairment expenses 
costs associated with the restructuring plan and the costs associated with refining our retail strategy and closing our retail stores included in the restructuring plan are included in discontinued retail operations 
we had a million reversal of previously recognized restructuring and asset impairment expenses for fiscal  compared to expenses of million in fiscal the million reduction in expenses primarily related to reserve adjustments for accounts receivable from former officers  which have now been settled 
our restructuring plans are now complete 
the remaining liability recorded for the restructuring plan relates to the sublease of our excess warehouse capacity at our distribution center  and will be amortized through the end of the lease term in in fiscal  the million in expenses consisted of million related to losses on subleases of our excess warehouse capacity at our distribution center and million related to additional reserves against accounts receivable balances with former officers 
restatement expenses in fiscal  we restated certain of our historical financial statements for irregularities and errors 
as a result of the circumstances underlying the restatement  three shareholder class action lawsuits and a shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed  naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants 
we settled those lawsuits and paid million to the plaintiffs 
we also settled the previously announced securities and exchange commission investigation of the company arising from the circumstances underlying the restatement 
that settlement did not require payment of any fines or penalties 
restatement expenses totaled approximately million for the year ended april  and included million of legal and professional fees  of which million we have advanced in connection with the indemnification of former officers  million of accrued retention bonuses to certain key employees and million of amortization of the premium for the replacement directors and officers liability insurance 
retention bonuses totaled million  the majority of which was paid out in the fourth quarter of fiscal although the restatement has been completed  we expect to continue to incur legal and other professional service costs in connection with the indemnification of former officers and the appeal of our lawsuit against genesis insurance company 
these expenses cannot be estimated at this time 
operating income loss as a result of the above items  operating income was million in fiscal compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal income taxes we recorded approximately million of income tax expense in fiscal compared to  of income tax benefit in fiscal the effective rates for income taxes in fiscal and were and  respectively 
in fiscal we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
based on the level of our historical taxable income and forecasts for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences were anticipated to reverse  management believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would be unable to realize the full benefit of our deferred tax assets 
considering the fiscal results and forecasts for future taxable income  management determined that it is now more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these assets 
therefore  in fiscal we reversed the allowance of million 
in addition  income tax expense for the year was reduced by million related to the reconciliation of the tax provision to the income tax return as filed for fiscal and changes in estimates of our income tax liabilities 
we will periodically review the necessity for an allowance as taxable income is generated or there are changes in our estimates of future taxable income and the expected realization of deferred tax assets 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  net sales during fiscal net sales decreased approximately million or to million 
the detail of net sales by sbu was as follows year ended april  increase decrease percent change in millions  except percent change golf corporate specialty retail international other total some of the decline in sales in each sbu may have been attributable to customers fears about our stability after the announcement of the need to restate earnings 
during fiscal year  net sales within our golf sbu decreased by million to million from million in the prior year 
net sales within our golf sbu continued to be negatively impacted by the economy and flat demand due to an oversupply of product in the golf marketplace and a decrease in the number of rounds played 
net sales within our corporate sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year as corporate customers spent less on marketing programs 
during the first quarter of fiscal we launched a new corporate catalog that had a positive impact on sales in the remainder of fiscal net sales within our specialty retail sbu decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
specialty retail sales decreased as a result of the discontinuation of our dressier women s line and the difficult conditions facing independent specialty stores 
net sales within our international sbu decreased by approximately million to million from million in the prior year 
for fiscal  net sales within our international sbu included approximately million in sales generated by our european subsidiary 
this subsidiary was closed and substantially liquidated at the end of fiscal as a result  net sales for fiscal year did not include any direct european sales 
our european operations were replaced with a licensing relationship with eurostyle ltd 
eurostyle effective may  because we no longer sell directly in europe  we generate licensing revenues  instead of direct sales  on all sales of our products in that market 
these licensing revenues are calculated as a percentage of net sales of our products by eurostyle 
the decrease in sales resulting from closing our european operations was partially offset by an increase in licensing and royalty income 
net sales within our other sbu include liquidation sales and shipping revenue  and decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower liquidation sales in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit was of net sales  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  our gross profit was impacted by inventory write downs  lower margins on liquidation sales and higher off price discounts 
inventory write downs were recorded as part of our restructuring plan  which included closure of our european operations and exiting the dressier side of our women s line and our golf shoe business

restatement expenses we restated certain of our historical financial statements for irregularities and errors in fiscal as a result of the restatement  three shareholder class action lawsuits and a shareholder derivative lawsuit were filed  naming us and certain of our current and former directors and officers as defendants 
during fiscal we reached an agreement to settle these lawsuits  including our agreement to pay million in cash plus up to an additional million based on a formula applied to any recovery in our ongoing suit against genesis insurance company 
restatement expenses totaled approximately million for the year ended april  and included the million settlement charge  million of legal and professional fees  million of accrued retention bonuses to certain key employees and million of amortization of the premium for the replacement directors and officers liability insurance and other restatement costs 
although the restatement has been completed  we will continue to incur legal and other professional service costs in connection with the indemnification of former officers and the ongoing lawsuit against genesis insurance company 
these expenses cannot be estimated at this time 
in addition  there will be an ongoing charge each quarter until march for the retention bonus  which aggregated to million paid in march operating income loss as a result of the above items  operating loss decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal income taxes we recorded approximately  of income tax benefit in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the effective rates for income taxes in fiscal and were and  respectively 
this decrease in our fiscal effective rate resulted from the establishment of a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets and non deductible restructuring and asset impairment expenses 
loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax during fiscal  our board of directors determined that we should focus our resources on our wholesale business and close our retail stores 
although the retail stores provided a showcase for our product lines  the operation of the stores did not provide a satisfactory financial return 
all stores were closed as of april  the fiscal loss from discontinued retail operations  net of tax  was million compared to million in fiscal the loss from discontinued retail operations in includes retail store closure expenses of million pretax million net of tax

as a guaranty of hilco s performance we receive a guaranteed payment of of the aggregate retail price of the inventory being liquidated 
as compensation for its services  hilco received a base fee of up to of the retail price of the liquidation inventory plus all expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation event  including store level operating expenses

quarterly results and seasonality our business is seasonal  and this seasonality is primarily attributable to delivery dates of our spring and fall lines and to the timing of shipments to golf pro shops and specialty retail stores 
other factors contributing to the variability of our quarterly results include seasonal fluctuations in consumer demand  the timing and amount of orders from key customers  the timing and magnitude of sales of seasonal remainder merchandise and availability of product 
this pattern of sales creates seasonal fluctuations in profitability  working capital financing and liquidity levels 
we generally experience our lowest level of net sales in the third quarter  and the highest level of net sales in the fourth quarter

during fiscal  our capital requirements were funded by cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated from our net income of million in fiscal compared to our net loss of million in fiscal we also realized a significant decrease in inventory in fiscal as a result of more intensive inventory management  compared to an increase in inventory in fiscal these changes were partially offset by a smaller decrease in our accounts receivable in fiscal  primarily due to a lower level of net sales  and smaller decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  primarily due to lower inventory levels and the payment of the shareholder lawsuit settlement 
net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the purchase of short term investments in fiscal we invest in interest bearing us government and high quality corporate debt instruments and hold these instruments to maturity  which averages days or less 
at april  we held million in short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million  which primarily consisted of payments under capital lease obligations 
in addition  in december we received a federal tax refund of million 
at april   our cash and cash equivalents were million compared to million at april  on march  we entered into a loan agreement with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo as agent and wells fargo century  an affiliate of wells fargo  as collateral agent and lender for a million line of credit that expires in march this replaced our previous line of credit that expired on march  the amount of credit available to us under this agreement is determined by a formula based on our accounts receivable and inventory balances 
the amount of our available credit fluctuates as these balances fluctuate  and may at times be less than the maximum million available under the agreement 
we use this line of credit to support our trade financing with letters of credit 
we may also use the line for operating expenses  although we do not currently do so 
this loan agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants covering minimum net worth  minimum working capital and maximum capital expenditures 
these financial covenants require that we maintain a tangible net worth of at least million and working capital of at least million at all times  and limit capital expenditures to not more than million in fiscal and fiscal we were in compliance with these covenants at april  to support our operations  capital expenditures totaling approximately million are planned for fiscal these capital expenditures will primarily consist of information technology initiatives  as we plan to upgrade and replace some of our computer systems 
we plan to negotiate a waiver with wells fargo for the loan covenant limiting our capital expenditures to million in fiscal wells fargo has indicated to us that a waiver would likely be granted for these expenditures 
other significant uses of cash included the payment of retention bonuses  payment of cash dividends  and repurchases of our common stock 
in fiscal  we paid approximately million in retention bonuses in the fourth quarter  and we will pay an additional million in fiscal plus approximately million under our transition agreement with our ceo 
on march  the board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend and a stock repurchase program 
a dividend of a share  totaling million  was paid on april  to shareholders of record on march  the board has declared a second dividend payable on july  to shareholders of record on july   and we expect to pay similar dividends in future quarters 
the share repurchase program authorizes the purchase of up to million in company stock 
the purchases will be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of  for a total repurchase of million 
the repurchase program may be suspended at any time without notice 
the timing of repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions  alternative uses of capital and other factors 
we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations  as well as our ability to borrow under bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements during fiscal we also have available alternative sources of financing  including factoring our accounts receivable and financing our capital expenditures with leases 
although these methods of financing are currently available to us  we do not anticipate using alternative sources of financing during fiscal however  our capital needs will depend on many factors  including our growth rate  the need to finance increased production and inventory levels  the success of our various sales and marketing programs  expenses associated with the risks and uncertainties related to our restatement and various other factors 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of april  contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands capital leases letters of credit   operating leases      retention bonuses restructuring liabilities  the letters of credit and operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
foreign currency exchange risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
in conjunction with the closing of our european operations  we have some remaining assets and liabilities denominated in euros 
these balances are not material to our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent we have assets and liabilities denominated in euros that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s filing on form k for the year ended april  our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these losses are included in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
reserve for product returns we maintain an estimate of potential future product returns related to current period product receivables 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of this reserve  and update our estimate based on our actual results 
the estimate for product returns is included in our calculation of net sales 
if we were to experience an increase in our product returns  additional reserves may be required 
reserve for sales allowances we maintain an estimate of future sales allowances related to current period sales 
we analyze the rate of historical sales allowances when evaluating the adequacy of this reserve  and update our estimate based on our actual results 
the estimate for sales allowances is included in our calculation of net sales 
if we were to grant additional sales allowances  additional reserves may be required 
inventories inventories  which are predominantly finished goods  are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
we perform a detailed analysis of inventory on a quarterly basis to identify unsold out of season golf and specialty retail merchandise 
we estimate the net realizable value of the out of season merchandise based upon disposition plans and historical experience 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying amount of out of season merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying values of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
restructuring liabilities restructuring related liabilities consist of estimates for losses on anticipated disposition of lease obligations 
key variables in determining this estimate include the anticipated timing of sublease rentals  estimates of sublease rental payment amounts and estimates for brokerage and other related costs 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust our estimates based on currently available information 
valuation allowance in deferred income tax assets we periodically review the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset balances to their net realizable value 
to the extent we determine an allowance is required  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our historical taxable income and forecasts of future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse 
if our actual results are lower than our forecasted future results  additional allowances may be required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rate risks associated with financial instruments included in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest in interest bearing us government and high quality corporate debt instruments and hold these instruments until maturity  which averages days or less 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair market value of these instruments 
due to the short term nature of these instruments and our investment policies and procedures  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes
