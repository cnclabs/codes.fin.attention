forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results  performance or achievements of healthtronics surgical services to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements express or implied by such forward looking statements 
as always  these expectations and projections are based on currently available competitive  financial  and economic data  along with operating plans  and are subject to future events and uncertainties 
among the events and uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are inability to establish or maintain relationships with physicians and hospitals  health care regulatory developments that prevent certain transactions with health care professionals or facilities  inability of the company or health care providers to obtain reimbursement for use of the company s current or future products  competition or technological change that impacts the market for the company s products  difficulty integrating hmt and realizing projected cost savings  unanticipated regulatory and clinical costs related to fda approval of hifu  and difficulty in managing the company s growth 
additional factors that might cause such a difference  include  but are not limited to those discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report and the items identified under the caption risk factors in item of this report 
overview we provide equipment as well as technical and administrative services to physicians  hospitals  and surgery centers performing minimally invasive surgical procedures in the urologic and orthopaedic markets  including lithotripsy and orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery 
we were formed in december and began offering lithotripsy services in mid in october  we received fda approval to market an orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery device  the ossatron  and since then we have invested significant resources in developing our orthopaedic services network while expanding our lithotripsy operations 
our services are provided principally through limited partnerships or other entities that we manage which use lithotripsy devices or the ossatron orthopaedic shock wave device 
many of these partnerships were formed by us  and we have retained an equity interest ranging from to while selling any remaining interests primarily to physicians 
we generally retain the sole managing interest in the entities and manage their daily operations 
we also provide equipment maintenance services to some of the partnerships and supply them with various consumables used in lithotripsy and orthotripsy extracorporeal shock wave surgery procedures 
to date we have expanded our operations by securing additional facility contracts in our existing partnerships and forming partnerships in new geographic markets and acquiring interests in partnerships from third parties  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
as a result of the control we exert over those entities by virtue of our sole managing interest  management contract and otherwise  for financial reporting purposes we consolidate the results of operations of the partnerships with our own even though we own less than all and in many cases less than of their outstanding equity interests 
we reflect the equity of third party partners in the partnerships results of operations in our consolidated statements of income and on our consolidated balance sheet as minority interest 
in certain instances  we do not control partnerships or other entities in which we have ownership interests 
we account for our interests in these entities either on the equity or cost basis  depending on the degree of influence we exert over the entity 
we recognize revenue in our consolidated statements of income from the following three principal sources fees for clinical services provided by the company or partnerships 
a substantial majority of our consolidated revenues is derived from technical fees relating to treatments performed using our equipment and related services 
we bill for these fees under two different models 
under the wholesale billing model  we charge a fee to the hospital or other surgery center at which the treatment is performed 
our fee might be a set fee per procedure  a set fee per month based on a specified number of days of service at the facility per month  or set as a percentage of revenue derived 
under the retail billing model  we charge the patient s insurer  hmo or other responsible party  and we pay a fee to the health care facility for access to its premises 
under either model  the professional fee payable to the physician performing the procedure is generally billed and collected by the physician 
the billing and collection cycle for wholesale fees is typically significantly shorter than for retail fees  although the gross margin for retail billing is moderately higher than for wholesale billing 
technical services  equipment maintenance and sale of consumables to affiliated and unaffiliated third parties 
we charge fees to third parties who own or operate lithotripsy and orthopaedic shock wave surgical devices for equipment maintenance  technical support and related services 
we also sell a variety of consumables used in lithotripsy  orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery  transurethral microwave therapy and cryosurgery procedures to unaffiliated third parties 
equipment sales to third parties 
we generate revenue from the sale of shock wave devices to third parties 
we measure results in each of our areas in part based upon the number of procedures performed 
the number of total kidney stone procedures in the united states should grow slightly with the aging population 
growth for the company in lithotripsy procedures will come from new facility contracts in existing partnerships and the acquisition or affiliation of partners or partnerships 
procedures performed with the ossatron for orthopaedic conditions have significant potential for growth as many patients currently are treated with invasive surgery or continue to suffer pain without receiving treatment 
the company believes procedures for chronic plantar fasciitis and chronic lateral epicondylitis will continue to grow as the modality is accepted by patients  physicians  and third party payors 
the procedure growth for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia has potential for growth due to the aging population and the fact that many patients currently are treated with drugs or other alternative treatments 
the number of procedures for cryosurgical treatment of prostate and other cancers should increase during the year  but such growth will be tempered by the slow process of educating and training physicians on the treatment 
we are dependent  both directly in the case of retail billing and indirectly in the case of wholesale billing  on the reimbursement policies of governmental and private third party payors 
while the reimbursement status of lithotripsy is well established  orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery is a relatively new procedure in the us  and the reimbursement policies of third party payors for this treatment are still developing 
reimbursement for transurethral microwave treatment tumt of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph is currently established and favorable for in office treatments 
cryosurgery for prostate cancer is a hospital based procedure and reimbursement is established but was recently adjusted by medicare to exclude certain pass through charges 
our results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies regarding lithotripsy or by decisions made regarding the reimbursement status of orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery 
results of consolidated operations revenues for totaled million  up from million for the year ended lithotripsy revenue for was million compared to million in  which included approximately million from the sold subsidiary 
this is a decrease from revenues after excluding the sold subsidiary s revenues 
consolidated lithotripsy procedures increased over after excluding  procedures performed in by the sold subsidiary 
certain partnerships underperformed in the early part of the year  but the fourth quarter was strong and showed marked improvement in revenues  consolidated treatments and unconsolidated treatments compared to prior year periods 
even with this growth  we expect the earnings contribution from this segment to decline in because we own less equity in some of our larger partnerships 
we anticipate our lithotripsy business to remain strong and to continue to generate good cash flow for the company 
our orthopaedic business demonstrated strong growth year over year in both procedures and revenues 
in what remains a challenging reimbursement climate  we performed  orthopaedic procedures during  a increase over the  procedures performed in revenues for the orthotripsy business in increased to million from million in we continue to make progress in training physicians and educating insurance companies 
revenue from the equipment sales and service division was million for compared to million for  a decrease of 
the decline in was due in large part to a decrease in sales of lithotripters to third parties as the company focused more on generating revenues from patient procedures 
however  we anticipate this will be a growth area for the company going forward as we expand our sales efforts with the acquisition of hmt holding ag 
our revenues increased to million in compared to million in lithotripsy revenue for was million  up compared to million in the significant increase in lithotripsy revenues is due primarily to the acquisition of the litho group partnerships in december of revenues for the orthotripsy business in increased to million from million in orthopaedic revenues were driven by a  procedure increase from the preceding year 
revenue from the equipment sales and service division was up to million for compared to million for in  we recognized previously deferred revenues related to device sales 
this  coupled with the sale of two additional medical devices  caused the increase 
as our company has grown  our salaries  general and administrative expenses have increased year over year from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  salaries  general and administrative expenses further increased to million for the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to the acquisition of the litho group partnerships december of the expansion of our orthopaedic business has required increased resources in marketing and management causing the increase in with the acquisition of the litho group in december our depreciation and amortization expense increased from million to million in  an increase of 
however  the sale of us lithotripsy in july of caused a decrease to million in as we continue to build and strengthen our partnership base  we buy and sell investment interest in our subsidiaries 
in  these sales were primarily sales of orthotripsy partnership investment interest which generated million in gain on sale of subsidiary and investment interest 
in  sales including the us lithotripsy sale resulted in gains on sale of subsidiary and investment interest of million 
the gains on sale of subsidiary and investment interest in of million were generated primarily by the sales of investment interest in the litho group entities 
our subsidiary partners equity in the current year net income is represented by the minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries 
this minority interest will grow in total as we continue to sell interest in our subsidiaries 
our partners minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries grew from million to million to million from to to  respectively 
results of operations the following table shows certain income statement items expressed as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december   and year ended december  net revenue operating expenses cost of devices  service parts and consumables salaries  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities partnership distributions from cost basis investments gain on sale of subsidiary and investment interest gain on sale of fixed assets interest expense interest income income before minority interest and income taxes minority interest of consolidated subsidiaries income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income quarterly statement of earnings data the following table presents certain quarterly statement of earnings data for the years ended december  and the quarterly statement of earnings data set forth below was derived from our unaudited financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  which we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods 
quarterly statement of earnings data q q q q q q q q s omitted except per share amounts revenues earnings  before income taxes net income diluted earnings per common share earnings per common share amounts are calculated on a quarterly basis and may not total to the annual amount 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of the revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those significant subsidiaries that we control 
they also include our undivided interests in these subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
amounts representing our percentage interest in the underlying net assets of other significant affiliates that we do not control  but over which we exercise significant influence  are included in investments in unconsolidated entities  our share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement of income caption equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
the accounting for these non consolidated companies is referred to as the equity method of accounting 
our investments in other companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence as discussed above are carried at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
revenue recognition  gain recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts net revenue includes treatment fees for medical devices in the clinical setting 
treatment revenue is primarily wholesale or retail 
wholesale revenue is generated primarily from fixed fee contracts with various medical facilities and is recorded in the month the related treatments are performed 
retail revenue  generated when we bill third party payors for medical facility and technical fees  is recorded at the time services are rendered 
these third party billings may or may not be contractual 
adjustments which reduce revenue from established contractual or estimated non contractual billing rates to amounts estimated to be reimbursable are recognized in the period the services are rendered 
differences in estimates recorded and final settlements are reported during the period final settlements are made 
we believe adequate provisions for these final settlements have been reflected in the financial statements  however  in the event that the settlement provisions are inadequate  the results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
we may sell medical devices to certain entities in which we have an interest and may have guaranteed a portion of the long term obligations related to such purchases 
we eliminate profits on such transactions where the purchaser is a consolidated subsidiary of ours 
a pro rata portion of the profit will be deferred on sales to unconsolidated subsidiaries where we have accounted for our investment interest using the equity or cost basis methods of accounting depending on our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the joint venture 
revenue is recognized upon acceptance and delivery at the customer s destination for sales of medical devices to unaffiliated entities 
revenue generated from service contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the related contract 
we form wholly owned limited partnerships in which we are the general partner and then contribute a medical device to the partnership 
we may sell interests in these partnerships to physicians or other investors 
we generally recognize a gain on the interest sold as non operating income at the time the subscription agreement is signed 
certain gains on the sale of partnership interests are deferred when payment terms exceed one year 
in order to record our accounts receivable at their net realizable value  we must assess their collectibility 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make this assessment including the analysis of historical bad debts and other adjustments  a review of the aging of our receivables and the current creditworthiness of our customers 
we have recorded allowances for receivables which we believe are uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues 
however  depending upon how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments became impaired  increases in these allowances may be required 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include medical devices  parts for servicing the medical equipment and consumables for medical equipment 
we continually evaluate the inventory for excess and obsolescence 
at this time we believe that no inventory reserve is required to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
however  if the demand for our product were to decline we might be required to establish such reserves 
long lived assets we have recorded property  plant and equipment and intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the determination of useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually  or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives  which were previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  are no longer being amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our management uses historical experience  current market appraisals and various other assumptions to form the basis for making judgments about the impairment of our assets 
under different assumptions or conditions  the asset impairment analysis may yield a different outcome  which would alter the impairment recognized and the gain or loss on the eventual disposition of the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our continued profitability  we have determined that it is likely that we will realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
in connection with our acquisition of litho group in  we acquired deferred tax assets relating primarily to built in losses and net operating losses 
we have recently completed our section analysis and have determined that it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
therefore we have established a valuation allowance for the portion of the deferred tax asset acquired in the purchase of litho group 
derivative instruments and hedging we manage risks associated with interest rates and we may use derivative instruments to hedge these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and  therefore  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the evaluation of hedge effectiveness is subject to assumptions based on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures 
all derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices 
related party transactions transactions between related parties occur in the normal course of business 
we provide services and products to our subsidiaries  our subsidiaries provide services and products to other subsidiaries 
we eliminate transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries and appropriately disclose other significant related party transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that under the previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas no 
requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  on october   the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas no 
until it could consider some of the resulting implementation issues associated with the measurement and recognition issues 
we have not determined the resulting impact of the adoption of this statement on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting and reporting for derivative instruments 
in particular  this statement amends certain other pronouncements and clarifies the circumstances under which a contract with an initial investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financial component 
the guideline should be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which addresses the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either a not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or b do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation of these entities  known as variable interest entities vies  based on an assessment of which party to the vie  if any  absorbs a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both the primary beneficiary 
fin also requires disclosures about vies that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
fin is effective for all new vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after march  except for companies with special purpose entities which must apply the provisions of fin to those special purpose entities no later than the first reporting period ending after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin  but do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial condition 
we do not consolidate any vies and we do not have any significant variable interests in a vie 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our working capital requirements and capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
in conjunction with the purchase of litho group  inc  we obtained a  credit facility 
at december  and  we had  and  respectively  outstanding under the credit facility and additional debt of  and  respectively  primarily at the subsidiary level 
included in the credit facility is a  line of credit under which  was available at december  debt at the subsidiary level is typically related to equipment purchased and operated by that subsidiary and is secured by that equipment 
cash and cash equivalents decreased from  at december  to  at december  concurrent with the acquisition of hmt holding  ag  on march   the company amended and restated its  bank term loan and line of credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility consists of a  revolving line of credit 
we will continue to fund our working capital requirements and capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under this bank credit facility 
on march   we had  outstanding  and  available under the new revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from  in to  in as a result of a decrease in earnings before depreciation  amortization and minority interest 
included in the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities is a  liability related to cash received pending the sale of lithotripsy partnership interests 
this sale of partnership interests was completed in the first quarter of net cash provided by investing activities was  in compared to cash used in investing activities of  in the investment activity in included approximately  provided by the sale of us lithotripsy  us  while the investment activity included approximately  provided by the sales of equity interest in several subsidiary partnerships 
net cash of  was used by financing activities including approximately  used to pay down debt related to the purchase of litho group  inc compared to the  net cash used by financing activities including approximately  used to pay down debt related to the purchase of lgi 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately  in  primarily for the purchase of mobile medical equipment put in service 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately  to  in for the purchase of additional medical equipment for our consolidated subsidiaries  which may be secured by additional debt at the related partnership 
we continuously review new investment opportunities and believe that our financial position can support higher levels of capital expenditures  if justified by opportunities to increase revenue or decrease recurring costs 
accordingly  it is possible that our capital expenditures in could be higher than anticipated 
we plan to use our cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund these expenditures 
we believe that our cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending needs at least through the end of this and other significant contractual obligations are as follows contractual obligations payments due by period s omitted total less than year years years after years short term borrowings long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations on march   we amended and restated our primary bank term loan 
the revised agreement provides for a million line of credit 
pursuant to our distribution agreement with hmt we have an ongoing commitment to purchase certain medical devices 
based upon current market prices  this commitment is approximately million in note  however  that we have acquired controlling interest in hmt since the end of cautionary statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results  performance or achievements of healthtronics surgical services to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements express or implied by such forward looking statements 
as always  these expectations and projections are based on currently available competitive  financial  and economic data  along with operating plans  and are subject to future events and uncertainties 
among the events and uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are inability to establish or maintain relationships with physicians and hospitals  health care regulatory developments that prevent certain transactions with health care professionals or facilities  inability of the company or health care providers to obtain reimbursement for use of the company s current or future products  competition or technological change that impacts the market for the company s products  difficulty integrating hmt and realizing projected cost savings  unanticipated regulatory and clinical costs related to fda approval of hifu  and difficulty in managing the company s growth 
additional factors that might cause such a difference  include  but are not limited to those discussed in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report and the items identified under the caption risk factors in item of this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in as of december  and  our corporate level fixed rate debt was million and million  respectively  and our corresponding corporate level variable rate debt was million and million  respectively 
based on our variable rate debt at december   in the absence of the swaps discussed below  a one percent change in interest rates would result in an annual change in interest rate expense calculated on a simple interest basis of approximately  in order to protect the company from interest rate volatility  effective february   the company entered into two two year interest rate swap agreements the swaps  with a total notional amount of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the swaps effectively convert a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis through february   thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
this fixed rate is plus the applicable percentage and at december  and  respectively  based on the previous quarter leverage ratio  within the credit facility agreement 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and expired on february  the company believes that its hedge is effective with changes in fair value to be reported in other comprehensive income or loss 
as of december  and  the market value of the derivatives was a liability of  and  respectively  which is included on the accompanying balance sheet 
the related comprehensive loss of  and the related comprehensive gain of  have been recorded during and  respectively 
the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreements is a major commercial bank 
the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate nonperformance of the counterparty
