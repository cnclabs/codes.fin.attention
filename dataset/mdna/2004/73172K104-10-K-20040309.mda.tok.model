overview we are a leading global provider of a line of high quality  easy to use communications equipment that enables enterprise users to more effectively conduct video  voice  data and web communications 
our offerings are organized along four product lines  video communications  voice communications  network systems  and services 
for reporting purposes  we aggregate video communications and voice communications into one segment named communications and report network systems as a separate segment 
services are allocated amongst communications and network systems 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of picturetel inc  a supplier of video communication products 
as a result  the fluctuations in our operating results and our segments in fiscal as compared to the historical results are due generally to the acquisition of picturetel 
the historical results below present a discussion of our consolidated operating results using the historical results of polycom prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for the years ended december   and  including picturetel s results of operations from october  the acquisition date 
in january  we sold to verilink corporation or verilink certain fixed assets and intellectual property rights relating to our network access product line  including our line of netengine integrated devices  for a total of up to million in cash  of which i million was paid to us at closing  ii million was paid to us on the first anniversary of the closing  in january  and iii up to million will be paid to us quarterly based on ten percent of verilink s revenues related to the sale of netengine products 
in  verilink paid us million related to ten percent of verilink s revenues from the sale of netengine products during this period 
our consolidated financial statements reflect our network access product line as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas the results of operations of our network access product line have been classified as discontinued  and prior periods have been reclassified  including the reallocation of general overhead charges to our two remaining reporting segments 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
on january   we completed our acquisition of voyant technologies  inc  or voyant  pursuant to the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  or merger agreement  dated as of november  voyant designs and delivers group voice communication solutions and will be a part of our network systems segment 
see recent developments in item for further information 
voyant s results of operations are not included in our results of operations presented below as the acquisition was completed subsequent to december  during fiscal  and to a lesser extent during the first quarter of fiscal  our performance  and that of the industry as a whole  was impacted negatively by the global economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
while the economic environment remains challenging  technology spending showed signs of improvement and there were indications of an improving economic outlook by the end of fiscal net revenues were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenue primarily reflects reduced sales of our ipower and network systems products and related services 
in addition  during fiscal  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities and increased our cash and cash equivalents by approximately million 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth  as a percentage of net revenues  consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net revenues cost of net revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquisition related costs purchased in process research and development amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill restructure costs litigation settlement total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net loss on strategic investments other income expense  net income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes gain from sale of discontinued operations  net of taxes net income loss net revenues net revenues decreased in over net revenues in the communications and network systems segments  decreased and  respectively in over the decrease in communications was due primarily to decreased sales of ipower video product and service revenue related to the ipower product 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased sales volume of our voice communications products and our video communications products other than ipower 
total video communications net revenues decreased to million in from million in viewstation product revenues  including revenues from our newly launched vsx in the fourth quarter of  increased sequentially in each quarter of ipower net revenues decreased in over  however  ipower video product revenue increased sequentially in each quarter of with the exception of the fourth quarter 
net revenues related to service revenue associated with the ipower related product decreased to million in compared to million reported in ipower service revenue remained flat from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of  but declined from revenues for the first half of voice communications net revenues increased to million in from million in voice communications revenue increased primarily as a result of increases in sales of our installed voice products and circuit switched products  and to a lesser extent increases in our voice over ip products 
also contributing to the overall decrease in net revenues in from was a decrease in our network systems segment revenues to million in from million in this decrease was a result of a reduction in the sales volume of our network systems hardware products and mix shifts to lower end systems with lower average selling prices 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in our upgrade  software and services revenue 
service revenue is included in product revenues for voice  non ipower video and network systems 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased over the same period of net revenues for the year ended december   in the communications and network systems segments  increased and  respectively 
the increase in communications was due primarily to increased sales volume of our video communications products and ipower related services 
our video communications products net revenues increased to million for from million in although the viewstation product line contributed to the increase in video communications net revenues  this growth was primarily due to the addition of the ipower video product line through the acquisition of picturetel in october due to the timing of this acquisition  ipower product revenue is reflected in the prior year numbers only for the fourth quarter of although overall in  video revenue grew  we experienced sequential quarterly revenue decreases in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to declines in our video communications product revenue in both the viewstation and ipower product lines 
the ipower related services net revenues was million for the year ended december  compared to million reported in the same period of  as this revenue stream was also added through the acquisition of picturetel 
voice communications revenue also increased as a result of an increase in sales of our voice over ip and installed voice products  offset by decreases in sales volumes of our circuit switch voice communications products 
the installed voice products were added through our acquisition of a company  aspi  in the fourth quarter of our network systems segment also contributed to the increase in net revenues with an increase in service revenue related to our network systems products for when compared to in the communications segment in  we began to implement a new direct touch strategy in concert with a realignment of our channel partner strategy 
as part of this new channel partner strategy and a result of the recent economic downturn  the channel inventory model has changed to reduce channel inventories at those channel partners that stock product and to move some channel partners to a drop shipment method for their end user customers as opposed to having these partners carry inventory 
during the second quarter of  we believe that we essentially completed our channel inventory reduction program and we believe that  in aggregate  we will see only minor variations  upwards or downwards  in channel inventory weeks within product lines or regions moving forward 
during the third and fourth quarters of and the first half of  we believe our channel partners video and voice inventory decreased over the respective prior periods 
in the third quarter of  channel inventories remained stable 
voice channel inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of  although we did see a slight increase in video channel inventories  primarily as a result of advance purchases of video inventory related to some specific end user opportunities in the first quarter of in the asia pacific region 
the decrease in channel inventories in the last half of was due largely to this shift in channel partner strategy resulting in us shipping fewer video and voice units to channel partners in the third and fourth quarter of  as well as our channel partners lowering inventory levels as a result of lower end user demand 
in the first and second quarters of  we believe that sales of our products by our channel partners to end user customers exceeded the number of units that we shipped to the channel as a result of increased end user demand  thereby decreasing overall inventory at our channel partners 
the decreased channel inventory levels had less impact on sales of ipower video units and our network systems segment products  which are not typically carried in inventory by our channel partners 
in fact  sales of our network systems products for the third and fourth quarters of increased sequentially in each quarter 
on a regional basis  north america  europe  and latin america revenues decreased  and  respectively  in over while asia pacific revenues increased during this same period 
north america revenues decreased as a result of decreased revenues in the communications segment  including decreases in voice and video communication product revenue and service revenue related to the ipower product line  and decreased revenues in the network systems segment 
europe revenues decreased as a result of decreased revenues in the communications segment partially offset by increased revenues in the network systems segment 
the decreased revenues in the communications segment were primarily a result of decreased revenue in the video communications product and service revenues related to the ipower product line partially offset by increased revenue in voice communication products 
latin america revenues decreased as a result of decreased revenues in the communications segment  including decreases in both voice and video communication product revenues  partially offset by increases in service revenues related to the ipower product 
the decreased revenues in the communications segment were partially offset by increased revenues in the network systems segment 
asia revenues increased as a result of increased revenues in the communications segment  including increases in both voice and video communication product revenues  partially offset by decreases in the service revenue related to ipower products  and increased revenues in the network systems segment 
no customer accounted for more than of our total net revenues or our communications segment revenues in  or in and  our network systems segment had two channel partners that  together  represented approximately and  respectively  of network systems segment revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any or all of these channel partners would have a material adverse affect on the net revenues of the segment as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
our business is subject to the risks arising from domestic and global economic conditions 
the domestic and global economic downturn in and global economic uncertainty and the continued downturn in technology spending in and the first half of  slowed overall spending to the point where industries delayed or reduced technology purchases 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we noted a greater decrease in revenue from products with higher average selling prices  such as our network systems products 
while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy in the second half of  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could have an adverse impact on if our channel partners delay or reduce orders for our products  we may fall short of our revenue expectations in  as we did in the second and third quarters of and the first quarter of further  if these conditions recur in  our business and financial performance would be negatively affected as they were in the first half of  and the second half of for example  in the first quarter of  these conditions resulted in sequentially weaker network systems product revenues compared to the fourth quarter of network systems revenue had another small sequential decrease in revenue in the second quarter of although there was some improvement in technology spending and the global economy in the second half of  the extent of any recurrence of any adverse economic conditions or uncertainty in technology spending in is difficult to predict at this time  which represents a significant uncertainty with respect to our operating results in in october  we launched a new video product offering  the vsx while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that the launch of this low end video product could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any video product until they determine if the vsx is a more desirable product than our existing video products or purchase this lower end video product instead of our higher end video products  including the viewstation ex and fx 
such delays in purchases or purchases of the vsx instead of our higher end video products  could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results 
in addition  weakness in the end user market for any of our products could negatively affect the revenue and cash flow of our channel partners who could  in turn  delay orders and delay paying their obligations to us 
this could harm our revenues  profitability  financial condition and cash flow 
in addition  we recently made significant changes in sales management and the sales organization 
these changes may result in further changes to our channel partner strategy which may result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with even more direct interaction between us and our direct end user customers 
these changes may cause additional disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
in addition  the acquisition of voyant adds a level of complexity to our operations and we may not obtain the revenue synergies we are anticipating as voyant has a revenue concentration with a few large customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenues 
in addition  the majority of voyant s orders are received in the last month of a quarter  typically the last few weeks of that quarter  thus the unpredictability of the receipt of these orders could negatively impact our future results 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of total net revenues for the foreseeable future  and we plan to continue our expansion in asia and europe 
international sales  however  are subject to certain inherent risks  including potential economic weakness in international markets  quarantines or other restrictions associated with a recurrence of sars  or other similar events  political instability  any adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  war or other hostilities  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  export license requirements  tariffs and taxes  other trade barriers  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country 
additionally  international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of net revenues in the future as we introduce new products since we expect to initially introduce these products in north america  and also  because of the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in our core european markets of france  germany and the united kingdom  our business could be harmed 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
additionally  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales have been denominated in us currency 
however  if our international sales were denominated in local currencies in the future  these transactions would be subject to currency fluctuation impacts which could adversely affect our financial results 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order therefore backlog has not been a good indicator of future net revenues 
net revenues for any particular quarter are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty 
as of december   we did end the quarter with million of order backlog as compared to million at december   principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency and our focus on operational efficiencies in the logistics area 
we believe that the current level of backlog  as a percent of net revenues  is potentially maximized as a result of established product lead times  therefore there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain and it is unlikely that we will grow this level of backlog in future quarters  which is dependent in part on the ability of our sales force to generate orders linearly throughout the quarter and our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing requirements accordingly 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders which in turn could negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline to more historical levels or to zero 
cost of net revenues year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands cost of net revenues pts pts cost of net revenues consists primarily of contract manufacturer costs  including material and direct labor  our manufacturing organization  tooling depreciation  warranty expense  freight expense  royalty payments and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
generally  our network systems segment has higher gross margin than our communications segment 
our service gross margins  which are included in both of our segments  are lower than our product gross margins 
overall  gross margins increased in as compared to as a result of more favorable margins in the communications segment partially offset by decreases in the gross margins of our network systems segment 
video and voice communications products margins were favorably impacted due to product mix  while service revenues gross margins declined as a result of relatively fixed costs on lower revenues 
network systems had a decrease in volume and a mix shift to lower margin systems 
overall  margins decreased over as a result of less favorable margins in the communications segment partially offset by increases in the gross margins of our network systems segment 
communications segment margins in decreased from in both voice and video communications products primarily as a result of product mix and service margins decreased as a result of the acquisition of picturetel 
network systems margins increased in over as a result of product mix 
forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks associated with maintaining our current gross margin levels 
for example  uncertainties surrounding revenue levels and related production level variances  competition  changes in technology  changes in product mix  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchased part variances  warranty costs and timing of sales over the next few quarters can cause our cost of net revenues percentage to vary significantly 
further  in we began including one year of service with some of our video products which has lowered our product gross margins  for those products  as a result of allocating a portion of our product revenue to deferred service revenue 
service gross margins however will be favorably impacted when the deferred revenue is recorded as revenue 
in the future  most  if not all  of our future products may also have one year of service included with the product  thereby potentially impacting product gross margins negatively  depending on the pricing model established 
additionally  our ipower products  voip products and other desktop products have a significantly higher cost of net revenue percentage than our network systems  viewstation and soundstation products 
accordingly  any significant revenue growth in our ipower  voip and other desktop products  or a decline in revenue associated with network systems  viewstation and soundstation products will have a negative effect on our cost of net revenues percentages 
also  we may reduce prices on our products in the future for competitive reasons  as a result of a difficult economy  or to stimulate demand  such as occurred in the first quarter of with certain soundstation products  which could increase our cost of net revenues percentage 
there is the risk that any of these potential price reductions would not offset competitive pressures or stimulate demand 
in addition  cost variances associated with the manufacturing ramp of new products  or the write off of initial inventory purchases due to product launch delays or the lack of market acceptance of our new products such as our vsx  ipower series  voiceplus bridging solution  voip telephony products  vtx  viewstation ex  mgc or any other new product under development could occur  which would increase our cost of net revenues percentage in any quarter 
in addition to the uncertainties listed above  cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenues may increase due to a change in our mix of distribution channels and the mix of international versus north american revenues 
we don t expect that the voyant acquisition will have a significant impact on our gross margins in sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pts pt sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
sales and marketing expenses are not allocated to our segments 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues in as compared to was due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time and increased marketing costs 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to the overall expansion of our marketing efforts  including the addition of a chief marketing officer  who subsequently left us at the end of the third quarter  and related staffing and increased allocations of facilities and infrastructure as a result of the increased headcount 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls we implemented in the second half of and the first half of due to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
the increase in absolute dollars in over was due primarily to the increase in headcount in our sales force and increased product sales driven largely by the picturetel acquisition in the fourth quarter of and to a lesser extent our focus on the public sector market 
as a result  we had increases in salaries  commissions and headcount related expenses  such as travel 
also contributing to the absolute dollar increase was our overall efforts to expand our marketing initiatives  including the addition of a chief marketing officer and related staffing  increased spending on promotional materials  trade shows  and outside consultants 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
due to the innovative nature of our products and the effect of competing with much larger companies with much greater resources  such as cisco and microsoft  we believe we will incur increased expenses  especially advertising  to expand the overall market for  drive market penetration of  and increase the adoption rate of our technology and products and to educate potential end users as to the desirability of these products over competing products 
we expect to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollar amounts as we expand north american and international markets  market new products and expand the public sector 
also the acquisition of voyant which  was closed in the first quarter of  will increase our sales and marketing expense 
research and development expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pts pts research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development expenses remained flat in absolute dollar amounts in compared to  as a result of cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of and the first half of due to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
increases in research and development expenses occurred for the network systems segment in as compared to the same period in the prior year  while research and development expenses decreased for the communications segment over the prior year 
the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenues in as compared to is primarily due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time 
we continue to make investments in improving our existing products  integrating all of our existing and acquired products and developing new products  many of which we launched in in  our network systems segment development expenditures accounted for the majority of the slight increase in absolute dollars over this increase was partially offset by decreases in our communications segment  primarily in video product development which accounted for the majority of the offset while voice product development expenditure decreases contributed to a lesser extent 
we are currently investing research and development resources to enhance and upgrade our polycom office suite of products  which encompasses products in both our segments 
these products include our viewstation  vsx  viavideo ii  ipower  gms  mgc  pcs  weboffice  pathnavigator  soundstation  voicestation and vortex 
we anticipate expending a greater proportion of our research and development expenses towards the development of our software and infrastructure products  included in the network systems segment  to enhance the integration and interoperability of our entire product suite 
in all periods presented  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred 
increases in research and development expenses occurred for all product lines in over the point increase in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenues in  reflected our continued investments in our existing products as well as additional investments in our ipower products  which were acquired through the picturetel acquisition  investments in integrating all of our existing and acquired products and developing new products which were launched in the first quarter of this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
in  our communications segment  principally our video product development expenditures accounted for the majority of the total increase due to the addition of the picturetel research and development team for the full year versus just part of the fourth quarter in  while voice product development expenditures and our network systems segment product development expenditures accounted for a lesser portion of the increase 
we believe that technological leadership is critical to our success and we are committed to continuing a high level of research and development to develop new technologies and combat competitive pressures 
also  continued investment in new product initiatives will require significant research and development spending 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the future  especially as a result of additional expenses for products resulting from the acquisition of voyant in the first quarter of voyant will be reflected in our network systems segment 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of net revenues pt pt general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  patent litigation costs and bad debt expense and are not allocated to our segments 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased percentage point in over and in over the increase as a percent of revenue in over the comparable prior year is primarily due to the decrease in revenues during that same period of time 
the increase in spending in absolute dollars in general and administrative expenses in over the prior year was primarily the result of higher costs associated with accrued bonuses  increased infrastructure costs and outside services  including increased costs associated with new regulatory requirements  patent litigation and increased insurance costs 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and recruiting relocation expense 
in  increases in salaries and related costs accounted for million of the increase  increased infrastructure costs accounted for million and outside services accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in bad debt expense and million decrease in recruiting relocation expense 
the remaining change related to numerous smaller items 
the increase in absolute dollars spending in general and administrative in over was primarily the result of higher costs associated with increased infrastructure costs  outside services  including increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in infrastructure costs accounted for million of the total increase  outside services accounted for million of the total increase  bad debt expense accounted for million of the total increase  with the remaining increase related to numerous smaller items 
this increase was partially offset by cost containment measures and expense controls implemented in the second half of due to the continued economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending 
significant charges due to uncollectability of our receivables or to costs associated with our patent litigation could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
future quarter general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to visibility of costs  timing of revenue and other factors 
we believe that our general and administrative expenses will likely continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts in the future primarily as a result of expansion of our administrative staff and costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements and our continued investments in international regions 
however  we do not believe that the acquisition of voyant will add significant costs to our general and administrative expense 
acquisition related costs we recorded charges to operations of million in  million in and million in for acquisition related costs 
the charges in primarily related to professional services costs to integrate and liquidate the international picturetel and accord legal entities and to begin the integration of our acquisition of voyant which closed in january for  the acquisition related charges related primarily to the acquisition of picturetel and consisted primarily of professional services costs to complete the integration of us and picturetel 
in  these costs were associated with the acquisitions of accord  circa  picturetel and aspi 
the costs consisted of million of restructuring charges related to facility closings and severance costs  million of asset impairment charges and million of other acquisition costs including outside financial advisory  legal  accounting and consulting services 
if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material acquisition expenses related to these transactions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchased in process research and development in and  we incurred charges totaling million and million  respectively  for in process research and development 
this research and development was acquired in as part of the acquisition of meetu 
com  inc and in as part of the acquisitions of picturetel  circa and aspi  and comprised million  million and million for each of these respective acquisitions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts allocated to purchased in process research and development were determined by management  after considering among other factors  the results of an independent appraisal based on established valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry and were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed for these in process research and development projects 
the cost approach  which uses the concept that replacement cost is an indicator of fair value  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the in process research and development acquired in the meetu transaction 
the cost approach is based on the premise that a prudent investor would pay no more for an asset than the cost to replace that asset with a new one 
replacement cost was based on total costs  net of the unrealized income tax deduction benefit  spent developing the in process technology from meetu s inception through the date the valuation was performed 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the markets  cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing the developed technology and in process research and development in the estimated net cash flows from the products are based upon estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development costs  sales and marketing costs and income taxes from such projects and were discounted at rates ranging from to percent in relation to the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
our efforts to develop the purchased in process research and development into commercially viable products principally relate to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the products can be produced to meet its design specifications including function  features and technical performance requirements 
it is reasonably possible that the development of this technology could fail because of either prohibitive cost  inability to perform the required efforts to complete the technology or other factors outside of our control such as a change in the market for the resulting developed products 
in addition  at such time that the project is completed it is reasonably possible that the completed products do not receive market acceptance or that we are unable to produce and market the product effectively 
if we acquire additional businesses in the future  we may incur material purchased in process research and development expenses related to such transactions the following are the values assigned to each acquired picturetel in process research and development project at the time of acquisition and the estimated completion percentages  expected technology lives and estimated time and costs to complete as of december  in thousands in process research and development project value assigned to in process project percentage complete expected life of technology estimated time to complete estimated cost to complete project a  years complete project b  years complete project c  years terminated other projects  years months total during  we completed and shipped products associated with projects a  b and two of the other projects 
the costs to complete these projects were consistent with our expectations 
we terminated one of the other projects in during  we terminated project c and scaled back the scope of one of the other projects 
amortization of purchased intangibles in  and  we recorded million  million and million in amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions  respectively 
purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of three years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  purchased intangibles no longer meeting the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill must be reclassified to goodwill  and purchased intangibles deemed to have indefinite lives must no longer be amortized 
in the first quarter of  we reclassified approximately million of unamortized acquired workforce recorded as part of the purchase price allocation of the circa acquisition as it did not meet the criteria to be recorded separately from goodwill 
this resulted in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through the first quarter of also under sfas  intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
as a result  we determined that a previously recorded trade name intangible has an indefinite life 
consequently  the trade name intangible is no longer amortized  resulting in a permanent reduction in amortization expense of  per quarter through april in june  we completed the transitional purchased intangible impairment test outlined under sfas which required the assessment of purchased intangibles for impairment as of january   and in october and during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during or amortization of goodwill in the year ended december   we recorded million of amortization of goodwill related to the circa acquisition 
beginning january   under sfas  we no longer amortize goodwill related to the circa acquisition 
this resulted in a permanent decrease in goodwill amortization expense of approximately million per quarter through the first quarter of under the transition rules of sfas  business combinations completed after july   but prior to january   were accounted for in accordance with sfas  and consequently  goodwill balances from the picturetel  aspi and meetu acquisitions have never been amortized 
in june  we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test outlined under sfas which required the assessment of goodwill for impairment as of january   and in october and the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests 
all of these tests were conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets were not impaired as of january  or during or we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
restructure costs in  we approved restructuring actions in response to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending and to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
this charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately six percent of our employees worldwide 
as of december   we had paid all of this charge 
in the first and second quarters of  we approved additional restructuring actions primarily in connection with the sale of the network access product line to verilink and in response to the global economic uncertainty and continued downturn in technology spending 
these actions were meant to improve our overall cost structure by prioritizing resources in strategic areas of the business and reducing operating expenses 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in as a result of these actions 
the charge consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately percent of our employees worldwide 
the restructuring charge related to the network systems and communications segments amounted to million and million  respectively 
the balance of the restructuring charge related to operating activities which are separately managed at the corporate level and not allocated to segments 
as of december   we had paid approximately million of the million charge 
the remaining amount is to be paid by the end of the second quarter of and is recorded in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we expect that  due to these restructuring actions  operating expenses in absolute dollars will grow at a much smaller rate than what otherwise would have been  as the headcount affected by the restructuring will be added back over time as our operations expand in connection with the growth of our business 
if the economic downturn and uncertainty in technology spending recurs in  we may take additional restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions our business could be harmed 
litigation settlement during the first quarter of  we reached a settlement with a former picturetel customer 
the dispute involved certain services provided by picturetel in and amounts owed to us for providing these services 
the amount received was net of legal fees incurred to litigate and settle the case 
interest income  net interest income  net consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts and imputed interest expense related to the present value of costs associated with closing facilities as part of the picturetel acquisition and related integration plan 
imputed interest expense was million for  million for and  for interest income  net of interest expense  was million in  million in and million in interest income decreased in over due primarily to interest rate reductions resulting from the monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
partially offsetting this negative effect was an increase in our average cash and investment balances which was primarily due to cash generated from operations 
average interest rate returns on our cash and investments were in compared to in interest income decreased in over the due primarily to the imputed interest expense related to facility closings and interest rate reductions resulting from the monetary policy actions taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states during and partially offsetting these negative effects was an increase in our average cash and investment balances  which was due primarily to our common stock offering which raised million in the first quarter of the average interest rate return on our cash and cash equivalents was and on our investments was in compared to and  respectively  for interest income  net could fluctuate for due to movement in our cash balances and changes in interest rates related to monetary policy actions  if any  taken by the united states federal reserve board to stimulate economic growth in the united states 
loss on strategic investments for strategic reasons we have made various investments in private companies  and in limited circumstances  public companies 
the private company investments are carried at cost less any impairment write downs and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist  and make appropriate reductions in carrying value  if necessary 
at december   these investments had no carrying value 
we made additional investments of million in two private companies in which had a carrying value of million as of december  our aggregate investments have been permanently written down a total of million from original cost  including million in  million in and million in which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the public company investments are recorded in short term investments and long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets and are marked to market each period through unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity  except our warrants to purchase publicly traded equity securities which are marked to market through the statement of operations 
realized gains and losses on these strategic investments in public company investments are reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded losses totaling million in  million in and million in related to the sale of our strategic investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies  impairment of equity securities of publicly traded companies and the write down of warrants to purchase publicly traded equity securities 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes  including taxes related to discontinued operations  was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in over was primarily attributable to a decrease in worldwide profit before taxes 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in over was primarily attributable to a decrease in nondeductible acquisition related costs and an increase in foreign earnings subject to relatively lower tax rates 
as of december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards  million in tax credit carryovers and million in capital loss carryforwards as well as other deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
short term and long term investments consisted primarily of us government securities  state and local government securities and corporate debt and equity securities of which million was invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have a million line of credit with a bank which was unused at december   however we do have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million which are secured by this line of credit 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to decreases in deferred taxes  increases in other accrued liabilities  and increases in accounts payable 
offsetting these positive effects were smaller net income  smaller non cash expenses  larger increases in prepaids and other assets  smaller decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and smaller increases in taxes payable 
the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to larger decreases in trade receivables  larger increases in taxes payable and a smaller increase in prepaids and other current assets offset partially by smaller reductions in inventories  increases in deferred taxes and larger decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities over the comparable period 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million of net purchases of investments  million for purchases of property and equipment  million for the repurchase of common stock  million for purchase of licensed technology and million for purchase of a convertible note receivable 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million from proceeds from sale of discontinued operations 
the positive cash from operating activities was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  the provision for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs for excess and obsolescence  gain from sales of discontinued operations  amortization of unearned stock based compensation  loss on strategic investments and the tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock options  reductions in trade receivables  inventories and deferred taxes and net increases in accounts payable  taxes payable and other accrued liabilities 
offsetting the positive effect of these items were net increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
over the past several quarters  our days sales outstanding  or dso  metrics have improved significantly 
the company reduced dsos from days at december  to days at december  there is no assurance that the current level of dso will be maintained and in all likelihood dso metrics will increase as revenues increase or as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity 
in addition  inventory turns at december  had increased significantly 
inventory turns improved from turns at december  to turns at december  the positive cash impact due to net trade receivables and inventory reductions will likely not recur in as it did in and on january   we completed our acquisition of voyant technologies  inc  or voyant 
see recent developments in item above for further information 
we paid million in cash to the voyant shareholders in connection with this acquisition 
approximately million of the cash was placed into escrow to be held as security for losses incurred by us in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties covered in the merger agreement or certain other events 
voyant shareholders may receive an additional million of consideration over a two year period  payable in cash or  at our option  in polycom stock  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones relating to the sale of voyant products 
voyant s results of operations are not included in our results of operations presented below as the acquisition was completed subsequent to december  in february  we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock  including an over allotment option of  shares exercised by the underwriters  at a price of per share 
our net proceeds from this offering were approximately million after taking into account underwriting discounts and commissions and our expenses 
we have used the net proceeds from this sale primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  as well as for acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
in june  the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately  shares in the open market  for cash of million 
during  we retired and reclassified these shares of common stock as authorized and unissued 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  additional shares  in the open market  for cash of million  which have been retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued 
we may continue to repurchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional approximately million shares under the june repurchase plan 
in  we may continue to repurchase shares under our current board authorization and may seek and obtain approval from our board of directors for an additional amount of shares to repurchase 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
in november  we entered into a lease amendment for one of our facilities in andover  massachusetts  for which we had previously provided a restructuring reserve 
the original term of this lease  which ended in  was amended to allow us to exit approximately one third of the space in this facility which is currently unoccupied in november for a cash payment of million  to exit an additional approximately one third of the space which is currently unoccupied in november for an additional cash payment of million  and to allow us the option of exiting the remaining one third of the building in november which is currently occupied 
the amendment also gives the landlord the right  until november to require us to exit the occupied space with six months notice 
if we  either voluntarily  or as required by the landlord  exit the occupied space  we will make a final million payment to the landlord and we would begin to amortize our remaining leasehold improvements net book value of million at december  over six months 
the lease agreement was also amended to allow the landlord to sublet the unoccupied space earlier than november and november if the landlord is successful in releasing us from the space earlier than the amendment provides  we would make the related cash payments noted above and additional cash payments pertaining to fifty percent of the cash savings related to us no longer having to pay rent and common area maintenance charges on that portion of the building 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit to secure the leases on some of our offices 
these letters of credit total approximately million and are secured by our credit facilities or cash deposits with our banks 
as of december   the following future minimum lease payments under our current lease obligations are shown net of estimated sublease income 
for example  we have an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for which the sublease runs concurrent with our lease obligation 
as a result we are not currently showing a lease obligation related to this facility 
if this sublease were to be terminated  or if the tenant defaulted on payment  we would incur additional lease payments that would negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
this table also shows other contractual obligations as of december  other long term liabilities purchase commitments minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs year ending december  thereafter total payments we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  investments and bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  competitive reasons or to continue the availability of components or product from sole source suppliers  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by internal audit and the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize hardware product revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists and eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize software revenue in accordance with the aicpa statement of position no 
 or sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under these guidelines  we defer revenue recognition on transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement does not exist  title has not transferred  product payment is contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is not fixed or determinable or payment is not reasonably assured 
in addition  we estimate what future product returns may occur based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenues by these estimated future returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  these estimates could be revised 
in addition  we defer revenue associated with long term customer maintenance contracts 
revenue on these contracts is recognized ratably over the length of the customer contract 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  trade in credits  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline further  we may take actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of hardware and software product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers or channel partners were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  as was the case with global crossing and worldcom in and mcsi in  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
in order to fully utilize these deferred tax assets we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets and therefore  as of december   we have not established a valuation allowance against these assets 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in purchase combinations the purchase combinations completed require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in the combinations 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plan for the entities acquired including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations assumed for which no future benefit will be received 
for example  in the picturetel acquisition  we identified vacated or redundant facilities that we intended to sublease or negotiate a lease termination settlement 
for all material acquisitions the allocation period  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has been completed 
therefore  if actual costs exceed our estimates these charges would be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
if actual costs are less than our estimates  these charges would continue to be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangibles we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would typically measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we accounted for the picturetel  aspi and meetu acquisitions  all of which were completed after july   under the new guidance  and on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from the circa acquisition which was completed prior to july  in june  we completed our transitional goodwill and purchased intangibles impairment tests outlined under sfas which required the assessment of goodwill and purchased intangibles for impairment as of january  and in the fourth quarter of and  we completed our annual impairment tests 
the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units  as defined in sfas  to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets and purchased intangible assets were not impaired as of january  or during or we plan to conduct our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of every year  unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
non marketable securities we periodically make strategic investments  or have acquired these investments through business acquisitions  in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
these investments had a carrying value of million as of december   and have been permanently written down by a total of million from original cost

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin were originally to be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  in september  the fasb deferred the adoption of fin for variable interest entities acquired prior to february  until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have any effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
other factors affecting future operations investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any or all of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are not a good indicator of future performance 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are out of our control 
these factors include market acceptance and transition of new product introductions  including the vsx  other new products launched in  new products launched in the future  and product enhancements by us or our competitors  difficult general economic conditions  as has been the case with the recent global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  and specific economic conditions prevailing in the communications industry and other technology industries  the prices and performance of our products and those of our competitors  further changes to our channel partner contracts and channel partner strategy  including changes to our channel partner contracts in north america which has led to  a change in the number and mix of channel partners  which has resulted in a smaller number of channel partners and to some of our channel partners adding our competitors products to their portfolio and could lead to more doing so  changes to our channel partner contracts in europe  asia and latin america which could lead to a change in the number and mix of channel partners  to a smaller number of channel partners and could lead to the same channel upset already experienced in north america  recent changes in our sales management and sales organization which could result in disruptions among our channel partners  the timing and size of the orders for our products  our distribution channels reducing their inventory levels  slowing sales by our channel partners to their customers which places further pressure on our channel partners to minimize inventory levels and reduce purchases of our products  the level and mix of inventory that we hold to meet future demand  the near and long term impact of the military action in iraq or other hostilities  the near and long term impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response or uncertainty regarding any military response to those attacks  the impact of the unstable political situation in israel and military action by the israeli government and other hostilities in the middle east and their impact on our israeli operations  the shift in sales mix of products we sell to lower margin products  the shift in revenues to upgrade revenues as opposed to full systems in our network systems segment  which could lead to lower revenues  fluctuations in the level of international sales and our exposure to international currency fluctuations in both revenues and expenses  the cost and availability of components  manufacturing costs  the level and cost of warranty claims  the impact of disruptions at the sites of our primary manufacturing partners in thailand  china  singapore and israel or raw material suppliers to these primary manufacturing partners  for any reason  including the recurrence of sars or other similar event  the impact of disruptions in our operations  for any reason  including the recurrence of sars or other similar event  the impact of seasonality on our various product lines and geographic regions  the introduction of web collaboration solutions that compete with our web collaboration or video solutions  adverse outcomes to intellectual property claims particularly the collaboration properties  inc litigation  and the level of royalties we must pay to third parties 
we experienced sequential quarterly revenue growth from through since that time we have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to these or other factors 
these and other factors could further prevent us from attaining or sustaining sequential quarterly growth or meeting our expectations regarding our operating results  and investors should not use our past results to predict future operating margins and results 
for example  although we experienced sequential quarterly revenue increases in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to increases in our video and network systems product revenues  we experienced sequential quarterly revenue decreases in the first quarter of  and the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily related to declines in our combined video communications and network systems product revenue 
in addition  we incurred a significant net loss in due to charges related to acquisitions completed in that year  as well as a net loss in the first quarter of as a result of these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not a good predictor of our future performance 
if our future operating results are below the expectations of stock market securities analysts or investors  our stock price will likely decline 
we face risks associated with our products and product development  including new product introductions and transitions 
our success depends on our ability to assimilate new technologies in our products and to properly train our channel partners in the use of those products 
the markets for video and voice communications and network systems products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
the success of our new products depends on several factors  including proper new product definition  product cost  timely completion and introduction of new products  proper positioning of new products in relation to our total product portfolio and their relative pricing  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 
additionally  properly addressing the complexities associated with compatibility issues  channel partner training  technical and sales support as well as field support are also factors that may affect our success in this market 
when we take any significant actions regarding our product offerings  or acquire new product offerings  it is important to educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion as to the desirability of the new product offering compared to our existing product offerings 
in october  we launched a new video product offering  the vsx while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that the launch of this low end video product could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any video product until they determine if the vsx is a more desirable product than our existing video products or purchase this lower end video product instead of our higher end video products  including the viewstation ex and fx 
such delays in purchases or purchases of the vsx instead of our higher end video products  could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay 
in addition  in we launched new voice  video and network systems products 
these new product launches  or any new product launch in the future  could also cause confusion amongst our channel partners as we educate and train them on  and as they take time to evaluate  these new product offerings 
further  the shift in communications from circuit switched to ip based technologies over time may require us to add new channel partners  enter new markets  such as the service provider market  and gain new core technological competencies 
we are attempting to address these needs  including developing a service provider strategy  and the need to develop new products through our internal development efforts  joint developments with other companies and through acquisitions 
we may not identify successful new product opportunities and develop and bring products to market in a timely manner or be successful in developing a service provider strategy 
additionally  we cannot assure you that competing technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
further  as we introduce new products that can or will obsolete existing products  these product transition cycles may not go smoothly  causing an increased risk of inventory obsolescence and relationship issues with our channel partners 
the failure of our new product development efforts  any inability to service or maintain the necessary third party interoperability licenses  our inability to properly manage product transition and our inability to enter new markets  such as the service provider market  would harm our business and results of operations 
we may experience delays in product introductions and our products may contain defects which could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation and seriously harm our results of operations 
we intend to continue to introduce new products  such as our vsx  visual concert products  via video ii  soundsation vtx  viewstation ex  mgc  vortex ef  pathnavigator  pcs and weboffice products 
however  we cannot assure you that new product releases will be timely or that they will be made at all 
for example  the viewstation fx and viavideo were delayed from their original release dates which we believe negatively affected our net revenues in the vsx was also delayed from its original release date 
our video communications product development group is located in massachusetts and texas  our voice communications product development group is dispersed among california  georgia and canada and our network systems product development group is dispersed among colorado  georgia and israel 
therefore  we may experience product delays in the future  due to communications  logistics or other issues involved in coordinating a large geographically separated product development group 
in the past  we have experienced other delays in the introduction of certain new products and enhancements  and we believe that such delays may occur in the future 
for instance  we experienced delays in introducing the vsx  viewstation mp and webstation from their original expected release dates due to unforeseen technology and or manufacturing ramping issues 
similar delays occurred during the introduction of the showstation  showstation ip and soundstation premier which affected the first customer ship dates of these products 
we also had delays in introducing our soundstation ip product which we believe negatively impacted our sales revenue in the first quarter of further  our soundpoint ip product introduction was delayed which we believe negatively impacted our sales in the third and fourth quarters of any similar delays in the future for other new product offerings currently under development could adversely affect market acceptance for these products and our reputation  and seriously harm our results of operations 
we face risks related to the adoption rate of new technologies 
we have invested significant resources developing products that are dependent on the adoption rate of new technologies 
for example  our soundstation ip and soundpoint ip products are dependent on the roll out of voice over ip  or voip  technologies 
in addition  voip products are traditionally sold through service providers 
our strategy surrounding selling our voip products and developing our service provider network is just being initiated and there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in developing such a strategy or establishing a successful service provider network 
the success of our viavideo ii product depends on the increased use of desktop video collaboration technologies 
the success of our weboffice product is dependent on the increased use and acceptance of web collaboration technologies in concert with audio and video conferencing 
the success of all of our products is also dependent on how quickly sip is deployed as a new technology standard and how quickly we adopt and integrate this new standard into our existing and future products 
if the use of new technologies that our current and future products are based on does not occur  or the development of suitable sales channels does not occur  or occurs more slowly than expected  we may not be able to sell certain of our products in significant volumes and our business may be harmed 
lower than expected market acceptance of our products  price competition and other price decreases would negatively impact our business 
if the market does not accept our products  including the new products launched in  our profitability could be harmed 
our profitability could also be negatively affected in the future as a result of continuing competitive price pressures in the sale of video and voice conferencing equipment and network systems which could cause us to reduce the prices for any of these products or discontinue one product with the intent of simplifying our product offering and enhancing sales of a similar product 
further  we have reduced prices in the past in order to expand the market for our products  and in the future  we may further reduce prices  introduce new products that carry lower margins in order to expand the market or stimulate demand for our products  or discontinue existing products in the hope of stimulating growth in a similar product 
while we cannot assure you that these actions would have the desired result  any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our product margins and profitability 
product obsolescence  excess inventory and other asset impairment can negatively affect our results of operations 
we operate in a high technology industry which is subject to rapid and frequent technology and market demand changes 
these changes can often render existing or developing technologies obsolete 
in addition  the introduction of new products and any related actions to discontinue existing products can cause existing inventory to become obsolete 
these obsolescence issues can require write downs in inventory value when it is determined that the recorded value of existing inventory is greater than its fair market value 
for example  this situation occurred in the third quarter of as we wrote down inventories of a product in development as a result of a delay in the product introduction 
also  our viewstation product and ipower products offer certain comparable functionality and may compete with each other for customers 
in addition  we launched several new products in if sales of one of these products have a negative effect on sales of another of our products  it could significantly increase the inventory levels of the negatively impacted product 
the potential for new products to render existing products obsolete  cause inventories of existing products to increase  cause us to discontinue a product or reduce the demand for existing products exists for every one of our products 
we purchased several businesses in and which included goodwill valued at approximately million and other purchased intangible assets valued at approximately million as of december  this represents a significant portion of our recorded assets 
generally accepted accounting principles related to goodwill and other intangibles changed with the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets which we adopted effective january  under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must be reviewed for impairment at least annually or sooner under certain circumstances 
other intangible assets that are deemed to have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but must be reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist  or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  we cannot assure you that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill impairment tests 
if impairment is deemed to exist  we would write down the recorded value of these intangible assets to their fair values which could result in a full write off of their book value 
if these write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we have made investments in private companies which we classify as other assets in our balance sheets 
the value of these investments is influenced by many factors  including the operating effectiveness of these companies  the overall health of these companies industries  the strength of the private equity markets and general market conditions 
due to these and other factors  we have recorded charges against earnings totaling million from fiscal through associated with the impairment of these investments  which has been reflected in loss on strategic investments in the statements of operations 
as of december   our investments in private companies are valued at million 
we may make additional investments in private companies which would be subject to similar impairment risks  and these impairment risks may cause us to write down the recorded value of any such investments 
further  we cannot assure you that future inventory  investment  license  fixed asset or other asset write downs will not happen 
if future write downs do occur  they could harm our business and results of operations 
failure to adequately service and support our products could harm our results of operations 
our recent growth has been due in large part to an expansion into products with more complex technologies  including our network systems products  new video product offerings and our software products 
this has increased the need for product warranty and service capabilities 
if we cannot develop and train our internal support organization or maintain our relationship with our outside technical support provider  it could harm our business 
in addition  we are including service support with the recent launch of the vsx product 
we view this service offering  and other service offerings  to be a key success factor in our business 
we are currently reorganizing our service organization to  among other things  more fully integrate the service businesses of our recent acquisitions 
as part of this effort  we are also implementing a new customer relationship management system  which we expect to provide better information for us to provide improved customer support 
if we do not manage this difficult reorganization properly  we could alienate our customers or channel partners which could harm our business and results of operations 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions which can result in reductions in capital expenditures by end user customers for our products  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased competition 
these factors adversely impacted our operating results in  where we experienced a sequential revenue decrease in each of the first two quarters 
we also experienced sequential revenue decreases in the second  third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of due in part to these factors 
while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could have an adverse impact on in addition  in the first quarter of  we noted a greater decrease in revenue from products with higher average selling prices  such as our network systems products  which we believe resulted from adverse economic conditions 
we implemented restructuring actions in and the first and second quarters of to reduce our overall cost structure 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million in and million in these charges consisted of severance and other employee termination benefits related to workforce reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions our business could be harmed 
in addition  these restructuring actions may not be sufficient and additional actions may need to be taken in the future 
in addition  we also face the risk that some of our channel partners have inventory levels in excess of future anticipated sales growth 
if such sales growth does not occur in the time frame anticipated by these channel partners for any reason  including a recurrence in of the recent global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  these channel partners may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods  or product returns may exceed historical or predicted levels which would harm our business 
for example  our channel partners reduced their inventory levels during in anticipation of lower end user demand 
also  in and  we began to implement a new direct touch strategy in concert with a realignment of our channel partner strategy 
this strategy enables us to have more direct interaction with our end user customers 
this strategy shift includes channel certifications for certain network systems and video products that we believe will yield a higher level of end user customer satisfaction 
as part of this new channel partner strategy and a result of the recent economic downturn  the channel inventory model has changed to reduce channel inventories at those channel partners that stock product and to move some channel partners to a drop shipment method for their end user customers as opposed to having these partners carry inventory 
during the second quarter of  we believe that we essentially completed our channel inventory reduction program and we believe that  in aggregate  we will see only minor variations  upwards or downwards  in channel inventory weeks within product lines or regions moving forward 
during the third and fourth quarters of and the first half of we believe our channel partners video and voice inventory decreased over the respective prior periods 
in the third quarter of  channel inventories remained stable 
voice channel inventories decreased in the fourth quarter of  although we did see a slight increase in video channel inventories  primarily as a result of advance purchases of video inventory related to some specific end user opportunities in the first quarter of in the asia pacific region 
the decrease in channel inventories in the last half of was due largely to this shift in channel partner strategy resulting in us shipping fewer video and voice units to channel partners in the third and fourth quarter of and our channel partners lowering inventory levels as a result of lower end user demand 
in the first and second quarters of  we believe that sales of our products by our channel partners to end user customers exceeded the number of units that we shipped to the channel as a result of increased end user demand  thereby decreasing overall inventory at our channel partners 
the decreased channel inventory levels had less impact on sales of ipower video units and products in our network systems segment  which are not typically carried in inventory by our channel partners 
in fact  sales of our network systems products for the third and fourth quarters of increased sequentially  in each quarter 
if we fail to compete successfully  our business and results of operations would be significantly harmed 
we face significant competition in the communications industry which is subject to rapid technological change 
in video communications  our major competitors include tandberg and a number of other companies including aethra  clearone communications  huawei  nec  panasonic  philips  sony  vcon and vtel  as well as various smaller or new industry entrants 
some of these companies have substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
in addition  with advances in telecommunications standards  connectivity and video processing technology and the increasing market acceptance of video communications  other established or new companies may develop or market products competitive with our video communications products or may partner with companies which have more substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market or sell their products 
for example  cisco systems recently announced a strategic relationship with tandberg  our major competitor in the video communications market 
we believe we will face increasing competition from alternative video communications solutions that employ new technologies or new combinations of technologies from companies such as cisco systems  com  hewlett packard  dell  microsoft  nortel networks  realnetworks and webex  that enable web based or network based video and collaboration communications 
the market for voice communications equipment  including voice conferencing and desktop equipment  is highly competitive and also subject to rapid technological change  regulatory developments and emerging industry standards 
we expect competition to persist and increase in the future in this area 
in voice communications  our major competitors include aethra  clearone communications  konftel  mitel  soundgear and other companies that offer lower cost  full duplex speakerphones 
in the voip desktop space  there are several low cost manufacturers in asia and europe that are emerging 
in addition  there are notable pbx and ip call manager manufacturers that compete in the standards based ip space including avaya  cisco  mitel and siemens 
furthermore  all major telephony manufacturers produce hands free speakerphone units that are lower cost than our voice communications products 
our network systems business has significant competition from radvision  and a number of other companies  including avaya  cisco systems  first virtual  huawei and tandberg 
in addition  it is possible that we will see increased competition in all of our product lines to the extent that one or more of our competitors join together either through mutual agreement or acquisitions to form new partnerships to compete against us 
these competitors on a stand alone basis or on a combined basis could have more substantial financial resources and production  marketing  engineering and other capabilities with which to develop  manufacture  market and sell their products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved performance characteristics 
new product introductions by our competitors could cause a significant decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing products and future products 
we believe that the possible effects from ongoing competition may be the reduction in the prices of our products and our competitors products  the introduction of additional lower priced competitive products or the introduction of new products or product platforms that render our existing products or technologies obsolete 
we expect this increased competitive pressure may lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices and gross margins which would significantly harm our results of operations 
because a disproportionate amount of our sales occur at the end of a quarter  our operating results are unpredictable 
the timing of our channel partner orders and product shipments can harm our operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results depend upon the volume and timing of channel partner orders received during a given quarter and the percentage of each order that we are able to ship and recognize as revenue during each quarter  each of which is extremely difficult to forecast 
moreover  the majority of our orders in a given quarter historically have been shipped in the last month of that quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of the quarter 
in  we did end the third and fourth quarters with a more significant amount of order backlog than our historical experience  principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency and our focus on operational officiencies in the logistics area 
we believe that the current level of backlog  as a percent of current quarters net revenues  is potentially maximized as a result of established product lead times  therefore there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain and it is unlikely that we will grow this level of backlog in future quarters  which is dependent in part on the ability of our sales force to generate orders linearly throughout the quarter and our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could significantly negatively impact end user orders which could in turn negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
as a result  our backlog could decline to more historical levels or even to zero 
the return to historical linearity levels or any failure or delay in the closing of orders during the last part of a quarter would materially harm our operating results  as occurred in the first quarter of and the second and third quarters of furthermore  we may be unable to ship products in the period we receive the order  due to these or other factors  which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
in such events  the price of our common stock would decline 
difficulty in estimating channel partner orders can harm our operating results  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency and our focus on operations efficiency in the logistics area 
net revenues for any particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict  with any degree of certainty 
we typically ship products within a short time after we receive an order and therefore  backlog is not a good indicator of future net revenues 
in  we did end the third and fourth quarters with a more significant amount of order backlog than our historical experience  principally as a result of our new channel strategy  the establishment of product lead times to maximize our inventory efficiency and our focus on operational officiencies in the logistics area 
there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain and it is unlikely that we will grow this level of backlog in future quarters  which is dependent in part on the ability of our sales force to generate orders linearly throughout the quarter and our ability to forecast revenue mix and plan our manufacturing accordingly 
in addition  orders from our channel partners are based on the level of demand from end user customers 
any decline or uncertainty in end user demand could negatively impact end user orders which could in turn significantly negatively affect orders from our channel partners in any given quarter 
accordingly  our expectations for both short and long term future net revenues are based almost exclusively on our own estimate of future demand and not on firm channel partner orders 
our expense levels are based largely on these estimates 
because we historically have received a majority of our channel partner orders in the last month of a quarter and often in the last few weeks of the quarter  we are limited in our ability to reduce expenses quickly if for any reason orders and net revenues do not meet our expectations in a particular period 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in demand for our products in relation to our expectations would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we face risks related to our dependence on channel partners to sell our products 
we are subject to risks associated with our channel partners product inventories and product sell through 
we sell a significant amount of our products to channel partners who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
if these channel partners are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if channel partners decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as a recurrence of the recent global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending  the volume of our sales to these channel partners and our net revenues would be negatively affected 
for example  the economic downturn negatively affected our business and operating results in  and the global economic uncertainty and downturn in technology spending negatively affected our business and operating results in and the first quarter of while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and if these conditions recur in the future  our business and operating results will continue to be negatively affected 
in addition  if channel partners decide to purchase more inventory  due to product availability or other reasons  than is required to satisfy end user demand or if end user demand does not keep pace with the additional inventory purchases  channel inventory could grow in any particular quarter which could adversely affect product revenues in the subsequent quarter 
moreover  if we choose to eliminate or reduce special cost or stocking incentive programs  quarterly revenues may fail to meet our expectations or be lower than historical levels 
in addition  as a result of changes in sales management and our sales organization  we have implemented changes to our partner strategy in north america and plan to continue to implement changes  internationally to our channel partner strategy and contracts which may continue to result in a smaller number of channel partners  a change in the mix of our channel partners and a shift to a model with even more direct interaction between us and our direct end user customers 
in addition  this channel strategy has and could continue to upset our channel partners to the extent that they could add competitive products to their portfolios or shift more emphasis to selling our competitors products 
these changes may continue to cause disruptions in our channels and negatively impact revenue growth in the near term 
our revenue estimates are based largely on end user sales reports that our channel partners provide to us on a monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate 
to the extent that this sales out and channel inventory data is inaccurate  we may not be able to make revenue estimates for future periods 
we are subject to risks associated with the success of the businesses of our channel partners 
many of our channel partners that carry multiple polycom products  and from whom we derive significant revenues  are undercapitalized 
the failure of these businesses to establish and sustain profitability or obtain financing could have a significant negative effect on our future revenue levels and profitability and our ability to collect our receivables 
further  while there has been some improvement in technology spending and the global economy  constraints in technology capital spending still exist and could cause more of our channel partners businesses to suffer or fail  which would harm our business 
our business has been harmed and could be harmed further if our large channel partners continue to be affected by the recurrence of global economic uncertainty and a downturn in technology spending 
for example  we have experienced a decline in revenues from worldcom  global crossing and mcsi due to their financial troubles 
this drop in the amount of orders we have received from these three channel partners negatively affected our revenues and profitability in the past 
to avoid confusion among our channel partners regarding our product offerings  we need to devote significant resources to educating and training them 
when we take any significant actions regarding our product offerings  or acquire new product offerings  it is important to educate and train our channel partners to avoid any confusion on the desirability of the new product offering in relation to our existing product offerings 
in october  we launched a new video product offering  the vsx while we believe we have taken the appropriate measures to educate and train our channel partners  there is a risk that the launch of this low end video product could cause confusion among our channel partners and end users  thereby causing them to delay purchases of any video product  such as the viewstation ex and fx  until they determine if the vsx is a more desirable product than our existing video products 
such delays in purchases could adversely affect our net revenues  gross margins and operating results in the period of the delay 
in addition  in we launched new voice  video and network systems products 
these new product launches  or any new product launch in the future  could cause confusion amongst our channel partners as we educate and train them on  and as they take time to evaluate  these new product offerings 
integrating picturetel s product offerings with ours has created confusion among our channel partners 
we will need to continue to devote significant resources to educate and train our channel partners about our combined product offerings 
channel confusion could also occur if we do not adequately train or educate the channel on our product families especially in the cases where we simplify our product offerings by discontinuing one product in order to stimulate growth of a similar product 
ongoing confusion may lead to delays in ordering our products which would negatively affect our revenues 
conflicts with our channel partners could hurt sales of our products 
we have various oem agreements with major telecommunications equipment manufacturers  such as avaya  cisco systems and nortel networks  whereby we manufacture our products to work with the equipment of the oem 
these relationships can create conflicts with our other channel partners who directly compete with our oem partners  or could create conflicts among our oem partners who compete with each other  which could adversely affect revenues from these other channel partners or our oem partners 
conflicts among our oem partners could also make partnering with these oem partners increasingly difficult 
because many of our channel partners also sell equipment that competes with our products  these channel partners could devote more attention to these other products which could harm our business 
for example  a significant amount of our network systems revenues in were generated from sales to tandberg  sony and vcon  which compete with us in the video communications product market 
we believe that because of this conflict  they significantly reduced their orders of our network systems products in and  which has impacted our sales of this product line 
further  other channel conflicts could arise which cause channel partners to devote resources to other non polycom communications equipment which would negatively affect our business or results of operations 
some of our current and future products are directly competitive with the products of our channel and strategic partners 
for example  we have an agreement with cisco systems under which we ship soundstation ip conference phones for resale by cisco systems 
in addition  cisco sells a network systems product which is in direct competition with our network systems offerings and has just announced a partnership with tandberg  one of our major competitors in the video communications business 
as a consequence of conflicts such as these  there is the potential for our channel and strategic partners to significantly reduce their orders of our products or design our technology out of their products 
in addition  competition with our partners in all of the markets in which we operate is likely to increase  potentially resulting in strains on our existing relationships with these companies 
any such strain could limit the potential contribution of our strategic relationships to our business  restrict our ability to form strategic relationships with these companies in the future and create additional competitive pressures on us  including downward pressure on our average selling prices which would result in a decrease in both revenues and gross margins  any of which could harm our business 
our channel partner contracts are typically short term and early termination of these contracts may harm our results of operations 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our channel partners  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our channel partners 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the channel partner 
in the event of an early termination by or loss of one of our major channel partners  we believe that the end user customer would likely purchase from another one of our channel partners 
if this did not occur and we were unable to rapidly replace that revenue source its loss would harm our results of operations 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenues 
sales of some of our products have experienced seasonal fluctuations which have affected sequential growth rates for these products  particularly in our third and first quarters 
for example  there is generally a slowdown for sales of our products in the european region in the third quarter of each year and sales to government entities typically slow in our fourth quarter and to a greater extent in our first quarter 
in addition  sales of our video communications products have typically declined in the first quarter of the year compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
seasonal fluctuations could negatively affect our business  which could cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated results for such quarters  as they did in the first quarter of difficulties we may encounter managing a substantially larger business could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our officers and key personnel have worked together for only a short period of time or have only recently joined us 
some of our officers and key personnel have worked together for only a short period of time 
in addition  some of our executive officers have recently assumed significant new responsibilities 
for example  in the first quarter of  we hired a new senior vice president and general manager  video communications  and a new senior vice president  worldwide sales  and reorganized our sales force and our video communications division 
the sales force reorganization has resulted in the hiring of a significant amount of new senior sales management  including a new focus on government sales  and the movement of other senior sales management to new roles and responsibilities  including the promotion of one individual to the role of general manager of asia pacific 
these new management changes could disrupt our sales  which in turn could result in reduced sales  confusion with our channel partners  and delayed introduction of new or upgraded products 
the failure to successfully integrate new senior management could divert management s attention from other ongoing business concerns 
if we fail to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will be harmed 
our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel  especially in light of our recent additions of senior management  reorganizations and restructurings 
the loss of any key employee  the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees  particularly technical and management  as needed  could harm our business 
in addition  as we add more complex software product offerings  it will become increasingly important to retain and attract individuals who are skilled in managing and developing these complex software product offerings 
further  many of our key employees in israel  who are responsible for development of our network systems products  are obligated to perform annual military reserve duty and may be called to active duty at any time under emergency conditions 
the loss of the services of any executive officer or other key technical or management personnel could harm our business 
we experienced significant growth in our business and operations due to internal expansion and business acquisitions during the last five years  and if we do not appropriately manage this growth and any future growth  our operating results will be negatively affected 
our business has grown in recent years through both internal expansion and business acquisitions  and continued growth may cause a significant strain on our infrastructure  internal systems and managerial resources 
for example  our annual revenues increased from million in to million in  and during the past twelve fiscal quarters  we acquired accord  circa  picturetel  aspi and meetu 
further  our headcount increased from employees at december  to employees at december  and to  employees at december  to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our infrastructure  including information technology and financial operating and administrative systems and controls  and continue managing headcount  capital and processes in an efficient manner 
our productivity and the quality of our products may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively and coordinate among our executive  engineering  finance  marketing  sales  operations and customer support organizations  all of which add to the complexity of our organization and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  our information technology systems may not grow at a sufficient rate to keep up with the processing and information demands place on them by a much larger company 
the efforts to continue to expand our information technology systems or our inability to do so could harm our business 
further  revenues may not grow at a sufficient rate to absorb the costs associated with a larger overall headcount 
our future growth may require significant additional resources 
we cannot assure you that resources will be available when we need them or that we will have sufficient capital to fund these potential resource needs 
also  as we assess our resources following our acquisitions  we will likely determine that redundancy in certain areas will require consolidation of these resources 
any organizational disruptions associated with the consolidation process could require further management attention and financial expenditures 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  if we experience a shortfall in resources or if we must take additional restructuring charges  our results of operations will be harmed 
difficulties in integrating our acquisitions could adversely impact our business 
difficulties in integrating past or future acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
we completed the acquisition of picturetel in october and voyant in january the complex process of integrating voyant has required and will continue to require significant resources and has been and will continue to be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to our business 
this integration has resulted in the diversion of management and financial resources from our core business objectives 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of this acquisition or to successfully integrate the operations of voyant could harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from this acquisition because of the following significant challenges potentially incompatible cultural differences between the two companies  revenue concentration with a few large service provider customers  majority of orders received in the last month of a quarter  typically the last few weeks of that quarter and the unpredictability of receipt of orders  incorporating voyant s technology and products into our current and future product lines  geographic dispersion of operations  generating marketing demand for an expanded product line  integrating voyant s products with our business  as we have limited experience in the service provider market  the difficulty in leveraging voyant s and our combined technologies and capabilities across all product lines and customer bases  and our inability to retain previous voyant customers or employees 
the picturetel acquisition is the largest acquisition we have completed  and the complex process of integrating picturetel has required significant resources 
we continue to face ongoing business challenges that include principally the geographic dispersion of our operations and generating market demand for an expanded product line that includes pc based systems and collaboration intensive applications 
in addition  we have incurred significant costs and committed significant management time integrating picturetel s operations  technology  development programs  products  information systems  customers and personnel 
although the integration of picturetel is complete  we will continue to incur cash outflows and additional costs in completing the integration process  such as fees and expenses of professionals and consultants involved in dissolving legal entities no longer being used  costs associated with vacating  subleasing and closing facilities and terminating leases  employee severance costs  including any further reorganization of the service business  and upgrading our customer service information systems to accommodate picturetel s larger customer service function 
we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses 
the efficient and effective integration of our acquired businesses into our organization is critical to our growth 
in addition to voyant and picturetel  we acquired the following businesses in our prior fiscal years accord networks ltd  or accord  in february  circa communications  ltd  or circa  in april  atlanta signal processors  incorporated  or aspi  in november  and meetu 
com  inc  or meetu  in june these and any future acquisitions involve numerous risks including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies 
failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of these and any future acquisitions or to successfully integrate the operations of the companies we acquire could also harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will not incur material charges in future quarters to reflect additional costs associated with past acquisitions or any future acquisitions we may make 
our failure to implement our restructuring plan related to picturetel facilities could adversely impact our business 
we have a significant liability of approximately million at december  related to vacant and redundant facilities in connection with our acquisition of picturetel which is net of estimated sublease income we expect to generate 
our estimate of sublease income is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if actual sublease income is lower than our estimates for any reason  if it takes us longer than we estimated to sublease these facilities  or if the associated cost of subleasing or terminating our lease obligations for these facilities is greater than we estimated  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business  results of operations and cash flows 
for example  we have an approximately  square foot building which is fully subleased to a third party for the length of our lease obligation 
if this tenant were unable to fulfill  for any reason  their contractual obligations under the sublease  we would incur additional charges to operations which would harm our business 
in addition  until our vacated and redundant facilities are subleased or the lease obligations for these facilities are terminated  we will continue to pay the contractual lease and facility operating expense obligations without any sublease income to offset these costs 
further  in the event that we agree to sublease a facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow up to and potentially exceeding our recorded liability at the time of such transaction  which would harm our operating cash flows 
to the extent that any such cash outflows or additional costs exceed the amount of our recorded liability related to the sublease or termination of these lease obligations  we could incur a charge to operations which would harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations 
in november  we entered into a lease amendment for one of our facilities for which we had previously provided a restructuring reserve 
the original term of this lease  which ended in  was amended to allow us to exit approximately one third of the space in this facility which is currently unoccupied in november for a cash payment of million  to exit an additional approximately one third of the space in this facility which is currently unoccupied in november for an additional cash payment of million  and to allow us the option of exiting the remaining one third of this facility which is currently occupied in november the amendment also gives the landlord the right  until november to require us to exit the occupied space with six months notice 
if we  either voluntarily  or as required by the landlord  exit the occupied space we will make a final million payment to the landlord and we would begin to amortize our remaining leasehold improvements net book value of million at december  over six months 
should we or the landlord terminate our lease on the occupied space we would have six months to plan for and relocate these operations 
this relocation could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 
the lease agreement was also amended to allow the landlord to sublet the unoccupied space earlier than november and november if the landlord is successful in releasing us from the space earlier than the amendment provides  we would make the related cash payments noted above  as regards to the currently unoccupied space only  and additional cash payments pertaining to fifty percent of the cash savings related to us no longer having to pay rent and common area maintenance charges on that portion of the building 
to the extent that we or the landlord exercise their rights under this amendment  we will incur significant cash outflows 
we face risks related to our international operations and sales 
because of our significant operations in israel  we are subject to risks associated with the military  political and regulatory environment in israel and the middle east region 
the principal research and development and manufacturing facilities of our network systems group and many of that group s suppliers are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel and the middle east region directly affect our network systems group s operations 
a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its geographic neighbors 
current and future armed conflicts or political instability in the region may impair our ability to produce and sell our network systems products and could disrupt research or developmental activities 
this instability could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
further  the military action in iraq or other countries in the region perceived as a threat by the united states government could result in additional unrest or cause israel to be attacked which would adversely affect our results of operations and harm our business 
the technology used to develop our current network systems products was developed in part with grants from the israeli office of the chief scientist 
under israeli law  technology developed pursuant to grants from the office of the chief scientist cannot be transferred to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer certain of our technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and the development of additional network systems products and significantly reduce the value of the technology 
we are in the process of developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan that could provide for manufacturing to be performed outside of israel on a limited basis today  and a more extended basis in the event of a disaster 
the implementation of such a disaster recovery plan could subject us to additional payments to the office of the chief scientist  which could adversely affect our operating results 
international sales and expenses represent an increasing portion of our net revenues and operating expenses and risks inherent in international operations could harm our business 
international sales and expenses represent an increasing portion of our net revenues and operating expenses  and we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future and that international operating expenses will continue to increase 
international sales and expenses are subject to certain inherent risks  including the following adverse economic conditions in international markets  the near and long term impact of the military action in iraq or other hostilities  the recurrence of sars or other similar event  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  adverse economic impact of terrorist attacks and incidents and any military response to those attacks  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  potentially adverse tax consequences  and potential foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
international net revenues may fluctuate as a percentage of total net revenues in the future as we introduce new products 
these fluctuations are primarily the result of our practice of introducing new products in north america first and the additional time required for product homologation and regulatory approvals of new products in international markets 
to the extent we are unable to expand international sales in a timely and cost effective manner  especially in our core european markets of france  germany and the united kingdom  our business could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
although  to date  a substantial majority of our international sales has been denominated in us currency  we expect that a growing number of sales could be denominated in non us currencies as more international customers request billing in their currency 
our international operating expenses are denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  we expect our business will be significantly more vulnerable to currency fluctuations which could adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors invoice in foreign currency  today  which could be a disadvantage to us 
in  our operating costs internationally have increased as a result of the weakness in the us dollar 
these currency fluctuations are recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our increased exposure to currency fluctuations  we from time to time engage in currency hedging activities solely to mitigate temporary currency fluctuation exposure 
however  we have limited experience with these hedging activities  and they may not be successful which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates  as happened in the european market in and in the asian market in late  could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  leading to a reduction in revenue or profitability in that country  as discounts may be temporarily or permanently affected 
we have limited supply sources for some key components of our products  and our operations could be harmed by supply interruptions  component defects or unavailability of these components 
some key components used in our products are currently available from only one source and others are available from only a limited number of sources  including some key integrated circuits and optical elements 
we also obtain certain plastic housings  metal castings and other components from suppliers located in china and certain southeast asia countries  and any political or economic instability in that region in the future  quarantines or other restrictions associated with a recurrence of sars or other infectious diseases  or future import restrictions  may cause delays or an inability to obtain these supplies 
further  we have suppliers in israel and the military action in iraq or war with other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government may cause delays or an inability to obtain supplies for our network systems products 
we have no raw material supply commitments from our suppliers and generally purchase components on a purchase order basis either directly or through our contract manufacturers 
we have had limited experience purchasing supplies of various components for our products  and some of the components included in our products  such as microprocessors and other integrated circuits  have from time to time been subject to limited allocations by suppliers 
in addition  companies with limited or uncertain financial resources manufacture some of these components 
in the event that we  or our contract manufacturers  are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of components  develop alternative sources as needed  or companies with limited financial resources go out of business  our operating results could be seriously harmed 
moreover  our operating results would be seriously harmed by receipt of a significant number of defective components  an increase in component prices or our inability to obtain lower component prices in response to competitive price reductions 
additionally  our video communications products are designed based on integrated circuits produced by philips semiconductor  or philips and equator technologies  and cameras produced by sony 
if we could no longer obtain integrated circuits or cameras from these suppliers  we would incur substantial expense and take substantial time in redesigning our products to be compatible with components from other manufacturers  and we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining these components from alternative sources in a timely or cost effective manner 
additionally  both sony and philips compete with us in the video communications industry which may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary components 
the failure to obtain adequate supplies of vital components could prevent or delay product shipments which could harm our business 
we also rely on the introduction schedules of some key components in the development or launch of new products 
any delays in the availability of these key components could harm our business 
in addition  the business failure or financial instability of any supplier of these components could adversely affect our cash flows if we were to expend funds in some manner to ensure our supply of those components 
manufacturing disruption or capacity constraints would harm our business 
we subcontract the manufacture of our voice and video product lines to celestica  a third party contract manufacturer 
we use celestica s facilities in thailand  china and singapore  and should there be any disruption in services due to natural disaster  quarantines or other restrictions associated with a recurrence of sars  or other similar events  or economic or political difficulties in any of these countries or asia or any other reason  such disruption would harm our business and results of operations 
also  celestica s facilities are currently the primary source manufacturer of these products  and if celestica experiences an interruption in operations or otherwise suffers from capacity constraints  we would experience a delay in shipping these products which would have an immediate negative impact on our revenues 
as a result  we may not be able to meet demand for our products which could negatively affect revenues in the quarter of the disruption and harm our reputation 
in addition  operating in the international environment exposes us to certain inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and potentially adverse tax consequences  all of which could harm our business and results of operations 
further  our network systems products are manufactured in israel which is currently experiencing internal and external conflicts that include terrorist acts and military action 
also  the military action in iraq or war with other middle eastern countries perceived as a threat by the united states government could cause us to experience a manufacturing disruption due to acts associated with these conflicts which could harm our business 
in addition  certain technology used in our network systems products was developed through grants from the office of the chief scientist in israel 
under israeli law  it is prohibited to transfer technology developed pursuant to these grants to any person without the prior written consent of the office of the chief scientist 
the grants also contain restrictions on the ability to manufacture products developed with these grants outside of israel 
approval to manufacture such products outside of israel  if granted  is generally subject to an increase in the total amount to be repaid to the office of the chief scientist of between to of the amount granted  depending on the extent of the manufacturing to be conducted outside of israel 
these restrictions on the ability to transfer technology to third parties or manufacture products outside israel may adversely affect our operating results and significantly reduce the value of the technology developed under these grants 
we are in the process of developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan that could call for manufacturing to be performed outside of israel on a limited basis  and a more extended basis in the event of a disaster 
today we are performing final test and assembly on a limited basis  in atlanta  georgia 
the implementation of such a disaster recovery plan could subject us to additional payments to the office of the chief scientist  which could adversely affect our operating results 
if we have insufficient proprietary rights or if we fail to protect those rights we have  our business would be materially impaired 
we rely on third party license agreements and termination or impairment of these agreements may cause delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments which would harm our business 
we have licensing agreements with various suppliers for software incorporated into our products 
for example  we license video communications source code from adtran  ebsnet  mitsubishi  omnitel  radvision and telesoft  video algorithm protocols from ezenia and real networks  development source code from avaya  cisco systems  hughes software systems  ltd 
and philips semiconductor  audio algorithms from lucent technologies  nortel networks and texas instruments  communication software from databeam and windows software from microsoft 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the termination or impairment of these licenses could result in delays or reductions in new product introductions or current product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  licensed and integrated  if at all possible  which would harm our business and results of operations 
we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary rights which may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our proprietary rights 
others may independently develop similar proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our intellectual property rights or disclose such technology 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any patent or registered trademark owned by us will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged in the us or foreign countries or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us or that any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
in addition  foreign intellectual property laws may not protect our intellectual property rights 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could harm our business  and could ultimately be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we face and might in the future face intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products 
for example  on september   a suit captioned collaboration properties  inc v 
polycom  inc 
was filed in the united states court in the northern district of california 
the complaint alleges that our viewstation  viavideo  ipower  weboffice and path navigator products infringe us patents owned by plaintiff 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and exemplary damages for past and present infringement and to permanently enjoin us from infringing on the patents in the future 
on november   we filed an answer asserting  among other things  no infringement and that plaintiff s patents are invalid and unenforceable 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses and counterclaims  and intend to vigorously defend this action 
however  litigation involves significant inherent risks and uncertainties  and if an adverse outcome was to occur it could significantly harm our business 
the costs associated with defending this litigation  or any other patent litigation in the future  are unpredictable and expensive and could cause general and administrative expenses to increase in a given quarter which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flow in that quarter 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions which have resulted in significant and protracted and expensive litigation 
in the past  we have been involved in such litigation which adversely affected our operating results 
for example  in november  videoserver  inc  now known as ezenia inc  filed a patent infringement claim against accord s us subsidiary  and accord was subsequently added as a defendant 
in september  accord and its us subsidiary entered into a settlement agreement with ezenia under which the case was dismissed and accord paid million to ezenia 
we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any such litigation  that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using the technologies subject to any such claims or be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to  and legal costs associated with  litigation can have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
business interruptions could adversely affect our operations 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  typhoon  power loss  telecommunications failure  quarantines or other restrictions associated with a recurrence of sars  or other similar events  national catastrophe  such as the terrorist attacks which occurred on september   war  ongoing iraqi disturbances  an attack on israel and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a fully implemented detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our cash flow could fluctuate due to the potential difficulty of collecting our receivables 
over the past few years  we initiated significant investments in europe and asia to expand our business in these regions 
in europe and asia  as with other international regions  credit terms are typically longer than in the united states 
therefore  as europe  asia and other international regions grow as a percentage of our net revenues  as happened from through  accounts receivable balances will likely increase as compared to previous years 
although  from time to time  we have been able to largely offset the effects of these influences through additional incentives offered to channel partners at the end of each quarter in the form of prepaid discounts  these additional incentives have lowered our profitability 
in addition  the recurrence of economic uncertainty or downturn in technology spending in the united states may restrict the availability of capital which may delay our collections from our channel partners beyond our historical experience or may cause companies to file for bankruptcy  which occurred with global crossing  worldcom and mcsi 
either of these conditions would harm our cash flow and days sales outstanding performance 
although in recent quarters our experience in collecting receivables has been good and we expect this trend to continue  there can be no assurance that it will continue 
over the past several quarters  our days sales outstanding dso metrics have improved to record levels 
there is no assurance that the current level of dso will be maintained and in all likelihood dso metrics will go up as revenues increase  as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity as a result of fluctuations in revenue linearity  as a result of extending credit terms to customers who have previously been on cash terms  as a result of future acquisitions  or any other factors 
our stock price fluctuates as a result of the conduct of our business and stock market fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including statements or changes in opinions  ratings or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business  including competitors  partners  suppliers or telecommunications industry leaders or relating to us specifically  as has occurred recently  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  general market conditions or market conditions specific to technology industries  domestic and international macroeconomic factors  and any other factors  including those factors discussed in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other factors affecting future operations 
in addition  the stock market continues to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies like us 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and bank borrowings 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio which only includes highly liquid  high quality instruments  with the exception of the million invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
we may occasionally use forward contracts as a hedge against currency exchange rate fluctuations which may affect the value of trade receivables billed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
as of december   we have no open foreign currency hedging contracts 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us  state and municipal government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt and equity securities  of which a total of million was strategically invested in certain equity securities of publicly traded companies at december  these investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies are subject to market price fluctuations which are primarily influenced by changes in interest rates and credit quality and are marked to market each period by recording an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
if we sell our short term or long term investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
for  and  we realized million  million  and million in losses related to the sale or write down of our strategic investments in certain equity securities of publicly traded companies  which is reflected in loss on strategic investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents and investments in equity securities of publicly traded companies  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a twelve month time horizon in thousands issuer valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points current fair market value valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps us government securities state and local governments corporate debt securities total the following table estimates the fair value of the portfolio at a six month time horizon in thousands issuer valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points current fair market value valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps us government securities state and local governments corporate debt securities total a substantial majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
however  we are selling ipower products and related services in some local currencies  primarily euros  british pounds  hong kong dollars  singapore dollars and japanese yen  which have increased our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  in the event of a significant transaction due in a foreign currency  we may enter into a foreign currency forward exchange contract for hedging purposes 
in connection with the acquisition of picturetel completed in october  we assumed picturetel s existing hedging program to hedge intercompany receivables between picturetel and its foreign subsidiaries 
two forward contracts were entered during the month of december for million and matured during the first quarter of and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there were no forward contracts outstanding as of december  or
