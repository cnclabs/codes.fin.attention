management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company rtw  inc rtw and its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  american compensation insurance company acic  provide disability management services to employers 
collectively  we  our and us refer to these entities in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have developed two proprietary management systems i the rtw solution  designed to lower employers workers compensation costs and return injured employees to work as soon as possible  and ii id  designed to identify those injured employees who are likely to become inappropriately dependent on the workers compensation system 
we currently provide workers compensation management services to employers insured through our insurance subsidiary  to self insured employers on a fee for service basis and on a consulting basis charging hourly fees 
during  we operated primarily in minnesota  colorado and michigan 
in  we closed our regional offices in missouri which served missouri  illinois and kansas and massachusetts which served massachusetts  connecticut  new hampshire  rhode island and maine 
collectively  these regional offices had remaining premiums in force totaling million at december  we completed running off this business in february on march   our am best financial rating was upgraded from b fair  vulnerable to b very good  secure as a result of i our continued profitable operating performance in  and ii improved capitalization in acic as statutory surplus increased to million at december  from million at december  due to our earnings in we believe that our b rating from am best may make it difficult to provide our products to certain employers

challenges  risks  uncertainties and trends we derive our revenue almost entirely from workers compensation insurance premiums and investment income including gains and losses from sales of securities 
a small portion of our revenue is derived from non insurance workers compensation services 
we are subject to the 
table of contents challenges  risks  uncertainties and trends that affect the workers compensation property and casualty insurance sector of our economy including the following workers compensation is a state regulated industry workers compensation is governed and regulated by state governmental agencies 
we are and will be subject to state regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services  now and in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change and any change may adversely affect our operations 
workers compensation claims and related expenses can be volatile 
worker s compensation is a long tailed property and casualty insurance line 
claims for a given year are open on average for twelve to thirteen years and it is not unusual for workers compensation insurers to have claims open for thirty or more years 
we have operated our insurance company since and therefore have limited experience years  and accordingly  are subject to volatility 
see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses 
workers compensation is subject to inflationary pressures 
worker s compensation is subject to both medical and wage inflation 
the cost of medical care has increased in recent years faster than inflation  in excess of 
this has resulted in reduced profitability in the workers compensation insurance line 
new medical procedures could evolve and new legal theories developed that could cause older claims to re open and increase expense 
see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses 
workers compensation pricing is cyclical 
in  we were able to increase premium rates on renewing policies 
this compares to rate increases of  and realized in  and  respectively 
these increases came after many years of pricing decreases that unfavorably affected the industry in the late s 
if we are unable to maintain rate increases  our profit margin will be adversely affected 
see further discussion under premiums in force and gross premiums earned 
reinsurance costs for workers compensation have increased 
reinsurance costs for the entire sector increased over the prior year continuing a pattern of cost increases beginning in these higher costs  if not recovered through increased pricing from our customers  will adversely affect our profit margin 
see further discussion under premiums ceded 
low interest rates reduce our investment income 
interest rates for investment grade instruments are at historic lows 
our investment income is directly affected by the interest rate at which we invest our free cash flow 
the current rate environment has contributed to a significant mortgage refinancing boom  resulting in prepayment of our mortgage backed investments and an increase in our cash on hand in acic 
a continuation of this trend and environment will adversely affect our investment income

financial summary this financial summary presents our discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rtw  inc this review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements at december  
table of contents the following table provides an overview of our key operating results s  except per share amounts year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums earned total revenues claim and claim settlement expenses net income loss diluted income loss per share rtw reported a decrease in gross premiums earned to million in from million in total revenues decreased in to million from million in due to a decrease in premiums in force related primarily to our regional office closures and non renewing insurance policies for professional employer organizations peo s in michigan 
we reported net income of million in compared to net income of million in and a net loss of million in we reported basic and diluted income per share of and  respectively  in compared to basic and diluted income per share of in and basic and diluted net loss per share of in the primary factors affecting our operating results included the following gross premiums earned decreased in from due primarily to a decrease in average premiums in force to million for from million in see further discussion under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  premiums earned decreased in from premiums earned in reflect i the decrease in premiums in force as a result of the run off policies in our discontinued regions and from our actions in removing unprofitable accounts  ii an increase in premiums ceded as our cost of excess of loss increased significantly in  and iii additional ceded premiums as we lowered retentions in all our regions to  to reduce volatility in our operating results 
additionally  in  premiums ceded increased by  resulting from a change in cost related to excess of loss reinsurance in minnesota compared to a million decrease in excess of loss premiums ceded in  in addition to the factors affecting premiums earned  total revenues also declined as net realized investment gains decreased to  in from million in  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to of premiums earned for from for see further discussion under claim and claim settlement expenses  and at december   we maintained a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
this allowance was originally established at december  at million  and was decreased by million in and million in the million and million decreases in the valuation allowance favorably affected our income tax expense in and  respectively 
see further discussion under income taxes 
we expect premiums in force to increase from levels in we also anticipate that we will continue to realize slight premium rate increases in  consistent with those realized in but significantly lower than experienced in we further expect to increase alternative  non risk revenue in we will focus on achieving profitability in our markets by i aggressively managing and closing claims  ii reviewing policy profitability at renewal and removing unprofitable accounts  and iii aggressively managing policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
in the following pages  we take a look at the  and operating results for items in our consolidated statement of operations and also explain key balance sheet accounts in greater detail 

table of contents results of operations total revenues our total revenues include premiums earned  investment income  net realized investment gains and other income 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenues and premiums in force s year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums earned investment income net realized investment gains realized investment gains realized investment losses net realized investment gains other income total revenues premiums in force by regional office at year end minnesota colorado michigan missouri massachusetts total premiums in force premiums in force and gross premiums earned premiums on workers compensation insurance policies are our largest source of revenue 
premiums earned are the gross premiums earned by us on in force workers compensation policies  net of the effects of ceded premiums under reinsurance agreements 
the premium we charge a policyholder is a function of its payroll  industry and prior workers compensation claims experience 
in underwriting a policy  we receive policyholder payroll estimates for the ensuing year 
we record premiums written on an installment basis matching our billing to the policyholder and earn premiums on a daily basis over the life of each insurance policy based on the payroll estimate 
we record the excess of premiums billed over premiums earned for each policy as unearned premiums on our balance sheet 
when a policy expires  we audit employer payrolls for the policy period and adjust the estimated payroll and the policyholder s premium to its actual value 
the result is a final audit adjustment recorded to premiums earned when the adjustment becomes known 
final audit premiums recognized during the period include billed final audit premiums plus or minus the change in estimate for premiums on unexpired and expired unaudited policies 
our premiums in force increased to million at december  from million at december  premiums in force in our minnesota and colorado regions grew million and million  respectively  in the increases in the minnesota and colorado regions were offset by a million decrease in michigan  resulting primarily from our non renewal of approximately million of peo business  partially offset by new business written 
we also completed run off of the remaining policies in our missouri and massachusetts regions in february average premiums in force decreased to million in from million in and million in in order to improve profitability  we aggressively targeted policies that did not meet our underwriting profit margin standards for non renewal or 
table of contents re underwriting at increased rates at policy expiration in  and our average annual premium per policy increased to  in from  in and  in as a result of the focused aggressive re underwriting in those years 
our gross premiums earned decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in average premiums in force  offset by ii final audit premiums which increased gross premiums earned by  in  compared to a million decrease in gross premiums earned decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted from i the decrease in average premiums in force  and ii final audit premiums which decreased gross premiums earned by million in compared to a million increase in in  and  we were able to increase premium rates on renewing policies an average of  and  respectively 
we have been able to increase premium rates in our markets due to the following many workers compensation insurers have withdrawn from the markets in which we write premiums as profitability diminished in the workers compensation insurance line  reinsurance rates for workers compensation insurers have increased due to i reductions in reinsurer s surplus as a result of the september  terrorist acts against the united states  ii recent unprofitability resulting from highly competitive reinsurance pricing  iii settlements related to certain reinsurance treaties written in the late s  iv five major reinsurers leaving the market in  and v low investment yields 
these rate increases have resulted in increased costs for workers compensation insurers 
insurers  including rtw  have raised premium rates to offset these increases in reinsurance premiums  and a number of workers compensation insurers financial ratings decreased due to reserve adjustments recorded in  and resulting in a reduced capacity and creditworthiness of those insurers 
premiums ceded reinsurance agreements allow us to share certain risks with other insurance companies 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from potential losses in excess of the level we are willing to accept 
we expect the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance to honor their obligations 
in the event that these companies are unable to honor their obligations to us  we will be required to pay these obligations ourselves 
we are not aware of any developments with respect to our reinsurers that would result in uncollectible reinsurance balances 
under our excess of loss reinsurance policies  we pay reinsurers to limit our per incident exposure and record this cost to premiums ceded as a reduction of gross premiums earned 
in minnesota  we are required to purchase excess of loss coverage for our minnesota policies from the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association wcra 
the following table summarizes our reinsurance coverage all losses ceded on a per occurrence basis covers losses per occurrence in excess of limited to minnesota wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers   wcra  statutory limit wcra  statutory limit non minnesota various reinsurers  million excluding acts of terrorism various reinsurers  million various reinsurers  statutory limit

the following table summarizes the components of premiums ceded s year ended december  premiums ceded excess of loss reinsurance premiums wcra and other non minnesota excess of loss policies  to  excess of loss policy premiums ceded premiums ceded to reinsurers increased to million in from million in the increase in premiums ceded  resulted primarily from i our cost for excess of loss reinsurance coverage in our non minnesota regions increased substantially in while our minnesota cost decreased only slightly  ii we decreased our retention to  in all our regions in by purchasing increased excess of loss coverage in order to further reduce volatility in our operating results  and iii the results include a  increase in excess of loss premiums ceded resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for the wcra compared to a million decrease in excess of loss premiums ceded in premiums ceded to reinsurers decreased to million in from million in the decrease in premiums ceded resulted from i a million reduction in premiums ceded under our  to  excess of loss reinsurance policy  ii a million reduction in excess of loss premiums ceded resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for minnesota excess of loss coverage  and iii a decrease in gross premiums earned offset by an increase in non minnesota excess of loss costs in outlook the outlook for premiums in force  gross premiums earned and premiums ceded include the following factors premium rates are expected to increase only slightly on new and renewing policies as we filed our rates at the high end in each region in which we operated in and  leaving little room to further increase rates in we expect to continue to improve and add to our agency relationships in coupled with an improved am best rating  we expect to increase premiums in force in with new business increases occurring primarily in our minnesota and michigan regions  our gross premiums earned will move in the same direction as our premiums in force  lagging slightly as premiums are earned over the term of the insurance policy  and premiums ceded under excess of loss policies will increase significantly as a percent of gross premiums earned when compared to the results attained for we have established a  retention in all our regions in the cost of excess of loss reinsurance has increased at all retention levels and for all regions in investment income and net realized investment gains our investment income includes earnings on our investment portfolio and  in and  interest on our deposit receivable 
our net realized investment gains  displayed separately on our accompanying consolidated statements of operations  include gains and losses from sales of securities 
in  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized investment gains totaling  in and  we sold certain securities within the portfolio and realized investment gains totaling million and million  respectively  as we repositioned the portfolio 
recognition of realized investment gains and losses in the future would depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we replace securities to manage our portfolio returns 
at december  and  we were invested entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable fixed maturity investments 
we also held significant cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
in december  we received million 
table of contents from terminating our contract with st 
paul re spr 
this amount was reinvested in january and february in order to reduce the near term interest rate risk on the portfolio  we built our cash position throughout by holding cash received on mortgage backed security prepayments and through sales of securities in september with the expectation that interest rates will rise in the near term 
subsequent to december   we began to diversify our portfolio by investing in tax exempt municipal securities to take advantage of the tax benefits of those securities and interest rate spreads 
we classify our investments as available for sale 
we intend to hold our available for sale investments to maturity  but may sell them before maturity in response to tax planning considerations  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and changes in funding sources or terms  or to address liquidity needs 
our primary investment objective is to maintain a diversified  high quality  fixed investment portfolio structured to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
for further discussion of investments  see the investments section of this management s discussion and analysis 
investment income decreased to million in from million in after excluding  of interest earned on our deposit receivable from spr in  for which there was no equivalent amount earned in  investment income increased slightly to million in from million in investment income increased slightly as average invested assets increased to million in from in this increase in investment income resulting from the increase in assets invested was offset by a decrease in interest rates during interest rates declined early in the year  reaching a low point in june before returning to beginning of the year levels by december approximately million of mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio were repaid earlier than expected due to the significant consumer mortgage refinancing that occurred in the funds that came available could not be reinvested at comparable rates  causing the book investment yield to decline from our book investment yield  excluding cash and cash equivalents  declined to at december  from at december  the investment yields realized in future periods will be affected by yields attained on new investments 
investment income decreased to million in from million in investment income decreased as our invested assets decreased to million at december  from million at december  and our investment yields decreased as we moved out of corporate securities in and reinvested in lower yielding securities due to changes in market interest rates and our desire to lower risk by buying higher rated government and mortgage backed securities 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest earned on our deposit receivable to  in from  in our invested assets decreased due to decreases in operating cash flow in and  resulting primarily from i reduced premiums in force and premiums written  ii timing differences between paying premiums ceded and recovering paid claim and claim settlement expenses  iii the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses  and iv net cash provided by lower investment income 
investment yields decreased to for from for the investment yields realized in future periods would be affected by yields attained on new investments 
outlook we expect that income from our investment portfolio for will be affected by the following our investment in tax exempt municipal bonds will reduce investment income and favorably affect net income as investment yields will be lower on a pre tax basis but will be higher on a tax adjusted basis  we expect interest rates to increase in the timing of any such rate increases in unknown at this time 
we intend to invest our excess cash into higher yielding investments in as the rates increase  cash flows for are expected to be adversely affected by decreases in cash flows resulting from claim payments on claims from and prior years offset by cash flows from our premiums as we increase our premiums earned in  
table of contents recognition of realized investment gains and losses will depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we reposition our portfolio to further manage our portfolio returns  and new and renegotiated reinsurance treaties may affect our future cash flow and future investment income 
other income we recorded and received a refund totaling million from the wcra in the wcra periodically reviews its surplus position and refunds excess surplus to its members 
this refund represents our share of the excess surplus of the wcra at december  no such refunds were received in or we do  however  expect that fee for service revenues will increase in from the  and  realized in and  respectively 
total expenses our expenses include claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income taxes 
claim and claim settlement expenses claim expenses refer to medical and indemnity benefits that we have paid or expect to pay to claimants for events that have occurred 
the costs of investigating  resolving and processing these claims are referred to as claim settlement expenses 
we record these expenses  net of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts  to claim and claim settlement expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
claim and claim settlement expenses are our largest expense and result in our largest liability 
we establish reserves that reflect our estimates of the total claim and claim settlement expenses we will ultimately have to pay under our workers compensation insurance policies 
these include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
for further discussion of reserve determination  see the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we experienced a decrease in the estimated number of ultimate claims for compared to and the number of estimated ultimate claims by accident year decreased to approximately  in from  in and  in the net decrease correlates directly to i the decrease in gross earned premiums  and ii the re underwriting that we completed with respect to our in force policies in and the gross and net average estimated cost per claim which includes both claim and claim settlement expenses totaled approximately  and  in compared to  and  in and  and  in  respectively 
the decrease in gross and net average estimated cost per claim is primarily the result of our improved ability to manage cases and claims offset by increases in severity ie  the average cost of a claim caused mainly by inflationary pressures 
the trend of increasing severity is attributable to a combination of factors that include increasing medical costs and increasing indemnity payments reimbursements to injured workers for lost wages per claim 
we have also observed a decline in the number of claims being reported over the last several years 
the declining frequency of claims contributes to the increasing severity trend because the frequency decline has been concentrated in less expensive claims claims involving less time off from work and less severe injuries 
the number of claims reported but unpaid open claims and the approximate average gross and net reserves on these claims each period was  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve  and claims   average gross reserve   average net reserve 
the average gross and net reserves per claim are less in than in and as the open claims include newly reported claims from the later half of  including many with much lower severity that have not had time to close  as well as new claims that are incurred but not yet reported 
the remaining open claims from and are primarily claims with significant injury characteristics resulting in the increase in outstanding average gross and net reserves per claim 

table of contents compared to claim and claim settlement expenses decreased significantly to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to in from in these changes are due to the following the decrease in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include an million decrease in prior years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  iii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited twelve year historical claim data and our small claim population  claim and claims settlement expenses decreased in total due to the overall decrease in average premiums in force and decreased as a percent of gross premiums earned as premium rate increases realized in and flow through premium earned  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 
compared to claim and claim settlement expenses decreased significantly to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to in from in these changes are due to the following the decrease in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  the results include an million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million increase in prior years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i in march  the minnesota state legislature changed the way the commissioner assessed self insured employers and insurers for estimated liabilities and administrative expenses of the minnesota special compensation fund 
the assessment changed from being paid by the insurer on an indemnity payment basis to an assessment charged on premium to the policyholder 
we decreased our recorded accrual in to reflect this legislative change  ii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  iii we overestimated the liability for our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate in and reversed that excess in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  we recorded estimates of ceded paid and unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses under our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement totaling million in resulting in a corresponding reduction in claim and claim settlement expenses 
no such benefit was recorded in  we increased renewal premium rates an average of in and in compared to premium rates for the same periods in and  respectively  reversing a trend of continued rate declines during years prior to increases in premium rates have the effect of reducing the ratio of claim and claim settlement expenses to gross premiums earned as losses do not increase with premium rate increases  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 

table of contents outlook we expect that claim and claim settlement expenses will be affected by the following factors claim costs will continue to be affected by i increases in medical and indemnity costs resulting from inflationary changes  ii severity experienced in future periods in our policyholder base  iii changes resulting from increases in operating efficiency and effectiveness realized through enhancements to our internal processes and procedures  including changes to our proprietary computer systems  and iv legislative changes that affect benefits payable under workers compensation laws  increases in premium rates  if any in  will result in increasing premiums earned without a corresponding increase in claim and claim settlement expenses  ultimately decreasing claim and claim settlement expense as a percent of premiums earned 
changes in premium rates due to legislative changes in estimated loss costs  increased competition and improving customer loss experience may offset rate improvements  and continued application of our claims management technology and methods to all open claims 
at this time  we do not know the ultimate result of these factors on claim and claim settlement expenses as a percent of premiums earned 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs are costs directly related to writing an insurance policy and consist of commissions  state premium taxes  underwriting personnel costs and expenses  sales and marketing costs and other underwriting expenses  less ceding commissions from our reinsurers 
ceding commissions are amounts that reinsurers pay to us for placing reinsurance with them 
the following table summarizes policy acquisition costs s year ended december  commission expense premium tax expense other policy acquisition costs direct policy acquisition costs ceding commissions resulting from adjustments to claim and claim settlement estimates for our to accident years ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance total policy acquisition costs under certain of our excess of loss reinsurance policies  the reinsurer returns a portion of the premiums we cede as ceding commissions to reimburse us for our cost of placing and managing these policies 
ceding commissions received under these excess of loss reinsurance policies totaled million in and reduced our policy acquisition costs 
no similar ceding commissions existed in or excluding the effect of ceding commissions  policy acquisition costs increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  policy acquisition costs increased to in compared to in and in the increase in reflects the following gross premiums earned decreased significantly in compared to and resulting in corresponding decreases in policy acquisition costs  commission expense increased to of gross premiums earned in from in and decreased from in the increased commission percent in is the result of our new business growth in on which we pay higher first year commission rates 
in  our renewal business  on which we pay lower commission rates  significantly outpaced our new business 
in all of our markets  we believe the commission rates we pay are marketplace competitive  
table of contents premium tax expense increased slightly to of gross premiums earned in from of gross premiums earned in and decreased slightly from in  and other policy acquisition costs were affected by the following i in  we recorded a million increase in other policy acquisition costs reflecting a reallocation of mandatory reinsurance pool expenses  we were not assessed any reallocation in  ii in  michigan changed the basis of its second injury fund assessment from a claims based assessment to a premium based assessment  resulting in an  benefit in compared to no benefit received in  iii in  we received a  favorable adjustment from a state data collection agency resulting from our significant decrease in premiums  and iv a general decrease related to the decrease in gross premiums earned 
outlook we expect that policy acquisition costs in will remain relatively flat as a percent of gross premiums earned compared to after adjusting for the reallocation of mandatory reinsurance pool expenses 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  office rent  certain state administrative charges based on premiums and other costs and expenses not specific to claim and claim settlement expenses or policy acquisition costs 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and decreased from million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in and in general and administrative expenses increased in and decreased in as follows general and administrative expenses increased in from levels 
significant changes include i the reversal of a previously recorded contingent reinsurance commission resulting in  in expense in  ii  in expenses related to severance and relocation in  iii increased professional fees  and iv costs associated with investing in the necessary staff and infrastructure to position us for growth  general and administrative expenses declined significantly in from due to the following i million of restructuring charges related to office closures recorded in  while no offices were closed in  ii  of net margin expense was recorded in related to our st 
paul re contract compared to million in  and iii a decrease to  of insurance guarantee association iga assessments in compared to million of such iga assessments in  and general and administrative expenses increased as a percent of premiums earned  after adjusting for restructuring charges  iga assessments and one time charges as we had less revenue relative to our fixed operating costs and expenses 
we aggressively managed personnel and other operating costs and expenses during to appropriately align operating expenses with revenues 
all expenses continue to be managed aggressively and reduced where appropriate 
outlook we expect that general and administrative expenses will be affected by the following all expenses will continue to be aggressively managed and reduced where appropriate  we have no plans to open additional offices in  we will continually monitor reported claim counts in and re examine staffing needs as necessary  and we will make appropriate investments in infrastructure to position us for the future 
interest expense we incurred interest charges on our term loan in  and we originally borrowed million under the term loan in march and paid the remaining amount due in september 
table of contents the term loan accrued interest  payable quarterly 
we paid interest at rates ranging from to on the outstanding balance of our term loan in compared to to in interest expense decreased to  in from  in as a result of the decrease in interest rates  million in principal payments in and million in principal payments in we paid interest at rates ranging from to on the outstanding balance of our term loan in compared to to in interest expense decreased to  in from  in as a result of the change in interest rates and million in principal payments in outlook we expect to incur no interest charges in income taxes we incur federal income taxes on our combined service organization operations rtw and insurance operations acic 
we incur state income taxes on the results of our service organization s operations and incur premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes for substantially all of our insurance operations 
in certain instances  we may incur state income taxes on our insurance operations 
additionally  certain provisions of the internal revenue code adversely affect our taxable income by accelerating recognition and payment of income taxes 
adjustments to book income generating current tax assets and liabilities include limitations on the deductibility of unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  limitations on the deductibility of unearned premium reserves  limitations on deductions for bad debt reserves and the acceleration of expensing policy acquisition costs 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider recent operating results  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
at december   we established a million valuation allowance allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
in  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million as we were able to carry back our operating loss five years resulting in a million tax refund  the reversal of certain deferred tax items and use of the operating loss carry forward to offset income in this allowance further decreased by million in to million as we used the remaining operating loss carry forward to offset the income we earned in and further evaluated the asset we expect to realize based on our projected taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we expect any remaining deferred tax assets  net of the allowance  at december   to be realized as a result of the future income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
under the first provision of the job creation and worker assistance act of  signed into law in march  we were allowed to carry back our net operating loss for five years  to  instead of two years under previous law 
we filed our tax return in september  and received a refund totaling approximately million as a result of this federal legislative change from carrying back our loss 
an additional  receivable was recorded that related to the carry back that resulted from revising our financial statements for income tax benefit for the year ended december  included a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance as we offset current year earnings by losses carried forward from and  in alternative minimum tax expense 
income tax benefit for the year ended december  included the following i a million benefit from carrying back our loss five years under the tax law change  ii a million benefit resulting from reducing the allowance as we realized favorable claim reserve development in  and iii a further benefit as we offset current year earnings by losses carried forward from after excluding the effects of the benefits from reducing the allowance  income tax expense was million for compared to income tax expense of million for as a percent of income before income taxes  the income tax expense before any benefit from reducing the allowance was of the income before income taxes in compared to in and of the net loss before income taxes in outlook income tax expense will vary based on i the income from operations we earn in  ii the amount of tax exempt income we earn in  and iii the changes in the valuation allowance necessary during the ultimate change is unknown at this time 

table of contents investments our portfolio of fixed maturity securities included only us government securities  mortgage backed securities  and asset backed securities at december  our portfolio is managed by an independent investment manager to maximize our after tax investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
in  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized investment gains totaling  in  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to reduce risk and realized investment gains totaling million 
we conservatively manage our fixed maturity portfolio  investing only in investment grade bbb or better rating from standard and poor s securities of us domiciled issuers 
all securities in our portfolio were rated aaa at december  we do not invest in derivative securities 
operating cash flows consist of the deficit or excess of premiums collected over claim and claim settlement expenses paid reduced by payments for reinsurance premiums as well as other operating expenses paid 
investment cash flows consist of income on existing investments and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
prior to  we generated positive net cash flows from operations due  in part  to timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
these net cash flows decreased significantly in  and as we focused on closing old claims by paying earlier to close those claims 
combined with relatively flat premiums in force in  and and decreasing premiums since that time  our cash flows from differences in timing have decreased 
additionally  as we lowered our reinsurance retention levels to  in mid  we decreased our current period cash flows as a result of pre funding quarterly reinsurance premiums under that agreement 
reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement offset similar payments to claimants for those years in our investment portfolio decreased million to million at december  from million at december   as a result of these factors 
the cash balance at december  included million received from st 
paul re spr from terminating a contract late in december we invested this cash in january and february during  interest rates declined  leading to significant mortgage refinancing by consumers  resulting in prepayment or early redemption of our mortgage backed securities 
at december  our cash balance was million 
we expect that our investments and cash and cash equivalents will decrease in as we pay claims for and prior years  years in which we earned higher premiums and incurred a higher number of claims reported 
we record investments on our balance sheet at fair value  with the corresponding appreciation or depreciation from amortized cost recorded in shareholders equity as other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
because value is based on the relationship between the portfolio s stated yields and prevailing market yields at any given time  interest rate fluctuations can have a swift and significant impact on the carrying value of these securities 
as a result of classifying our securities as available for sale  and thus carrying them at fair value  we expect to encounter adjustments in shareholders equity as market interest rates and other factors change 
prevailing market interest rates increased slightly since december   and when combined with the sale of select securities to realize gains  resulted in a million unrealized gain on investments in compared to a million unrealized gain in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables at december   the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaled million and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaled million  resulting in net reserves totaling million 
the net reserve at december  totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaling million net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
accounting for workers compensation insurance operations requires us to estimate the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables  together  the net reserves at each balance sheet date 
our reserves represent the estimated total unpaid cost of claim and claim settlement expenses  which cover events that occurred in and prior years 
these reserves reflect our estimates of the total costs of claims that were reported  but not yet paid  and the cost of claims incurred but 
table of contents not yet reported ibnr 
for reported claims  we establish reserves on a case basis 
for ibnr claims  we calculate the difference between i projected ultimate claim and claim settlement expenses as determined using generally accepted actuarial standards  and ii case reserves and carry the difference as the ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr claims  we estimate the ultimate net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
the amount by which estimated net reserves  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development 
development is unfavorable or deficient when losses ultimately settle for more than the levels at which they were reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
development is favorable redundant when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on open claims 
favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves is reflected in earnings in the year recognized 
both internal and independent external actuaries review net reserves for adequacy on a periodic basis 
this review assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current events and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
when reviewing net reserves  actuaries analyze historical data and estimate the effect of various factors on estimated ultimate reserves including i trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of medical and wage inflation  ii estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  iii our and industry historical loss experience  and iv legislative enactments  legal developments and changes in social and political attitudes 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  including changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the effect of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the loss and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
due to our commencing operations in  we have limited historical data to estimate our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and  accordingly  we supplement our experience with external industry data  as adjusted  to reflect anticipated differences between our results and the industry 
estimating the effect that inflation will have on the ultimate cost of claims is a major risk factor in our workers compensation reserve estimates 
future earnings will be affected by reserve development associated with any changes in our inflation assumptions 
estimates for the and accident years represent the majority of the uncertainty because these claims have the lowest proportionate amount of paid loss as of december  and represent approximately fifty five percent of our net outstanding reserves 
our reserve estimates are most sensitive to changes in the assumption about inflation for the and accident years 
each one percent increase or decrease in the medical inflation rate for these accident years would increase or decrease our net loss reserve estimates at december  by approximately  our independent actuary provides management with an opinion regarding the acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted actuarial guidelines 
we record our net reserves by considering a range of estimates bounded by the high and low point of the range 
within that range  we record our estimate 
we focus in our decision process on improving our financial strength ratings and expect to remain a market for workers compensation insurance in all market conditions 
in we established recorded reserves in the upper half of the actuary s range 
the ultimate actual liability may be higher or lower than reserves established 
our reserves are primarily undiscounted 
we discounted reserves for selected claims that have fixed and determinable future payments  however  at rates ranging from to in and the discount rates in and are subject to change as market interest rates change 
we use the same rates for generally accepted accounting principles as we do for statutory accounting practices in determining our liability 
we also reduce the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses for estimated amounts of subrogation 

table of contents we continually monitor loss development trends and data to establish adequate premium rates and reasonable loss reserve estimates 
loss reserves  which are based on estimates  are inherently uncertain and represent a significant risk to the business that we attempt to mitigate by continually improving and refining our workers compensation claims processing practices and by employing actuarial estimation methods 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses at december  are adequate to cover the ultimate net costs of claim and claim settlement expenses at that date 
the ultimate cost of claim and claim settlement expenses may differ materially from the established reserves  particularly when claims may not be settled for many years 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience

for example  the reserve developed a million net deficiency over the course of the succeeding years 
the net amount has been included in income and the changes have been recorded in the period identified 
the cumulative net deficiencies in and are the result of reserve development inherent in the uncertainty in establishing reserves and anticipated loss trends 
as discussed above  due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  our estimate of the liability for net reserves is difficult and volatile 
as discussed further below  the reserve redundancy in is the result of accrual reversals resulting from changes in methods of assessing second injury funds  lower frequency in claims reported from the estimate at december   and reductions in amounts expected to be incurred for our participation in mandatory state and national assigned risk pools 
in evaluating this information  it should be noted that each amount includes the total of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of redundancy to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency amounts in   and this table does not present accident or policy year development data  which certain readers may be more accustomed to analyzing

table of contents the following table is derived from the loss reserve development table and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the same ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column represent the cumulative reserve re estimate increase decrease for the indicated accident year s cumulative effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operations re estimates for each pre accident year accident year total the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include an million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  and ii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population 
the results include an million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results which include a million increase in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i in march  the minnesota state legislature changed the way the commissioner assessed self insured employers and insurers for estimated liabilities and administrative expenses of the minnesota special compensation fund 
the assessment changed from being paid by the insurer on indemnity payment basis to an assessment charged on premium to the policyholder 
we decreased our recorded accrual to reflect this legislative change  ii the frequency of claims reported in for and prior years was less than anticipated when we determined our liability in  iii we overestimated the liability for our mandatory participation in state and national assigned risk pool operating results for states in which we operate in and reversed that excess in  and iv our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is difficult and volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our operations 
capital resources represent those funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
our primary sources of cash from operations are premiums collected  reimbursements under reinsurance contracts and investment income 
our investment portfolio is also a source of liquidity  through the sale of 
table of contents readily marketable fixed maturity investments 
our primary cash requirements consist of payments for i claim and claim settlement expenses  ii reinsurance  iii policy acquisition costs  iv general and administrative expenses  v capital expenditures  and vi income taxes 
we generate cash from or use cash in operations based on timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
selected reinsurance retention levels also use cash as a result of pre funding premiums under the policies or provide cash upon reimbursement of claim payments 
in and  reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which began in mid and ran off in  offset similar payments to claimants for those years 
this trend will continue in we further expect that cash and investments will remain at levels reported at december in available cash is invested in either short term cash and cash equivalents or longer term available for sale securities pending future payments for such expenses as medical and indemnity benefits and other operating expenses 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and a money market fund that invest primarily in short term government securities 
cash provided by operating activities was million for this is primarily a result of net income of million  a decrease in amounts due from reinsurers of million  a decrease of million in accrued expenses and other liabilities  a million increase in unearned premiums  net of premiums receivable and depreciation expense of million offset by a decrease of million in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and net realized investment gains totaling  net cash provided by investing activities was  due to million in proceeds from sales of securities and million in maturities of investments offset by million in purchases of securities and  in purchases of fixed assets 
net cash used in financing activities was million due primarily to principal payments on our note payable in our need for additional capital is primarily the result of regulations that require certain ratios of regulatory or statutory capital to premiums written in our insurance subsidiary as defined by state regulatory bodies and insurance rating agencies 
raising additional permanent capital  while difficult in the current environment in which we operate  would stabilize our ratio of premium to capital and provide a solid base for the future growth of our insurance subsidiary 
as an alternative to raising additional capital  additional reinsurance would have the effect of reducing the ratio of premiums to capital and may be used to satisfy state regulatory requirements 
state insurance regulations limit distributions  including dividends  from our insurance subsidiary to us 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by acic to us in any year is equal to the greater of i of acic s statutory surplus as of the end of the previous fiscal year  or ii the statutory net gain from operations not including realized capital gains of acic in its most recent fiscal year 
based on this limitation  the maximum dividend that acic could pay to us in  without regulatory approval  is approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acic has never paid a dividend to us and we intend to retain capital in our insurance subsidiary 
on september   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase  from time to time  up to  of rtw  inc common stock 
we repurchased  shares in for approximately   shares in for approximately  and  shares for approximately million through we repurchased these shares on the open market or through private transactions based upon market conditions and availability 
the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock option and purchase plans and other corporate purposes 
at december   investments of million were held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral 
this did not have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we believe that cash flow generated by our operations and our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to fund continuing operations  and capital expenditures for the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist solely of operating leases for our facilities 
future minimum base rental payments required under the leases  as of december   are as follows s interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
we regularly evaluate interest rate risk in order to evaluate the appropriateness of our investments 
an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would reduce the fair value of our interest rate sensitive instruments by approximately million 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term fair value was determined based on commonly used models 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on factors such as duration  prepayments  put options and call options 
fair value was determined based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios 
naic risk based capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital standards to determine the capital requirements of a property and casualty insurance carrier based upon the risks inherent in its operations 
these standards require computing a risk based capital amount that is compared to a carrier s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset risk  insurance underwriting risk  credit risk and off balance sheet risk 
these standards provide for regulatory intervention when the percent of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital is below certain levels 
based upon the risk based capital standards  our percent of total adjusted capital is in excess of authorized control level risk based capital 
regulation our insurance subsidiary is subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies in the states in which we operate  and will be subject to such regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect covered employees and policyholders rather than the insurance company 
both the legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change 
at december   our insurance subsidiary was licensed to do business in minnesota  south dakota  wisconsin  colorado  missouri  illinois  kansas  michigan  indiana  massachusetts  connecticut  rhode island  pennsylvania  tennessee  maryland  arkansas  iowa  florida  georgia  new jersey  north carolina  texas and oklahoma 
in march  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles codification 
codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments and became effective january  statutory accounting principles  however  will continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices 
the state of minnesota required adoption of codification for preparing statutory financial statements for financial periods occurring on or after january  adoption 
table of contents of the codification increased our statutory capital and surplus by approximately million on january  effect of recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no
