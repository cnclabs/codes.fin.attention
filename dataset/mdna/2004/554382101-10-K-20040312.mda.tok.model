item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general background and performance measurement the company uses funds from operations ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted  as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo and ffo on a fully dilutive basis  are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization  as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
ffo on a fully diluted basis  is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ffo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
for the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders  see funds from operations 
in compliance with the securities and exchange commission s registration g and amended item of registration s k relating to non gaap financial measures  the company has revised its ffo definition as of january  and for all periods presented  to include gain or loss or sales of peripheral land  impairment of assets  losses on debt related transactions and the effect of sfas no 
to amortize the market leases which are recorded in minimum rents 
the company s revised definition is in accordance with the definition provided by nareit 
percentage rents generally increase or decrease with changes in tenant sales 
as leases roll over  however  a portion of historical percentage rent is often converted to minimum rent 
it is therefore common for percentage rents to decrease as minimum rents increase 
accordingly  in discussing financial performance  the company combines minimum and percentage rents in order to better measure revenue growth 
the following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the company for the years ended december   and the following discussion compares the activity for the year ended december  to results of operations for the year ended december  also included is a comparison of the activities for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

statement on critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgements on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectable accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight lining of rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for consumer price index cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the macerich company the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin percentage rents are accrued when leasees specified sales targets have been met 
recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
property costs related to the development  redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest incurred or imputed on development  redevelopment and construction projects are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc 
are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate 
property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements initial term of related lease equipment and furnishings years the company accounts for all acquisitions entered into subsequent to june  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a historical basis prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabiltities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i origination value  which represents the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in our markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
origination value is recorded as an other asset and is amortized over the remaining lease terms 
value of in place leases is recorded as an other asset and amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified as an other asset or liability  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases 
the macerich company when the company acquires real estate properties  the company allocates the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties 
depending on the materiality of the acquisition  the company may engage a valuation firm to assist with the allocation 
the company adopted sfas on january  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenants ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize an impairment loss if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
cost relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal 
the present value of leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the range of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal weighted average years present value of leasing commissions and legal costs years off balance sheet arrangements debt guarantees the company has an ownership interest in a number of joint ventures as detailed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein

the results of these acquisitions and the acquisition of biltmore fashion park are reflected in the consolidated results of operations of the company in the income statement line item entitled equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures and the management companies 
many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the westcor portfolio and the and acquisition centers 
for purposes of the financial results  the term westcor portfolio includes the company s acquisition of the remaining interest in flatiron crossing on january  crossroads mall boulder  parklane mall and queens center are currently under redevelopment and are referred to herein as the redevelopment centers

revenues include rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents which requires rent to be recognized each year in an amount equal to the average rent over the term of the lease  including fixed rent increases over that period 
the amount of straight lined rents  included in consolidated revenues  recognized in was million compared to million in and million in additionally  the company recognized through equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures  million as its pro rata share of straight lined rents from joint ventures in compared to million in and million in these variances resulted from the company structuring the majority of its new leases using an annual multiple of cpi increases  which generally do not require straight lining treatment and are offset by increases of million and million relating to the acquisition center  the acquisition of the westcor portfolio and the acquisition center for the years ended december  and  respectively 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
the company s historical growth in revenues  net income and funds from operations have been closely tied to the acquisition and redevelopment of shopping centers 
many factors  including the availability and cost of the macerich company capital  the company s total amount of debt outstanding  interest rates and the availability of attractive acquisition targets  among others  will affect the company s ability to acquire and redevelop additional properties in the future 
the company may not be successful in pursuing acquisition opportunities and newly acquired properties may not perform as well as expected in terms of achieving the anticipated financial and operating results 
increased competition for acquisitions may impact adversely the company s ability to acquire additional properties on favorable terms 
expenses arising from the company s efforts to complete acquisitions  redevelop properties or increase its market penetration may have an adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the following describes some of the other significant factors that may impact the company s future results of operations 
general factors affecting the centers  competition real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk that may affect the ability of the centers to generate sufficient revenues to meet operating and other expenses  including debt service  lease payments  capital expenditures and tenant improvements  and to make distributions to the company and the company s stockholders 
income from shopping center properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the national economic climate  the regional and local economy which may be adversely impacted by plant closings  industry slowdowns  union activities  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  terrorist activities  and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of  or a reduction in demand for  retail space or retail goods and the availability and creditworthiness of current and prospective tenants  perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center  and increased costs of maintenance  insurance and operations including real estate taxes 
a significant percentage of the centers are located in california and the westcor centers are concentrated in arizona 
to the extent that economic or other factors affect california or arizona or their respective regions generally more severely than other areas of the country  the negative impact on the company s economic performance could be significant 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with the centers in attracting tenants to lease space  and an increasing number of new retail formats and technologies other than retail shopping centers that compete with the centers for retail sales see business competition 
increased competition could adversely affect the company s revenues 
income from shopping center properties and shopping center values are also affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax  environmental  safety and zoning laws see business environmental matters  interest rate levels and the availability and cost of financing 
dependence on anchors tenants the company s revenues and funds available for distribution would be adversely affected if a significant number of the company s lessees were unable due to poor operating results  bankruptcy  terrorist activities or other reasons to meet their obligations  if the company were unable to lease a significant amount of space in the centers on economically favorable terms  or if for any reason  the company were unable to collect a significant amount of rental payments 
a decision by an anchor or a significant tenant to cease operations at a center could also have an adverse effect on the company 
in addition  mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  dispositions or bankruptcies in the retail industry could result in the loss of anchors or tenants at one or more centers 
see business bankruptcy and or closure of retail stores 
furthermore  if the store sales of retailers operating in the centers were to decline sufficiently  tenants might be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges 
in the event of a default by a lessee  the center may also experience delays and costs in enforcing its rights as lessor 
the macerich company real estate development risks the company s business strategy has expanded to include the selective development and construction of retail properties 
any development  redevelopment and construction activities that the company undertakes will be subject to the risks of real estate development  including lack of financing  construction delays  environmental requirements  budget overruns  sunk costs and lease up 
furthermore  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
real estate development activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
if any of the above events occur  the ability to pay distributions and service the company s indebtedness could be adversely affected 
joint venture centers the company indirectly owns partial interests in joint venture centers as well as fee title to a site that is ground leased to the entity that owns a joint venture center and several development sites 
the company may also acquire partial interests in additional properties through joint venture arrangements 
investments in joint venture centers involve risks different from those of investments in wholly owned centers 
the company may have fiduciary responsibilities to its partners that could affect decisions concerning the joint venture centers 
in certain cases  third parties share with the company or have with respect to one joint venture center control of major decisions relating to the joint venture centers  including decisions with respect to sales  financings and the timing and amount of additional capital contributions  as well as decisions that could have an adverse impact on the company s reit status 
in addition  some of the company s outside partners control the day to day operations of seven joint venture centers 
the company therefore does not control cash distributions from these centers and the lack of cash distributions from these centers could jeopardize the company s ability to maintain its qualification as a reit 
uninsured losses each of the centers has comprehensive liability  fire  terrorism extended coverage and rental loss insurance with insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
the company does not insure certain types of losses such as losses from wars  because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
in addition  while the company or the relevant joint venture  as applicable  carries earthquake insurance on the centers located in california  the policies are subject to a deductible equal to of the total insured value of each center  a  per occurrence minimum and a combined annual aggregate loss limit of million on these centers 
furthermore  the company carries title insurance on substantially all of the centers for less than their full value 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  the operating partnership or the entity  as the case may be  that owns the affected center could lose its capital invested in the center  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the center  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the center 
there is also no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its current insurance coverage 
an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits may negatively impact the company s financial condition 
reit qualification qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable income tax regulations is greater in the case of a reit such as the company that holds its assets in partnership form 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control  including by the company s partners in the joint venture centers  may affect its ability to qualify as a reit 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative the macerich company interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to the company s qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of that qualification 
if in any taxable year the company fails to qualify as a reit  the company will suffer the following negative results the company will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income  and the company will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  the company will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless the company was entitled to relief under statutory provisions 
as a result  net income and the funds available for distribution to the company s stockholders will be reduced for five years 
it is also possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations might cause the board of directors to revoke the company s reit election 
assets and liabilities total assets increased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  and billion at december  during that same period  total liabilities were billion in and billion in and increased to billion in these changes were primarily a result of the acquisitions and various debt and equity transactions

the company s total outstanding loan indebtedness at december  was billion including its pro rata share of joint venture debt 
this equated to a debt to total market capitalization defined as total debt of the company  including its pro rata share of joint venture debt  plus aggregate market value of outstanding shares of common stock  assuming full conversion of op units and preferred stock into common stock ratio of approximately at december  the majority of the company s debt consists of fixed rate conventional mortgages payable collateralized by individual properties

funds from operations the company uses funds from operations ffo in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers ffo and ffo diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry the macerich company and a supplement to generally accepted accounting principles gaap measures 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
ffo and ffo on a fully diluted basis  are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods 
this is especially true since ffo excludes real estate depreciation and amortization  as the company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight line basis over time 
ffo on a fully diluted basis  is one of the measures investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs 
ffo  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
the reconciliation of ffo and ffo diluted to net income available to common stockholders is provided below 
in compliance with the securities and exchange commission s regulation g and amended item of regulation s k relating to non gaap financial measures  the company has revised its ffo definition as of january  and for all prior periods presented  to include gain or loss on sales of peripheral land  impairment of assets  losses on debt related transactions and the effect of sfas no 
to amortize the below market leases which are recorded in minimum rents 
the company s revised definition is in accordance with the definition provided by nareit

the inclusion of gains losses on sales of peripheral land included in ffo for the years ended december     and were million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
all of these amounts represented amounts from joint ventures at pro rata 
ffo and ffo diluted  for the years ended december         and have been restated to reflect the company s share of impairment of assets and losses on debt related transactions  the latter of which was previously reported as extraordinary items under gaap 
the company s write off of impairment of assets for was million including million from joint ventures at pro rata 
there were no write offs of impairment of assets for the years ended december       or in  the write down from the impairment of a joint venture asset for million has been reflected in ffo for that period

as of december          and million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million and million of op units and westcor partnership units were outstanding  respectively 
the computation of ffo diluted shares outstanding includes the effect of outstanding common stock options and restricted stock using the treasury method 
the convertible debentures were dilutive for the years ended december    and and were included in the ffo calculation 
the convertible debentures were paid off in full on december  on february   the company sold million of its series a preferred stock 
on june   the company sold million of its series b preferred stock 
on september   million shares of series b preferred stock were converted into common shares 
the preferred stock can be converted on a one for one basis for common stock 
the preferred shares are assumed converted for purposes of     and ffo diluted as they are dilutive to that calculation 
the macerich company included in minimum rents were rents attributable to the accounting practice of straight lining of rents 
the amount of straight lining of rents  including the company s pro rata share from joint ventures  that impacted minimum rents was million for  million for  million for  million for and million for the increase in straight lining of rents in and compared to is related to the acquisition of the oaks and the westcor portfolio in these are offset by decreases due to the company structuring its new leases using rent increases tied to the change in cpi rather than using contractually fixed rent increases 
inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  the majority of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above and the implementation of staff accounting bulletin  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter of each year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  reducing interest rate exposure on certain long term variable rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and or swaps with appropriately matching maturities  using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions  and taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long term debt and or equity

the average interest rate decreased from in to in the macerich company see item mortgage debt for additional information on new financing arrangements during the company uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments are effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
for derivative instruments associated with the hedge of an anticipated transaction  hedge effectiveness criteria also require that it be probable that the underlying transaction occurs 
any instrument that meets these hedging criteria is formally designated as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified resulting in some ineffectiveness  the portion of the change in the derivative fair value related to ineffectiveness from period to period will be included in net income 
if any derivative instrument used for risk management does not meet the hedging criteria then it is marked to market each period  however  the company intends for all derivative transactions to meet all the hedge criteria and qualify as hedges 
on an ongoing quarterly basis  the company adjusts its balance sheet to reflect the current fair value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in income or comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedged transaction  and on the type of hedge transaction 
to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged  the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in income 
over time  the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to income 
this reclassification occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in income 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
to determine the fair value of derivative instruments  the company uses standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  and termination cost at each balance sheet date 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
the million variable rate debt maturing in has an interest rate swap agreement which effectively fixed the interest rate at from november to october  the fair value of this swap agreement at december  was the company has an interest rate cap with a notional amount of  on their  loan on the oaks

this cap agreement terminates july  the fair value of this cap agreement at december  was zero 
the company s east mesa land and superstition springs joint venture have an interest rate swap which converts  of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of to a fixed rate of 
this swap has been designated as a hedge in accordance with sfas no 
additionally  interest rate caps were simultaneously sold to offset the effect of the interest rate cap agreements 
these interest rate caps do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas the macerich company in addition  the company has assessed the market risk for its variable rate debt and believes that a increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million per year based on billion outstanding of variable rate debt  excluding the million of debt maturing in  at december  the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated based on discounted cash flows at interest rates that management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration
