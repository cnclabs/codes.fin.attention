item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of storage systems for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add capacity as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete turn key  multi terabyte storage area networks  provides end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our products and services are sold worldwide to end users primarily through our channel partners  including oems  sis and vars 
in may  we entered into a three year oem agreement with sun to provide our storage hardware and software products for private label sales by sun  and that agreement was recently extended until may we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october we continue to develop new products for resale by sun and other channel partners and expect to begin shipping additional new products for resale later this year 
we intend to continue expanding our non oem sales channels through sis and vars in order to decrease our revenue concentration with oems 
as part of our focus on indirect sales channels  we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to third party electronics manufacturing services companies 
outsourcing allows us to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of various manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
we derive net revenue primarily from sales of our sannet ii family of products 
in prior periods  we derived a significant portion of our net revenue from sales of our legacy products and sannet i family of products 
except for two oem customers  one of which continues to buy our sannet i products and the other of which continues to buy a legacy system  we have transitioned all customers to our sannet ii products 
we derive a portion of our net revenue from services associated with the maintenance service we provide for our installed products 
in may  we entered into a services agreement with anacomp  inc to provide all maintenance  warranty and non warranty services for our sannet i and certain legacy products 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions and expenditures for administrative facilities 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of employee severance  lease termination costs and other office closure expenses related to the consolidation of excess facilities 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding shares of chaparral  a privately held storage system provider 
we expect to integrate chaparral s raid controller and router technology into our line of storage products 
we plan to retain chaparral s colorado facility as a research and development hub and to continue to use chaparral s team of engineers and facility support personnel 
in august  box hill systems merged with artecon and we changed our name to dot hill systems corp 
we reincorporated in delaware in our headquarters are located in carlsbad  california  and we maintain international offices in germany  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty cost accruals  revenue recognition  bad debt allowances  long lived assets valuation  intangible assets valuation  income taxes  including deferred income tax asset valuation  litigation and contingencies 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for non software product sales upon transfer of title to the customer 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are also recorded at that time 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally  these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and significantly greater response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar services  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
for software sales  we apply statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses at the time the product is delivered  provided there are no significant obligations related to the sale  the resulting receivable is deemed collectible and there is vendor specific objective evidence supporting the value of the separate contract elements 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered items 
a portion of the arrangement fee equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements  typically software maintenance contracts  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally twelve months 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
a typical arrangement includes a software licensing fee and maintenance agreement 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform periodic valuation assessments based on projected sales forecasts and analyzing upcoming changes in future configurations of our products and record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts  we periodically are faced with uncertainties 
the outcomes of these uncertainties are not within our control  and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and commitments  and consequently  on our operating results 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those forecasted  additional inventory write downs might be required  adversely affecting operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields  and maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money market funds  certificates of deposit  us government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  and type of instrument

as of december   we had no balance under this line 
were we to incur a balance under this line  we would be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not previously undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the future
