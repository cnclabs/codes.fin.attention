item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in september  neurogen has been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
the company has not derived any revenue from product sales and has incurred  and expects to continue to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues 
revenues to date have come from six collaborative research agreements  one license agreement and one technology transfer agreement 
collaborative research agreements have been and are expected to continue to be an important source of funding for the company 
in addition  such arrangements not only drive current revenue through the recognition of upfront and subsequent license fees  research funding and potential milestone payments over the respective contract periods but over the longer term also  potential future product revenues in the form of royalties if the agreements result in successful drug development and commercialization 
the initialization  expiration and specific terms of such agreements have contributed to  and will continue to cause  significant fluctuations in the company s recognized revenues and losses 
in december  the company entered into a collaboration agreement the merck agreement with merck sharp dohme limited merck to discover and develop next generation drugs targeting the vanilloid receptor vr for the treatment of pain 
while the impact of the agreement on results was not significant  it is expected to be a meaningful driver of revenues and liquidity over the next three to five years 
the agreement became effective in late december upon approval by the federal trade commission under the hart scott rodino act 
in january  neurogen received million from merck  including million in up front license fees and another million for the purchase of  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock representing approximately of neurogen s common shares outstanding 
merck will provide neurogen with research funding and license payments totaling million during the initial three year term of the contract subject to merck s right of termination in the third year 
should merck exercise its right to extend the collaborative research program for up to two years  neurogen may also receive further payments of between million and million per year 
in addition  neurogen will be eligible to receive research  development  and approval milestone payments of up to million for the successful commercialization of a collaboration drug for a single therapeutic indication 
beyond that  merck will pay to neurogen royalties on the sale of products from the collaboration 
revenue related to this collaboration will be recognized pursuant to the methodology discussed under the critical accounting policies section below 
drug discovery and development activities  excluding stock compensation charges  have accounted for between and of total expenses over the last three years 
during  the company incurred significant expenses in conducting phase iia exploratory clinical trials in asthma and rheumatoid arthritis for ngd  an oral ca antagonist 
in january  at the conclusion of the asthma trial  the company announced that ngd did not demonstrate a therapeutic benefit for treatment of asthma with respect to the primary predetermined endpoint 
the exploratory phase iia clinical trial using ngd for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is still ongoing 
critical accounting policies the preparation of neurogen s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes estimates in  among others  the areas of revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation and marketable securities and investments 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of neurogen s financial statements revenue recognition each of neurogen s collaborative research  licensing and technology transfer agreements are significant since the terms of such arrangements may cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
the company has entered into collaborative research agreements that provide for the funding of specified projects in exchange for the grant of certain rights related to potential discoveries 
revenue under these arrangements typically includes upfront non refundable fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research and milestone payments upon occurrence of certain events 
since the adoption of sec staff accounting bulletin sab in  the upfront fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the research agreement 
the research funding is recognized as revenue as the related research effort is performed 
revenue derived from the achievement of milestones  each of which represents a substantive stage of development towards a long term goal such as the nomination of a development or clinical candidate or the start of a specific phase of clinical trials or the filing of a new drug application with the food and drug administrat ion  is recognized when the milestone event occurs and collectibility is reasonably certain 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  became effective for all contracts entered into after june  eitf issue no 
addresses  for arrangements with multiple deliverables  how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
under eitf issue no 
 the multiple elements typically included in neurogen s collaborative arrangements as discussed above may not meet the criteria for consideration as separate accounting units and may have to be accounted for as a combined unit 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations in since only one collaborative arrangement  the merck agreemen t  which became effective upon receiving regulatory approval in late december  was entered into after the pronouncement became effective 
revenue recognized from the merck agreement was less than million in the company will review the merck agreement and subsequent collaborative arrangements to determine whether the deliverables included in each arrangement qualify for treatment as separate accounting units 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed when incurred 
stock based compensation neurogen utilizes the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation 
the company primarily grants qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
the company has also issued restricted stock to key executives and records an expense over the vesting periods 
the company accounts for grants of stock options and restricted stock in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognizes no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the company occasionally grants stock option awards to consultants 
such grants are accounted for pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and  accordingly  recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of such awards and amortizes such expense over the performance period 
the fair value of each award is estimated using the black scholes model with certain weighted average assumptions described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities the company invests in us government and corporate debt securities 
the fair value of these securities is subject to volatility and change 
the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale securities as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
marketable securities at each of december  and december  consisted of debt securities with maturities of one month to approximately five years 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses have been determined by the specific identification method and are included in investment income 
different classifications of the company s marketable securities pursuant to sfas no 
would possibly result in material impacts to the valuation of the securities and investment income 
income taxes the liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  is used to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credit carryforwards  and differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations or a charge to additional paid in capital 
long lived assets in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides that a an impairment loss should only be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and b the measurement of impairment loss should be based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
it also provides that a long lived asset or asset group should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment has occurred 
in addition  it provides for the use of probability weighted cash flow est imates in the recoverability test 
neurogen adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  the company will periodically review its long lived assets for potential impairment and recoverability 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future collaborative research agreements  technology transfer agreements or joint ventures  the progress of the company s partnered and unpartnered research and development projects  the size of the company s staff and the level of preclinical and clinical development spending on drug candidates in unpartnered programs 
neurogen believes its research and development costs may increase significantly over the next several years as its drug development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses would be expected to increase to support any expanded research and development activities 
years ended december   and the company s fiscal operating revenues decreased to million from operating revenues of million 
the revenue decrease is due primarily to the completion in of the company s technology transfer agreement with pfizer inc pfizer described below 
license fees decreased from million in to million in due to the recognition in of the final million in license fees earned pursuant to the pfizer technology transfer agreement 
the company recognized million in license fees from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis as part of the aventis agreement described below in both and research revenues increased by to million in from million in due to the recognition of a million milestone payment from aventis upon the successful nomination of a development candidate  offset in part by a million decrease in aventis research funding 
fiscal operating revenues increased to million from operating revenues of million 
the revenue increase consisted of a million increase in license fees and a million increase in research revenues 
the million increase in license fees was due to the recognition of a one time million payment from pfizer to satisfy all remaining obligations related to pfizer s use of the accelerated intelligent drug discovery aidd technology under the technology transfer agreement  a million increase in license fees recognized under the aventis agreement  and an offsetting million decrease in revenue from aidd technology development and improvement services provided to pfizer 
the increase in research revenues was due to a million increase in research revenues from aventis reflecting a full year of research funding under the companies december collaboration agreement offset in part by a million decrease in revenues from pfizer due to the scheduled conclusion in december of the companies joint research collaboration on gamma aminobutyric acid gaba based drugs 
research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  decreased by million or to million in from million in following the implementation of the company s operational excellence program in late which was designed to enhance the efficiency of the company s drug development platform  reduce costs and more closely align the company s investment of resources with long term business goals  the company s research and development related salaries and benefits decreased by million reflecting a reduction in average headcount compared to the prior year and lab supplies decreased by million 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increases in expenses related to the company s exploratory phase iia clinical trials for both asthma and rheumatoid arthritis indications in its ca program  chemical manufacturing and other outsourced research studies associated with the preclinical vr pain program  as well as patent expenses 
research and development expenses of million  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  for fiscal were comparable to million in external development costs related to potential drug candidates decreased from million in to million in  due partly to the assumption by aventis pursuant to the terms of the aventis agreement commencing in december of the costs of developing potential drug candidates for treating depression and anxiety disorders 
this decrease was offset by an overall increase in the company s ongoing investment in scientific personnel and research supplies 
research and development expenses represented  and of total operating expenses excluding non cash stock compensation charges for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
while the company maintains a system to record the level of staffing time spent on each of its research and development projects  it does not maintain a historical cost accounting system with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate its research and development costs on a specific project by project basis 
a significant portion of the company s research and development expenses such as laboratory supplies  travel  information systems and services and facilities costs benefit multiple projects and are not individually tracked to a specific project 
further  the company s staff timekeeping system does not account for differences in compensation costs between lower level technicians and more senior scientists 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  decreased by to million in as compared to million in and million in the decrease is primarily due to million lower legal expenses in as the company incurred higher legal expenses in in connection with the filing of a shelf registration  million lower salaries and benefits due to an reduction in average headcount compared to the prior year  and million lower investor relations expenses  offset by a million increase in insurance costs 
total stock compensation expenses were million in compared to million in and million in both the and stock compensation expenses are primarily composed of continuing non cash charges for grants of certain stock awards in  and to certain officers of the company 
the expense included non cash charges to income for grants of certain stock awards in and  as well as one time non cash charges totaling million for the modification of certain stock options held by two executive officers 
a portion of the stock compensation charges those relating to the awards is variable and as a result may fluctuate significantly in the future 
other income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in is due to reduced investment income caused by a decline in average cash and marketable securities and lower overall returns on invested funds  partially mitigated by a decrease in interest expense resulting from lower outstanding loan balances 
the decrease in from was driven by an increase in interest expense of million following a million first mortgage debt financing entered into in december and a decrease in investment income  reflecting both lower average cash and marketable securities balances and lower overall returns on invested funds 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized connecticut income tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively  in the statement of operations 
the company recorded total income tax benefits of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  a portion of which related to employee stock options and was recorded to additional paid in capital 
the benefits are the result of connecticut legislation which allowed the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
the company recognized a net loss of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss was primarily due to an million decrease in operating revenues 
the decrease in the net loss from the level was primarily due to the increase in operating revenues 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate were million and million  respectively 
at december   million of the marketable securities have maturities greater than one year 
however  the company can and may liquidate such investments prior to maturity to meet its operating needs and strategic and or investment objectives 
the company s cash and other short term investment levels decreased progressively throughout to fund operating expenses as well as million in annual principal repayments on outstanding loans described below 
the ending level of cash and marketable securities also reflected the receipt of million in research funding  million in proceeds from stock option exercises  and million in income tax benefits from the state of connecticut described herein 
under the terms of the merck agreement in december  the company received million from merck in january  including million in up front license fees and another million for the purchase of  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock representing approximately of neurogen s common shares outstanding 
the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future as a result of the factors described below 
the company plans to use its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for its research and development activities  working capital and general corporate purposes 
neurogen s cash requirements to date have been met by the proceeds of its equity financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative research  licensing or technology transfer arrangements  certain debt arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
the company s equity financing activities have included underwritten public offerings of common stock  private placement offerings of common stock and private sales of common stock in connection with collaborative research and licensing agreements 
to date  total funding received from these financing activities was approximately million 
the company s expenditures were primarily to fund research and development and general and administrative expenses and to construct and equip its research and development facilities 
the company is in the early stage of product development 
the company has not derived any product revenues from product sales and does not expect to derive any product revenues for at least the next several years  if at all 
prior to deriving any such product revenues  the company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows that in the aggregate could exceed the company s existing cash resources 
to provide cash to fund its operations until such time as it achieves sustainable revenues  the company relies extensively on its ability to develop drug discovery programs of sufficient value to either partner the programs with pharmaceutical companies or raise capital through equity financings 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s currently unpartnered programs  such as its program for the treatment of inflammatory disorders or earlier stage programs  such progress could lead to the opportunity to partner on terms which provide capital  revenues and cash flows to the company or the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if unpartnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s partnered programs  such as the company s insomnia program partnered with pfizer or its depression and anxiety program partnered with aventis or the pain program partnered with merck  such progress could result in milestone payments and additional research and development funding to the company under the respective collaboration agreements 
such progress could also provide the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if partnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
the company does not have control over the progress of partnered programs 
lack of progress  scheduling delays or failures in any of the company s major programs could significantly reduce the company s levels of revenues  cash flows and cash available to fund its business 
it could also significantly increase the company s cost of capital and limit its ability to raise equity capital 
all of the company s compounds in development  whether in human clinical trials or not  will require significant additional research  development and testing before they can be commercialized 
furthermore  the scope  magnitude and timing of future research and development expenses  as well as anticipated project completion dates  are a series of steps  ranging from preclinical testing to clinical studies in humans 
each step in the process is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and cost for completion depends on the specific progress of each product being tested 
while the company cannot accurately predict the time required or the cost involved in commercializing any one of its candidates  new drug development typically takes many years and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 
in addition  developing new drugs is an extremely uncertain process where most candidates fail and uncertain developments such as clinical or regulatory delays  side effects  undesirable drug properties or ineffectiveness of a drug candidate would slow or prevent the development of a product 
if neurogen or its partners are unable to commercialize one or more of our drug products  the company may never achieve product revenues and may eventually be unable to continue our operations 
this result would cause our shareholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 
the debt agreements entered into by the company to date include the commercial term mortgage loan financing in december with webster bank  and a construction loan entered into in october with connecticut innovations  inc cii 
total proceeds received under these agreements were million  which are repayable through monthly installments over a maximum term of years  bearing various interest rates  which approximated from through of these amounts received  million and remained outstanding as of december  under the webster bank facility and the cii facility  respectively 
an approximate aggregate amount of million is due and payable in each of the next five years  excluding the march payment described below 
thereafter  approximately million is payable in regular installments until the scheduled maturity dates  including a balloon payment of million on the mortgage loan upon maturity in december the loan with cii contains certain subjective acceleration clauses  which upon occurrence of certain events may cause amounts due under the agreement to become immediately due and payable 
the company has no indication that it is in default of any such clauses and therefore has classified its debt based on the dates regular payments are due 
as of december   neurogen is not engaged in any significant lease or capital expenditure commitments 
under the original terms of the webster bank facility agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants  including a requirement that the company maintain at least million in cash and marketable securities and that the ratio of the outstanding loan balance less any cash collateral to the appraised value of the real property loan to value ratio  as periodically determined by the bank in its sole but reasonable discretion  will not exceed 
in the second quarter of  the company received notice from the bank asserting that this ratio exceeded 
neurogen was informed by the bank that it was using a different standard in calculating the company s compliance with this covenant than that used when neurogen and the bank entered into the loan agreement and that federal regulations required the bank to use this different standard 
in the third quarter  the company and the bank agreed to amend the loan to value ratio from to  and the company agreed to and did pay million of the loan balance  in addition to the previously scheduled loan repayments 
in january of the company was notified by webster bank that another appraisal was received by the bank which indicated that the value of the property had declined 
after discussions with the bank  the company agreed to and did pay down the balance of the principal by million in march in exchange for amending the loan agreement to remove the loan to value covenant mentioned above 
therefore  the company has classified an additional million to short term debt as of december  for the payment made in march as of december  the company believes it is in compliance with all loan covenants 
following notification from webster bank of the lower appraised value of its property  the company reviewed the carrying value of its buildings and improvements for possible impairment and recoverability pursuant to sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
based on the company s estimated future cash flows for the remaining useful lives of the building and improvements  the company concluded that the carrying value of the assets was recoverable as defined by sfas therefore  it was unnecessary to record an impairment loss or adjust the carrying value of the company s building and improvements 
in october  as a part of its operational excellence program  neurogen reorganized certain departments and eliminated employee positions  representing approximately of its total workforce 
the company recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of for employee termination costs  such as severance pay  continuation of benefits and personal outplacement support 
all accrued charges under this program have been paid out 
neurogen anticipates that under the restructured operating program  its current cash balance  as supplemented by research funding pursuant to its collaborative research agreements with aventis and merck  will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations into the second quarter of however  neurogen s funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of the company s research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its proposed products  the status of competitive products and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  manufacturing and marketing products 
many of these factors could significantly increase the company s expenses and use of cash 
the company anticipates that it may augment its cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities and further corporate alliances 
no assurances can be given that adequate levels of additional financing can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
the company has filed an s registration statement which became effective in february  which provided the company the opportunity to issue debt  common or preferred stock or warrants of up to million in total financing of common stock under the shelf registration statement 
in january  the company issued  shares to merck for million in cash consideration in conjunction with signing the vr collaboration agreement discussed below 
as of december   the company had approximately million and million of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards  respectively  available for federal income tax purposes  which expire in the years through the company also had approximately million of connecticut state tax net operating loss carryforwards which expire in the years through  million of connecticut state incremental research and development credit carryforwards which expire in the years through and million of connecticut non incremental research and development credit carryforwards with an unlimited carryforward period 
the company applied to exchange  and connecticut research and development credits for cash proceeds under connecticut tax law provisions effective at that time as mentioned above  resulting in the receipt of a million from the state of connecticut in and million in relating to the exchange of the and research and development credits 
because of change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  the company s utilization of its net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods 
the following table sets forth a summary of the company s commitments as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt total the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
collaborative research agreements in december  neurogen entered into a collaboration agreement with merck to research  develop  and commercialize small molecule medicines which work by targeting the vanilloid receptor vr  a key integrator of pain signals in the nervous system 
in january under the terms of the agreement the company received from merck a payment of million for license fees and sold to merck  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock for an additional million 
merck has agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for three years for the company s program for the discovery and research and to pay additional license fees on the first three anniversary dates of the collaboration 
merck has the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional two years or to terminate the agreement after two years and transfer certain rights to the collaborative program to neurogen 
the company is eligible to receive milestone payments if certain compound discovery  product development or regulatory objectives are achieved through the collaboration 
also under the agreement  merck is responsible for funding the cost of development  including clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of collaboration products  if any 
merck will pay neurogen royalties based upon net sales levels  if any  for collaboration products 
in december  neurogen entered into a collaboration and license agreement with aventis the aventis agreement  pursuant to which aventis made an initial payment of million and agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for three years for neurogen s program for the discovery and research of crf receptor based drugs for a broad range of applications  including the therapeutic treatment of depression and anxiety disorders 
aventis has the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional two years or terminate the collaboration prior to its scheduled conclusion and transfer all rights to the collaborative program to neurogen 
as of december   the company has received million of research funding from aventis 
neurogen is also eligible to receive milestone payments if certain compound discovery  product development or regulatory objectives are achieved through the collaboration 
in return  aventis received the exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture and market collaboration drugs that act through the crf receptor  for all therapeutic indications for which the drugs may be used 
aventis will pay neurogen royalties based upon net sales levels  if any  for collaboration products 
also under the agreement  aventis is responsible for funding the cost of development  including clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of collaboration products  if any 
in december  due to progress in the collaboration  neurogen achieved a preclinical milestone that triggered a payment of million  which was received in january in june  neurogen and pfizer entered into the pfizer technology transfer agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  pfizer agreed to pay neurogen up to a total of million over a three year period for the licensing and transfer to pfizer of certain of neurogen s aidd technologies for the discovery of new drugs  along with the installation of an aidd system 
additional payments were also possible upon pfizer s successful utilization of this technology 
pfizer received a non exclusive license to certain aidd intellectual property and the right to employ this technology in its own drug discovery programs 
as of december   pfizer had provided million pursuant to the pfizer technology transfer agreement  which terminated on schedule in june  and  therefore  no additional fees were received in total fees include a million one time payment in december to satisfy all obligations from pfizer s use of the aidd technology 
in  neurogen and pfizer entered into a collaborative research agreement the pfizer agreement pursuant to which pfizer made a million equity investment in the company and agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for up to four years later extended to december for neurogen s research program for the development of gaba based drugs for the treatment of sleep disorders 
in return  pfizer received the exclusive worldwide license to manufacture  use and sell gaba based sleep disorder products developed in the collaboration 
pfizer is currently evaluating a lead candidate ngd from this collaboration in phase i studies and evaluating other candidates from the program to determine whether further development is desirable 
pfizer has the right to determine when to advance compounds in the clinical process  and the company will receive milestone payments if specified development and regulatory objectives are achieved 
in addition  pfizer is required to pay the company royalties based on net sales levels  if any  for such products 
neurogen has initiated discussions with pfizer to explore various options to advance the clinical development of ngd recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses  for arrangements with multiple deliverables  how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf issue no 
is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  under eitf issue no 
 the multiple elements typically included in neurogen s collaborative arrangements such as upfront license fees  annual license maintenance fees  research funding  and milestone payments may not meet the criteria for consideration as separate accounting units and may have to be accounted for as a combined unit 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on the company s results of operatio ns in since only one collaborative arrangement  the merck agreement  which became effective upon receiving regulatory approval in late december  was entered into after the pronouncement became effective 
revenue recognized from the merck agreement was less than million in the company will review the merck agreement and subsequent collaborative arrangements to determine whether the deliverables included in each arrangement qualify for treatment as separate accounting units 
in december  the sec released sab no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  funds available from investment activities are dependent upon available investment rates 
these funds may be higher or lower than anticipated due to interest rate volatility 
capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through further equity offerings 
the ability of the company to raise funds in this manner is dependent upon capital market forces affecting the stock price of the company
