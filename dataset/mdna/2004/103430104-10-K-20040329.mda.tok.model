item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion surrounding the results of the hotels operations 

table of contents application of business strategies maximizing operating cash flow aggressive asset management we closely monitor revenue generation  including rates  group pacing and yield management  and suggest improvements to managers initiatives to improve hotel performance 
we also utilize the smith travel research reports to evaluate the performance of each of our hotels relative to their competitive set the hotels in their market that compete for the same business 
we work closely with all of the respective management companies to manage and improve cost control initiatives 
reinvestment in hotel properties we believe that our regular program of capital improvements at our hotels  including replacement and refurbishment of furniture  fixtures  and equipment  helps maintain and enhance their competitiveness and maximizes their profitability 
consistent with this strategy  we have made significant renovations at several of our hotels in recent years 
in  and we spent million  million and million  respectively  on renovations  excluding the redevelopment of our pink shell beach resort and the major renovation projects at the chicago  illinois and lyndhurst  new jersey hotels which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures 
this represented  and of  and consolidated hotel revenues  respectively 
strategic brand positioning we maximize our market share and revenue by taking advantage of our sales and marketing orientation to identify the most effective branding strategy for each hotel and to further leverage the selected brands with effective direct sales strategies 
factors we consider in determining the most effective branding strategy are brand strengths and their current presence in the specific market  expected contribution to revenues  expected capital requirements and ongoing costs of the franchise  and strengthening strategic franchisor relationships 
in certain circumstances  we have concluded that operating a hotel independent of a franchise affiliation is the best branding strategy 
such is the case with the french lick springs resort and spa in french lick  indiana  hotel in chicago  illinois  and our pink shell beach resort in ft 
myers beach  florida  which became an independent property late in the remainder of our portfolio contains properties that are currently operated under franchise license agreements with premier nationally recognized hotel chains including  but not limited to  doubletree  marriott  radisson  hilton  embassy suites  holiday inn  hampton inn and quality suites 
initiatives to enhance returns on hotels iacc ancillary conference centers we have identified a strategic opportunity to enhance the revenue streams from certain of our existing hotels by developing ancillary conference centers meeting iacc standards within those hotels 
each conference center is a business unit inside an existing full service hotel  designed to complement the existing transient and group business 
the conference center strategy is attractive to us because it creates demand for our guest and meeting rooms from a new client base  those who prefer to hold meetings at conference centers that meet iacc standards or who otherwise need the types of services provided at iacc conference centers 
iacc requires facilities to meet certain technical standards regarding technology  telecommunications  lighting  sound transmission and other items  which standards appeal particularly to corporate and institutional training programs 
further  the 
table of contents conference center services and pricing are designed on a complete meeting package basis  meaning that the users pay a fixed daily price per person on an all inclusive basis rooms  meals  breaks  telephone services  etc  regardless of utilization  thus making the cost of the services predictable for the planner and the hotel 
the benefit of this pricing structure to us is that we anticipate a higher revpor  meaning revenue per occupied room  because these guests purchase meals and other services at the hotel as a part of their packages 
additionally  we expect higher operating margins from this business because predictable utilization of these services results in the achievement of greater operational efficiency 
during  we completed such centers at our berkeley and omaha properties and construction is underway at our third target property  our portland lloyd center hotel 
property redevelopment and expansion we are undertaking a series of projects at our pink shell beach resort in ft 
myers beach  florida to elevate this resort s position to a four star level and to take advantage of the opportunity to sell portions of the property while retaining long term cash flow 
in  we completed a million renovation of the sanibel view villas  a unit tower  which we sold as condominium units 
the units were sold with the prospect that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract 
each buyer of a unit in the sanibel view building put their unit back to us for use as a hotel room 
therefore  in addition to the cash flow generated from selling the units  we receive continuing income from the units placed in the rental program 
during  we demolished and removed cottages to commence construction of a new unit tower  the white sand villas 
the units within the new tower are also being sold as condominium units with the prospect that the owners will also put their unit back to us for use as hotel rooms 
the tower is scheduled to open in march  and similar to sanibel view  all prospective buyers have signed agreements to allow us to use their units as hotel rooms 
the final stage of the redevelopment of the property  the captiva villas  is currently in the design and marketing phase 
two low rise buildings at the property are currently scheduled for demolition after the florida peak season and will be replaced with a new unit tower called captiva villas 
again  the new building will be sold as condominium units 
during  we also completed the guestroom renovation of hotel in downtown chicago converting it into a four star independent hotel and the renovation and conversion of the lyndhurst  new jersey property to a courtyard by marriott 
managing our hotel portfolio mix acquiring upscale commercial and resort hotels in key markets our acquisition criteria focuses on hotels in the upper upscale and upscale segments located in major metropolitan markets and destination beach markets 
these markets have historically outperformed other markets because of their high barriers to entry and diversified demand generators 
our current major metropolitan targets include san francisco  boston  new york  washington  dc and los angeles 
our success in implementing this strategy is illustrated by our most recent acquisition  the radisson suite beach resort on marco island  florida 
prior to marco island  our other recent acquisitions consisted of the meadowlands lyndhurst courtyard by marriott in the new york city metropolitan area and hotel in chicago 
funds for future acquisitions or development of hotels are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from capital obtained from borrowings  from the proceeds of the sale of non strategic hotels  from additional issuances of common shares  preferred shares  or other securities  from potential joint venture partners and from cash flows from operations 
disposing of assets to provide capital for better investment opportunities we intend to sell assets that we believe have lower long term growth prospects because of physical characteristics or market location 
due to our efforts in marketing certain of the properties and modifying our loans  in we were able to complete the sale of five assets which we defined as suburban hotels that are not located within our target markets 
those properties included the knoxville hilton  the hampton inn lake 
table of contents norman  the holiday inn lake norman  and our doubletree hotels in springfield  oregon and spokane  washington 
gross proceeds from the sale of these assets totaled approximately million 
we intend to maintain a geographically diversified hotel portfolio and may also cluster hotels within certain primary markets in order to take advantage of operational and managerial economies of scale 
we will acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless adequate sources of capital and financing are available and the properties are priced attractively 
optimizing our capital structure and improving financial flexibility managing our leverage and debt service coverage ratios our goal is to maximize shareholder value by strategically using debt and other fixed income instruments  such as preferred equity  to enhance return on common equity while appropriately managing financial risk 
we successfully completed a million offering of preferred depositary shares in october  the net proceeds of which were used to pay down our indebtedness 
expanding our capital sources we are focused on enhancing our capital structure by diversifying our capital sources 
traditionally  we have utilized secured debt  common equity and joint venture equity to finance our capital needs 
we intend to broaden our sources of capital through increasing our use of alternative sources of debt and equity 
for example  we are financing the construction of white sand villas through a construction loan and we issued preferred stock in for which the proceeds were used to repay outstanding amounts of the previously existing secured credit facility and portions of term notes 
we will continue to evaluate the use of other financing structures  such as unsecured debt and convertible securities  relative to our goal of improving financial flexibility and achieving an attractive cost of capital 
when using secured debt which minimizes financing costs  we will seek enhanced flexibility in terms of refinancing options and the ability to allow for substitutions of collateral to facilitate sales of properties 
strategically utilizing joint venture equity the use of joint ventures allows us to further leverage our capital 
we will use joint ventures in instances in which it is strategically advantageous  or to invest in hotels larger than we would consider appropriate for us to acquire without a co venturer in light of the size of our capital base and leverage ratios 
we currently own five hotels in joint venture structures 
our joint venture partners manage three of the hotels and two are managed by bmc 
hotel managers in selecting operators  we seek hotel managers with demonstrated full service hotel expertise  a stable operating and financial performance history and an excellent reputation in the hospitality industry

table of contents risk factors if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not discussed herein may also impair our operations 
risks related to the hotel industry public reaction to acts of terrorism or military action could affect our cash flow 
we are subject to disruptions in the lodging industry that would likely result from terrorist attacks actual or threatened or military action affecting the united states 
the uncertainty that would result from these events would likely increase the public s reluctance to travel  which could adversely affect our operations 
competition  economic conditions and similar factors affecting us and the hotel industry generally could affect our performance 
our hotels are subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests from other hotels based upon brand affiliations  room rates offered including those via internet wholesalers and distributors  customer service  location and the condition and upkeep of each hotel in general and in relation to other hotels in their local market  adverse effects of general and local economic conditions  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter travel  impact of financial difficulties of the airline industry and potential reduction in service on the demand for our hotel rooms and the collectibility of our outstanding receivables from the airlines  increases in operating costs attributable to inflation and other factors  and overbuilding in the hotel industry  especially in individual markets 
the need to make unexpected capital expenditures could adversely affect our cash flow 
hotels require ongoing renovations and other capital improvements  including periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
if necessary capital expenditures exceed expectations  there can be no assurance that sufficient sources of financing will be available to fund such expenditures 
we may also acquire hotels in the future that require significant renovation 
hotel investments are generally illiquid  and we may not be able to sell our hotels when it is economically advantageous to do so 
hotel investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in accordance with our strategies or in response to economic or other conditions 
in addition  provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  limit a reit s ability to sell its properties in some situations when it may be economically advantageous to do so 
risks related to our operations the profitability of our hotels depends on the performance of the hotel management companies 
the profitability of our hotels depends largely upon the ability of the management companies to generate revenues at our hotels in excess of their operating expenses 
the failure of the management companies to manage the hotels effectively would adversely affect our cash flow received from hotel operations 
before january   our cash flow consisted primarily of lease payments from lessees 
our lessees were legally bound to make minimum lease payments even when such payments exceeded the cash flow from the hotel 
since implementing our taxable reit subsidiary trs structure on january   the responsibility and risks associated with making the minimum lease payments has shifted to lessees owned by the partnership 
therefore  we have effectively assumed the risks associated with operating shortfalls at our hotels operating under the trs structure 
our performance is dependent upon the performance of bmc 
bmc currently manages of our hotels 
we are therefore dependent to a large degree on the operating performance of bmc 
bmc has expanded in the past 
table of contents months  with the total number of hotels under its management increasing from to during that period 
we cannot provide assurance that bmc will successfully manage the increasing demands that its growth imposes on its management  administrative  operating and financial resources 
changes in management at these hotels or at other hotels in the future could result in temporary service disruptions at the affected hotels  which could in turn affect their operating and financial performance 
we are subject to conflicts of interest involving our chairman and chief executive officer 
our chairman and chief executive officer  robert w 
boykin  and his brother  john e 
boykin  own bmc and therefore derive benefits from bmc s management of of our hotels 
accordingly  mr 
boykin has and will continue to have conflicts of interest with us 
he had conflicts of interest in connection with our january trs transaction and in connection with the structuring of the management agreements for the hotels currently managed by bmc 
he will have similar conflicts on renewal of those agreements and in connection with future management agreements and other transactions that we may enter into with bmc 
conflicts of interest may also arise in connection with bmc s management of our hotels 
under certain circumstances  actions taken and decisions made by bmc to maximize its profits will not necessarily benefit us 
additionally  a subsidiary of bmc provides design services to us for a fee and also receives a portion of the fees we pay to an independent purchasing agent 
mr 
boykin may have conflicts of interest with respect to our procurement of design services and capital goods 
additionally  the sale of certain of our hotels may result in different and more adverse tax consequences to mr 
boykin than would be experienced by boykin and our public shareholders  and he could seek to influence us not to sell a hotel even though that sale might otherwise be financially advantageous to us and our public shareholders 
our articles of incorporation provide that our independent directors are to make all determinations to be made on our behalf with respect to the relationships or opportunities that represent a conflict of interest for any of our officers or directors 
the covenants in our credit agreements may restrict our range of operating activities  and we are subject to refinancing risks 
we have a senior secured credit facility that enables us to borrow up to million based upon borrowing base availability and term loans with original balances of million and million  respectively  each of which is secured by certain of our hotel properties 
our secured credit facility requires us  among other things  to maintain a minimum net worth  a coverage ratio of ebitda to debt service  a coverage ratio of ebitda to debt service and fixed charges  and a maximum leverage ratio  and places limitations on our common share distributions and acquisitions 
in addition  our secured loans limit our ability to sell certain hotel properties 
these credit arrangements may limit our ability to sell certain hotels whose disposition might be desirable for strategic or financial purposes 
the initial term of the million term loan expired in july  however  management utilized the first of the two one year extension options available under the terms of the agreement  therefore the current maturity date is july the only other debt maturities scheduled for are the mortgages related the hotels owned by our two unconsolidated joint ventures 
a one year extension option related to one of the mortgages has already been utilized and management intends to refinance the other mortgage upon its maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our credit arrangements upon maturity on favorable terms or at all 
further  if we are unable to make payments on or to refinance indebtedness secured by our properties  the properties could be foreclosed upon with a consequent loss to us of income and asset value 
a portion of our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate  as may other indebtedness we incur in the future 
accordingly  increases in market interest rates could increase our debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our cash flow 
we are subject to risks associated with development  redevelopment and acquisitions of hotels 
new and continued development projects and hotel acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including the availability of acceptable financing  competition with other entities for investment opportunities  acquired properties failure to achieve anticipated operating results  construction costs of a property exceeding original estimates  
table of contents delays in construction and renovation projects  overruns with respect to the cost of improvements to bring acquired properties to the requisite standards  and the expenditure of funds on  and the devotion of management time to  transactions that may not come to fruition 
we are subject to the risks associated with investments through joint ventures 
three of our consolidated hotels are owned by joint ventures in which we have controlling interests 
we may enter into similar joint ventures in the future 
any joint venture investment involves risks such as the possibility that the co venturer may seek relief under federal or state insolvency laws  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals 
while the bankruptcy or insolvency of our co venturer generally should not disrupt the operations of the joint venture  we could be forced to purchase the co venturer s interest in the joint venture or the interest could be sold to a third party 
additionally  we have joint ventures in which we have non controlling interests and we may enter into similar joint ventures in the future 
if we do not have control over a joint venture  the value of our investment may be affected adversely by a third party that may have different goals and capabilities than ours 
it may also be difficult for us to exit a joint venture that we do not control after an impasse 
in addition  a joint venture partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations and we may be required to or find it necessary to fulfill those obligations 
obligations imposed by our franchise agreements could affect us adversely 
most of our hotels are subject to franchise or license agreements 
the continuation of a franchise or license agreement is generally subject to specified operating standards 
action or inaction on our part or by any of our hotel managers could result in our failure to meet those standards  which could result in the loss of the franchise 
a franchisor also could condition the continuation of a franchise on the completion of capital improvements that we determine are too expensive or otherwise unwarranted in light of general economic conditions or the operating results or prospects of the affected hotel 
in that event  we may elect to allow the franchise agreement to lapse 
in any case  the loss of a franchise agreement could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the agreement because of the loss of associated name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor  or because of penalties payable upon early termination of the agreement 
additionally  the franchise agreements may place restrictions on the transfer or sale of assets or make such transfers or sales economically infeasible 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover certain risks 
we continue to carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  earthquake  terrorism and business interruption policies that insure us against losses within policy specification and insurance limits that we believe are reasonable 
there are certain types of risks  generally of a catastrophic nature  that may be uninsurable or are not economically insurable or certain coverages that we currently carry may become uneconomical or unavailable in the future 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose our investment in the affected hotel as well as the anticipated future cash flow from that hotel  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to that hotel 
the costs of complying with laws and regulations could adversely affect our cash flow 
our hotels must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that they are public accommodations or commercial facilities as defined in the ada 
noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
if changes in these laws involve substantial expenditures or must be made on an accelerated basis  our cash flow could be adversely affected 
under various federal  state and local laws  an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in the property 
this liability may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the substances 
other laws impose on owners and operators certain requirements regarding conditions and activities that may affect human health or the environment 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could complicate our ability to operate or sell an affected property and could subject us to monetary penalties  costs required to achieve compliance and potential liability to third parties 
we may be potentially liable for such costs 
table of contents or claims in connection with the ownership and operation of our current hotels and hotels we may acquire in the future 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority of  nor are we aware of  any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our hotels 
nonetheless  it is possible that material environmental contamination or conditions exist  or could arise in the future  in the hotels or on the land upon which they are located 
we anticipate that we will incur additional costs for systems  staffing and third party services in maintaining compliance with new federal laws and regulations addressing corporate governance issues and with the new listing requirements of the new york stock exchange 
we bear the risk factors common to real estate development as a result of our projects at the pink shell beach resort 
common risk factors related to development include  but are not limited to competition from other condominium projects  construction delays due to weather  reliance on contractors and subcontractors  construction cost overruns  the ability of condominium purchasers to secure financing and completion of the development in accordance with our agreements 
employees as of march   we had employees

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview boykin lodging company boykin  an ohio corporation  is a real estate investment trust reit that was formed and completed an initial public offering in to continue and expand the nearly year history of hotel ownership  acquisition  redevelopment and repositioning activities of its predecessors  boykin management company and its affiliates 
boykin hotel properties  lp  an ohio limited partnership the partnership  is the operating partnership that transacts business and holds the direct and indirect ownership interests in boykin s hotels 
as of march   boykin has an ownership interest in  is the sole general partner of and does all its business through the partnership 
since our initial public offering  we have expanded our portfolio by using capital raised through a combination of common share issuances  various debt financings  capital from strategic joint venture partners and cash flow generated from operations 
at the end of  we owned interests in hotels containing a total of  guestrooms located in different states 
during march  our doubletree portland downtown property was acquired by the city of portland through its powers of eminent domain 
therefore  as of march   we own interests in hotels containing  guestrooms 
critical accounting policies the critical accounting policies which we believe are the most significant to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results include the following investment in hotel properties hotel properties are stated at cost  net of any impairment charges  and are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from ten to years for buildings and improvements and three to years for furniture and equipment 
we review our hotel properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the hotel properties may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at the properties due to declining national or local economic conditions  new hotel construction in markets where the hotels are located or changes in the expected holding period of the property 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of a hotel property are equal to or exceed its carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount to the related hotel property s estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
in  we recorded a charge of million for impairment of real estate on one hotel  our holiday inn minneapolis west  as a result of a change in management s intended holding period of the property 
pursuant to the terms of the joint venture which owns the property  over of this charge was allocable to the joint venture s minority interest partner 
there were no charges recorded for impairment of real estate in in we recorded charges of million for impairment of real estate on the carrying value of several hotels due to their book value exceeding their fair value 
approximately million of these charges related to four properties which we sold during as of december   we did not believe that there were any factors or circumstances indicating impairment of any other of our investments in hotel properties 

table of contents we estimate the fair market values of our properties through a combination of comparable property sales  replacement cost and cash flow analysis taking into account each property s expected cash flow generated from operations  holding period and ultimate proceeds from disposition 
in projecting the expected cash flows from operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future projected earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and deduct expected capital expenditure requirements 
we then apply growth assumptions to project these amounts over the expected holding period of the asset 
our growth assumptions are based on estimated changes in room rates and expenses and the demand for lodging at our properties  as impacted by local and national economic conditions and estimated or known future new hotel supply 
the estimated proceeds from disposition are judgmentally determined based on a combination of anticipated cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal capitalization rate  ratio of selling price to gross hotel revenues and selling price per room 
if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s future operations and fair market value could be significantly different from the estimated results and value used in our analysis 
our operating results are also subject to the risks set forth under items c and of this form k 
revenue recognition hotel revenues hotel revenues  including room  food  beverage and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are delivered 
ongoing credit evaluations are performed and an allowance for potential credit losses is provided against the portion of accounts receivable that is estimated to be uncollectible

in  revenue was recognized under percentage of completion accounting as the project had satisfied the criteria outlined above 
percentage of completion accounting involves the use of estimates for the relation of revenues on sold units to total revenues of the project and for total cost of the project 
the profit realized on the white sand villas could change if actual sales prices differ from current estimates and if estimated costs change due to a change in scope or scheduling of the project or other factors 
sales of condominium units during  we completed a renovation of a unit tower at the pink shell beach resort

dividends were also declared and paid for the fourth quarter and first quarter at the same level to ensure that we distributed enough to maintain our reit status 
while we are committed to a philosophy of regular quarterly dividends  the current economic and geopolitical environment make it advisable to retain cash in order to enhance our liquidity going forward 
pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  we are limited to distributing not more than of ffo attributable to common shareholders and only if the outstanding balance has been reduced to million 
the credit facility does not limit distributions to preferred shareholders or distributions required for us to maintain our reit status 
currently  we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend on our preferred shares 
the resumption of a common dividend will depend upon the improving performance of our hotels and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant 
in  we expect to spend approximately million related to capital expenditures at our consolidated hotels  excluding the pink shell beach resort projects discussed below 
this amount includes planned refurbishments and replacements at selected existing hotels as well as revenue generating projects  such as the development of ancillary conference centers within certain properties

with regard to the planned captiva villas project  similar to sanibel view villas and white sand villas  the units in the tower will be sold as condominiums  with the prospect that the owners would put their unused room nights back to the resort by contract  which will provide us with continuing income 
the captiva villas tower is scheduled for completion during we are currently talking to various lenders regarding our financing options for the construction of captiva villas 
we have considered our short term defined as one year or less liquidity needs and the adequacy of our estimated cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we expect our principal short term liquidity needs will be to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements  distributions on the preferred shares and any minimum distribution required to maintain our reit status 
we anticipate that these needs will be met with cash flows provided by operating activities  using availability under the credit facility  proceeds from sales of condominium units  proceeds from dispositions of non core assets and proceeds from potential additional financings 
we also consider capital improvements and property acquisitions as short term needs that can be funded either with cash flows provided by operating activities  by utilizing availability under our credit facility  or from proceeds from additional financings 
we expect to meet long term defined as greater than one year liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  development projects and other nonrecurring capital improvements utilizing cash flow from operations  proceeds from dispositions of non core assets  additional debt financings and preferred or common equity offerings 
we expect to acquire or develop additional hotel properties only as suitable opportunities arise  and we will not undertake acquisition or development of properties unless stringent criteria have been met

included in long term liabilities above is approximately million of liabilities relating to boykin kansas city  llc 
these liabilities were assumed in connection with the acquisition of the doubletree kansas city in november of at december   we recorded these liabilities and a corresponding increase in the cost basis of land and buildings and improvements 
the adjustment had no effect on net income or cash flows 
inflation operators of hotels in general can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit operators ability to raise rates to keep pace with inflation 
our general and administrative costs as well as real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance and ground rent are subject to inflation 
seasonality our hotels operations historically have been seasonal 
the five hotels located in florida experience their highest occupancy in the first quarter  while the remaining hotels maintain high occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and cash flow received from hotel operations 
competition and other economic factors our hotels are located in developed areas that contain other hotel properties

 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
interpretation no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and apply to older entities in the fourth quarter of in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretation 
we do not believe that we have any unconsolidated variable interest entities as of december  on april  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under statement in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative as discussed in statement and it clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  and is to be applied prospectively 
this statement has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statements no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
the effective date of a portion of the statement has been indefinitely postponed by the fasb 
we did not enter into new financial instruments subsequent to may which would fall within the scope of this statement 
we have identified a consolidated joint venture which has minority interest amounts totaling million at december  that appears to meet the criteria for liability recognition in accordance with paragraphs and under sfas due to the finite life of the joint venture arrangements 
accordingly  if and when the measurements and classification provision of these paragraphs are adopted  we may be required to reclassify the liquidation amounts of such minority interests to liabilities with the resulting income statement effect being classified as a cumulative effect of an accounting change and subsequent fluctuations in current liquidation amounts recorded through interest expense 
we will evaluate the impact that this statement would have if and when these paragraphs are adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
these debt instruments 
table of contents include the million secured credit facility  the million secured term loan  the million construction loan related to the white sand villas and our share of floating rate debt under our unconsolidated joint ventures of million at year end 
we have entered into both variable and fixed rate debt arrangements to allow us to optimize the balance of using variable rate debt versus fixed rate debt 
our variable rate debt allows us to maximize financial flexibility when selling properties and minimize potential prepayment penalties typical of fixed rate loans 
our million  fixed rate term note allows us to minimize our interest rate risk exposure 
approximately of our outstanding debt at december  was fixed rate in nature  compared with at the end of  as a result of the july expiration of the previously existing interest rate protection which historically fixed million of the million term loan at 
the weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt and total debt as of december  was and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate of our variable rate debt and total debt as of december  was and  respectively 
we review interest rate exposure continuously in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
it is our policy to manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates on our borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments  to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements  and after considering the need for financial flexibility related to our debt arrangements 
we may enter into forward interest rate agreements  or similar agreements  to hedge our variable rate debt instruments where we believe the risk of adverse changes in market rates is significant 
under a forward interest rate agreement  if the referenced interest rate increases  we would be entitled to a receipt in settlement of the agreement that economically would offset the higher financing cost of the debt issued 
if the referenced interest rate decreases  we would make payments in settlement of the agreement  creating an expense that economically would offset the reduced financing cost of the debt issued 
as of december   we do not have any material market sensitive financial instruments 
we do not believe that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on the performance or fair value of our hotel portfolio as the value of our hotel portfolio is based primarily on the operating cash flow of the hotels  before interest expense charges 
however  a change of in the index rate to which our variable rate debt is tied would change our annual interest incurred by million  based upon the balances outstanding on our variable rate instruments at december  using sensitivity analysis to measure the potential change in fair value of financial instruments based on changes in interest rates  we have determined that a hypothetical increase of in the interest rates for instruments with similar maturities would decrease the fair market value of our fixed rate debt by million as compared with the fair market value at december   which approximated the carrying value
