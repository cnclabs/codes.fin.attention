data junction virtually created the category known as etl extract  transform and load in with data junction v  one of the world s first hub and spoke approaches to data conversion and translation  and today is charting new ground in the development of business and application integration technologies 
in july  we formed a new business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive 
sql and pervasive 
sql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive 
sql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
the new business venture has resulted in improved profitability on sales in japan as the arrangement allowed us to significantly reduce our costs in japan 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
pervasive s revenues from japan were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in june  we renewed portions of our distribution agreement with ag tech for an additional three year period ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs  and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized 
table of contents 
index to financial statements ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired

index to financial statements revenues we generated revenues from continuing operations of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to the increase in revenue from continuing operations in fiscal year can be attributed to upgrades to our latest release of pervasive 
sql  v  released in december  and improved sales and marketing execution following management changes made at the beginning of fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal is primarily attributable to license and service revenues from data junction related products and services during the stub period 
our product license revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to the increase in product license revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of license revenue from data junction related products during the stub period 
licenses of our software operating on windows nt or other microsoft operating systems continue to represent approximately to of our database product license revenues 
we expect that the percentages of our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on particular platforms will continue to change from time to time 
we cannot be certain that our revenues attributable to licenses of our software operating on windows nt  or any other operating system platform  will grow in the future 
our service and other revenues were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  which represents an increase of from fiscal to  and an increase of from fiscal to the increase in service and other revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of service and other revenue from data junction services during the stub period 
international revenues  consisting of all revenues from continuing operations from customers located outside of north america  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues  respectively 
we attribute the increase in international revenue in fiscal year to improved sales and marketing execution following management changes made at the beginning of fiscal year we attribute the increase in international revenue in fiscal year primarily to increased revenue in japan and to the inclusion of revenue from data junction related products and services during the stub period 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in decreased from prior year due to inclusion of data junction revenues during the stub period  as data junction revenues are more predominantly from north america 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the future 
in general  our database business is a relatively mature business and our database product  pervasive 
sql  is experiencing increasing pressure to generate revenue due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the length of time since our last major version release of our database product december  increasing competition and what we believe to be the increasingly negative impact of general economic conditions on our isv customers who build applications utilizing our database software and reduced demand for the isvs software applications themselves 
however  revenue from recently introduced add on products for our database products  namely auditmaster and data exchange did generate database related revenue in fiscal year as we continue to market these add on products to our large base of database customers 
in addition  we believe the integration products we acquired in fiscal year represent a compelling growth opportunity as we invest in revenue synergies and opportunities presented by the acquired business  combined with our historical database business and channels 
a significant reduction in our database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents 
index to financial statements costs and expenses cost of product license revenues 
cost of product license revenues consists primarily of the cost to manufacture and fulfill orders for our shrink wrap software products  payment of license fees for third party technologies embedded in our products and amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product license revenues for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing of total revenues from continuing operations for all three fiscal years 
cost of product license revenue increased in dollar amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal and principally as the result of amortization related to the million value assigned to developed technology acquired through the data junction acquisition 
the data junction acquisition occurred in the second quarter of fiscal  and accordingly  we began to recognize amortization expense in the stub period 
we anticipate that cost of product license revenue will increase in fiscal year primarily due to a full year of amortization of purchased technology 
cost of service and other revenues 
cost of service and other revenues consists primarily of the cost to provide technical support  primarily telephone support  which is typically provided within days of purchase and the costs to deliver professional services and training services to others 
cost of service and other revenues for continuing operations was million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
cost of service and other revenue decreased in dollar amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in costs associated with consulting personnel 
cost of service and other revenues increased in dollar amount in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in technical support and consulting personnel and related operating costs associated with the data junction operations subsequent to the december  acquisition date 
we anticipate that cost of service and other revenues will increase in fiscal year primarily due to a full year of combined service and consulting activities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  foreign sales office expenses  travel and entertainment  marketing programs and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to increased costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing programs and promotional expenses related to the launch of the latest release of pervasive 
sql  v  during the second quarter of fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal is due primarily to stub period operating costs associated with the data junction operations subsequent to the acquisition date 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal primarily due to a full year of combined sales and marketing activities as we continue to increase relative investments in sales and marketing personnel and marketing programs related to the data integration product line acquired in the data junction acquisition 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs 
research and development expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  representing  and of total revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
research and development costs increased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to increased costs associated with research and development personnel and outsourced development contracts 
research and development expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily as a result of costs relating to data junction operations during the stub period 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in fiscal year will increase from costs incurred during fiscal year  due to a full year of combined research and development activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel salaries and other costs of our finance  human resources and administrative departments 
general and administrative expenses related to continuing operations were million  million and million in fiscal  
table of contents 
index to financial statements and  representing  and of total revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
general and administrative expenses decreased in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal primarily due to reductions in general and administrative personnel  bad debt expense and fees paid to professional service providers 
general and administrative expenses increased in dollar amount in fiscal year primarily as a result of costs relating to data junction operations during the stub period 
we believe our general and administrative expenses will decrease in dollar amount in fiscal year as we leverage the combined operations with data junction and given the non recurring effect of the charge described in the following paragraph 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we wrote off related party notes receivable totaling approximately million  included in general and administrative expenses 
these notes receivable  dated july and march  were written off in accordance with the original terms of the note agreements with our former chairman of the board and chief executive officer ron harris 
the terms of the original notes required the forgiveness of the balance of the notes in the event mr 
harris service to the company ended under certain conditions 
with the expiration and non renewal of mr 
harris term as a director of the company at the annual shareholders meeting on december   and with the absence of any other agreement calling for the continued service of mr 
harris to the company  the conditions for forgiveness of the notes were met 
write off of acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the data junction acquisition in december  we recorded a charge of million  or approximately of the total purchase price  for iprd 
the value allocated to the projects identified as iprd was charged to operations during the three months ended december  at the acquisition date  data junction s in process project was release of the data junction integration software product 
at the date of the acquisition  iprd was approximately complete  based upon costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the project 
release will include significant new code that will result in the creation of an improved architecture designed to solve the high performance integration needs of larger companies and will be much better suited to tackle more complex data and application integration projects 
as of the data junction acquisition date  this technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of an in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
the value of iprd was determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
given the riskier nature of the cash flows related to the iprd  a higher discount was warranted  and is based on the cost of equity plus basis points 
the resulting cash flows attributable to the iprd were discounted at a discount rate of 
the resulting net cash flows to which this discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology 
it is anticipated that  barring unforeseen circumstances  substantially all of the features of release of the data junction integration software project are expected to be completed in fiscal year some of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimated costs to complete the project and the attainment of completion  include  but are not limited to  the difficulty of predicting the duration of product development and the risks that changes in the product requirements will result in unexpected redesign activity 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes related to continuing operations was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes on our foreign operations 
income from us operations has been offset by net operating losses carried forward from previous years 

table of contents 
index to financial statements based on a number of factors  we believe that it is more likely than not  that a substantial amount of our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset due to uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets based on the lack of significant earnings history and risks associated with business combinations 
we expect to continue to incur foreign taxes associated with our international operations while our domestic income taxes will remain minimal as we utilize substantial net operating losses and various tax credits carried forward from previous years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our provision for income taxes 
effect of adoption of new accounting principle 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective july  statement discontinues the amortization of goodwill and requires future periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
in addition  statement requires reassessment of the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets 
with the adoption of statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of july  the adoption will result in a decrease in operating expense related to goodwill amortization of approximately  per year 
additionally  we completed a goodwill impairment test as allowed by statement during the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately  which is recorded as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
gain from discontinued operations 
gain from discontinued operations in fiscal was million and is the result of a reduction in the future liabilities of the discontinued operations following the partial termination of an office lease on favorable economic terms

such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
we establish our expenditure levels based on expectations as to future revenue  and  if revenue levels are below expectations  expenses can be disproportionately high 
as a result  a drop in near term demand for our products could significantly affect both revenues and profits in any quarter 
in the future  our operating results may fluctuate for this reason or as a result of a number of other factors  including increased expenses  timing of product releases  increased competition  variations in the mix of sales  announcements of new products by us or our competitors and capital spending patterns of our customers 
as a result of these factors  there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly basis 
see risk factors that may affect future results 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by continuing operations was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively

this property consisted primarily of computer hardware and software for general upgrade requirements in fiscal  and as well as an upgrade to the front office system in we expect that our capital expenditures may increase in the next fiscal year as compared to fiscal as a result of specific capital projects anticipated to upgrade certain front and back office systems 
we have a stock repurchase plan in place whereby we may repurchase shares of our common stock up to a total of million through july  as of june   we had repurchased approximately  shares of pervasive common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in july  we announced the authorization of a new million stock repurchase plan which became effective upon expiration of the previous plan on july  depending on market conditions and other factors  such purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice 
we are in the process of negotiating with our present landlord  as well as with other prospective landlords  regarding future office facilities for our austin office headquarters 
our present lease agreement allows for an early cancellation of the lease effective november   in exchange for a cancellation fee of m  paid in two installments in november and november  assuming we provide notice to our landlord by november   of our intent to cancel 
we have previously accrued for the entire cost of the cancellation fee in our balance sheet and therefore  such a cancellation payment would not be detrimental to our income statement 
various scenarios are being discussed with various parties  and at least one scenario includes the possibility of canceling the original lease and paying the cancellation fee prior to the dates referred to above  potentially as early as the quarter ending september  on june   we had million in working capital including million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
summary disclosures about contractual obligations the following table summarizes our operating lease obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods thereafter item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in japan  belgium  germany  france  england  italy  poland and india and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately  if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million

if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june   and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
