item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information about the corporation  see selected statistical information on pages of this report on form k 
overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the corporation and its predecessors since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker and thomas counties  both contiguous with colquitt county 
we recently completed the acquisition of sylvester banking company  adding worth county into our market territory 
worth county is also contiguous to colquitt county to the north 
including the recent acquisition  we have four full service banking facilities and five automated teller machines 
our strategy is to diversify our business base in order to broaden our revenue sources  to strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees in order to provide the best possible service to our customers  to maintain our strong market share  and to grow outside of our current geographic market through acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to the fluctuations in interest rates 
during  the us economy was marked by steady low interest rates 
our profitability  as in any business  is impacted as well by operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local economic factors 
some specific factors include changes in population  demographics of the population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which is outside of our control 
as a result of our strategy to diversify revenue  noninterest income has grown over the last few years 
particularly  the corporation has fully integrated its insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  into its operations 
we made significant improvements with respect to overall asset quality in specifically  during the second quarter of  the corporation made the decision to transfer the colquitt retirement inn  the corporation s largest nonperforming asset  for a nominal fee of  to the georgia trust for historic preservation 
as a result of the transfer  we reduced operating costs approximately  per year which will be realized in full in on february   the corporation completed its acquisition of first bank holding company and merged its operating subsidiary  sylvester banking company  into southwest georgia bank 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates can have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that require material estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million  a decrease of approximately million  or percent  when compared with million in the primary factors contributing to the decline included the million pre tax charge for the transfer of the colquitt retirement inn and a decrease of percent  or million  in interest income 
partially offsetting the decline was a gain of thousand in mortgage banking services income  a percent increase over the previous year  and a reduction from of million  or percent  in interest expense 
on a per share basis  net income for was per diluted share compared with per share for the weighted average common shares outstanding for the year ended december   were million  down percent or  average shares from the previous year 
the decrease in the average shares outstanding is primarily attributed to the corporation s stock repurchase program 
because of our strong capital condition  we continued through the stock repurchase program that began in january in   shares were repurchased 
through the end of  a total of  shares have been repurchased since the beginning of the program 
the share repurchase program was extended again by the board of directors at their meeting in january through the end of january the corporation is authorized to purchase  shares under the plan 
net income in increased percent over results 
the thousand increase was primarily attributable to improvement in net interest income caused by an increase in net interest margin 
the net margin in was percent up from percent in also contributing to the growth in net income in was an increase in income from mortgage banking services from million in to million in partially offsetting the increases were provisions for loan losses that were thousand higher and a decline in retail brokerage fees  which decreased from thousand in to thousand in we measure our performance on selected key ratios  which are provided for the last three years in the following table return on average total assets return on average shareholders equity average shareholders equity to average total assets net interest income net interest income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared with the decrease was influenced by the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest income from earning assets decreased million  or percent  in compared with  while interest expenses decreased million or percent for the same period 
the majority of the million decrease in interest income for the year resulted from reduced yields and volume primarily on loans 
average loan volume decreased million  or percent  in compared with while the average yield decreased basis points 
the decrease of million of interest expense in compared with primarily resulted from an basis point decline in the average rate paid on time deposits 
during  while the level of average core deposits remained relatively stable  average time deposits decreased million  or percent 
the deposit mix changed slightly due to the lower rate environment causing a shift from time to savings deposits 
interest expense on deposits continues to closely follow interest rate trends 
net interest income for increased thousand  or percent  compared with the main contributing factor for this increase is a result of lower time deposit rates in  down basis points compared with the rates in interest income in declined million to million compared with the majority of this decrease resulted from reduced yields primarily on loans 
the prime lending rate in decreased basis points to percent and remained at that level until the latter part of in november  the prime lending rate declined another basis points to percent and the corporation s base lending rate dropped to percent 
comparing with  the change in loan interest rates had a greater impact on the decline in interest income than the million  or percent  decline in the volume of average loans 
net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin was percent for  a basis point decrease from percent in the net interest margin in was up basis points compared with the net interest margin of percent in we have maintained a relatively strong net interest margin compared with peers considering the very low interest rate environment during the last few years 
noninterest income noninterest income is an important contributor to net earnings 
the largest component of the corporation s noninterest income in recent years has been mortgage banking services fees 
the following table summarizes the changes in noninterest income during the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount service charges on deposit accounts   income from trust services income from retail brokerage services income from insurance services  income from mortgage banking services    gain loss on the sale or abandonment of assets  n m n m gain loss on the sale of securities n m n m other income total noninterest income    n m not meaningful service charges on deposit accounts were positively impacted by a new bounce protection plan service implemented in for customers on their checking account 
the increases in fees from deposit accounts trust and insurance services and mortgage banking services was not enough to fully offset the million pre tax charge for the transfer of our one major nonperforming asset the colquitt retirement inn to the georgia trust for historic preservation during the second quarter of mortgage banking income increased as loan origination fees on commercial mortgages increased over the prior year 
the mortgage banking servicing portfolio is comprised of all non recourse loans which we service for participating commercial mortgage lenders 
the majority of the increase in noninterest income in was due to income from mortgage banking services 
we acquired percent of empire at the end of and the corporation changed its method of accounting for empire 
in  empire s operations were consolidated with the bank s operations 
consolidating empire s operation with the bank reflected a significant increase in income from mortgage banking services 
excluding income from mortgage banking services  noninterest income decreased thousand for compared with this decrease related primarily to the loss on the disposition of assets and lower income from retail brokerage services 
noninterest expense noninterest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
the following table summarizes the changes in the noninterest expenses for the past three years dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount salaries and employee benefits    occupancy expense equipment expense data processing expense amortization of intangible assets other operating expense    total noninterest expense    total noninterest expense decreased thousand or 
percent in compared with primarily as a result of the corporation s implementation of improved processes and technology 
salaries and employee benefits expense declined percent due to a decline in full time equivalent employees of percent to a total of at december  compared with the prior year end 
in addition  both executive and staff employee bonus awards were less in than the improvement in salaries and employee benefits was somewhat offset by an increase of thousand in other operating expenses from higher consulting services fees and pension and esop administrative expenses 
these also included higher legal fees related to the acquisition of sylvester banking company 
for  the majority of the increase in noninterest expense compared with the prior year was attributable to normal salary and performance compensation increases due to the corporation s normal merit salary increases 
the decrease in other operating expenses was from lower expenses related to other real estate property held for sale and employee training and education 
the largest increase was in legal fees which relates to legal fees in being lower than normal due to a reimbursement of fees previously expensed 
the efficiency ratio noninterest expenses divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  was percent for and percent and percent for and respectively 
federal income tax expense the corporation expensed million  million and million for federal income taxes for the years ending december   and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in an effective tax rate of for  for and for see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of tax expense 
uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets of million increased million  or percent  compared with the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits at the federal home loan bank  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a percent increase over million in the earning asset mix remained relatively stable during the year 
for  average earning assets were comprised of percent loans  percent investment securities  and percent federal funds sold and funds at the federal home loan bank 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets increased to percent for compared with percent for this increase was primarily related to the decreased level of intangible assets and foreclosed assets 
loans loans are the one of the corporation s largest earning assets and users of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio 
during  average net loans represented percent of average earning assets and percent of average total assets 
the composition of the corporation s loan portfolio at december   and was as follows dollars in thousands amount change amount change amount real estate commercial mortgage    real estate residential    real estate agricultural    commercial  financial  and agricultural loans    consumer loans    total loans    average total loans decreased in due to a decline in loan demand in our primary markets 
despite the decrease in demand  we continued to apply stringent credit criteria on all loan applications 
as a result of the decrease in average loans  the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end declined to percent in compared with percent in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of percent loans secured by commercial real estate  percent of loans secured by residential real estate  and percent of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included percent of loans for other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes and percent of loans to individuals for consumer expenditures 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible  are charged against this allowance and subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
we have not changed the lending practices and philosophy which has provided us with an exceptionally low charge off record over the past several years 
there can be no assurance  however  that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have an extensive loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other impaired loans that have been identified as potential problems 
the allowance for possible loan losses was million  or percent of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a thousand increase from the corresponding year end amount  which was percent of total loans outstanding 
the provision for loan losses was thousand in  a thousand decrease from the prior year s provision 
this provision reflected our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb possible losses in the loan portfolio 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowances for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist primarily of us government agency securities 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in debt securities are used as a source of income  to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability 
it is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements and is a means of improving profitability 
our investment policy provides adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with staggered maturities ranging from one to five years 
the following table summarizes the contractual maturity of investment securities on an amortized cost basis as of december  dollars in thousands securities securities amounts maturing in available for sale held to maturity one year or less  after one through five years   after five through ten years   after ten years   equity mortgage backed securities  total investment securities   the total investment portfolio increased to million from million at year end compared with  an increase of million  or percent 
this increase was due to a decrease in loan demand 
the average total investment portfolio increased to million in compared with million for the growth in securities available for sale was primarily attributed to a million investment in us government agency securities 
we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as being all nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due  and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets decreased million at year end compared with year end this decrease primarily resulted from less property in real estate being acquired through foreclosure during the year 
the majority of the nonperforming asset balance for and was from one large property  the colquitt retirement inn  that was acquired by foreclosure in and disposed of in nonperforming assets were approximately million  or percent of total loans and other real estate as of december   compared with million  or percent of total loans and other real estate at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is from deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits decreased percent compared with this decline in deposits was primarily due to public deposits held for special projects that were withdrawn in the average total deposits of million decreased from the level of million 
the majority of the decrease in average deposits occurred in average time deposits 
lower interest rates during resulted in a slight change in the deposit mix 
some customers shifted money from certificates of deposit to savings accounts due to lower rates paid on time certificates of deposit 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit with a value of thousand or more each 
this was a percent decrease from the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation repaid short term advances with the federal home loan bank of million leaving million to be paid in february and million to be paid in april also  in the corporation borrowed an additional million in long term advances from the federal home loan bank 
one of these two long term advances was a million fixed rate advance which will mature august the other million advance has a fixed rate for years with a maturity of march with the issuer having an option to convert the advance to a variable rate after the five year period 
liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from interest and fee income  as well as from loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits and borrowings or the rollover of maturing deposits and borrowings 
the consolidated statement of cash flow details the corporation s cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  both the operating and financing activities generated cash flow of million  while investing activities used million of this and reduced the cash and due from banks balances by thousand 
cash produced from operations continues to provide cash primarily for the payment of dividends and common stock repurchases 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and time deposits of thousand or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits remained stable representing percent of total deposits on december   compared with percent in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity such as cash which is received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments which can be easily converted to cash without significant loss 
the corporation s investment securities maturing within one year or less were million on december   which represented percent of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation had million of investment securities callable at the option of the issuer and that are reasonably likely to be called during these maturing and callable investment securities are sources for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
we are not aware of any known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations were long term debt 
the remaining contractual obligations were comprised of telephone operating leases and purchase obligations for data processing services with our primary service bureau 
we have no capital lease obligations 
payments due by period contractual less obligations than after dollars in thousands total year years years years long term debt    operating leases total contractual obligations    off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers and to reduce risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual or notional amounts do not represent future cash requirements 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk dollars in thousands commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit and financial guarantees the corporation does not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheets financing arrangements 
capital resources and dividends we continue to maintain a healthy level of capital adequacy as measured by our average equity to average assets ratio of percent in and percent in the federal reserve board has issued guidelines regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an percent ratio  of which percent must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a percent leverage ratio in tandem with the risk based ratios 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of percent  a tier i risk based capital ratio of percent  and a leverage ratio of percent

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s primary market risk lies within our exposure to interest rate movement 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by management 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that staggers maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity 
the table below provides information about the corporation s financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for each rate sensitive asset and liability listed  the table presents principal balances and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity or the earliest possible repricing opportunity dates 
we use a number of tools to measure interest rate risk 
one of the indicators for our interest rate sensitivity position is the measurement of the difference between its rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which is referred to as the gap 
a gap analysis displays the earliest possible repricing opportunity for each asset and liability category based upon contractual maturities and repricing 
at year end  our sensitivity ratio  or one year cumulative rate sensitive assets relative to cumulative rate sensitive liabilities  was percent compared with percent for this change in the sensitivity ratio was a result of the corporation s management of its exposure to interest rate risk 
we are slightly less liability sensitive at the one year gap position because we borrowed some longer term funds to take advantage of lower rates and to reduce our interest rate risk from increasing short term rates 
all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity  therefore  the sensitivity ratio is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
we monitor our asset and liability mix to ensure that the effects of interest rate movements in either direction are not significant over time
