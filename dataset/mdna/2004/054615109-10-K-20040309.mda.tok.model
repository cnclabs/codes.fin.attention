item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following tables set forth selected financial data on a consolidated basis in thousands years ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses restructuring and special charges operating income loss interest expense interest income other income income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss percentage of sales by segment years ended december  aerospace and defense group commercial products group distributed products group executive summary significant events axsys recorded bookings in excess of million ending the year with record backlog of million  of which is shippable beyond months 
as we look forward  we expect continued growth in the aerospace and defense group  which is supported by the segment s backlog of million at the end of we will continue to focus on the national missile defense market  homeland security initiatives  unmanned vehicle applications and new weapons platforms within the group 
in our commercial products group  we anticipate a recovery in the semiconductor market and expect to expand our market position within the health imaging market 
we also believe that our fast steering mirror technology will be disruptive to existing galvanometer technology in markets that utilize lasers for material processing 
during  we announced that we are part of the team that has been selected by northrop grumman corporation to produce the mirrors to be included in nasa s james webb space telescope 
as a member of the team  axsys will produce the beryllium mirror substrates and support structures for an engineering development unit  optical mirror segments and two spare units and support structures that comprise the meter primary mirror as well as the secondary mirror 
our customer will complete the assembly of the mirrors and support structures 
we expect our selection to result in a multi year  multi million dollar order with production delivery beginning in and continuing for three years 
we expect final contract negotiations to be completed in early also during  we announced our agreement to sell high performance airbearing scanners to eastman kodak company s health imaging group 
the scanners are used in laser optics assemblies of imaging systems that print medical images from magnetic resonance imaging  computed tomography  computed radiography  digital radiography and other medical modalities onto radiographic film 
kodak s exacting specifications required us to develop the most advanced scanner we have designed to date in terms of positional accuracy 
incorporating newly developed airbearings and electronics  the scanner is about ten times more accurate than those produced for the graphic arts market 
significant events during  axsys decided to exit the automation market and focus on our other businesses 
as part of this decision  we sold three of our business units  our wholly owned subsidiary teletrac  inc teletrac  our wholly owned subsidiary automation engineering  inc aei and our fiber automation division fad 
on april   we sold all of the stock of our teletrac to storage test solutions sts of aurora  colorado 
teletrac  which was based in santa barbara  california  designed and manufactured high performance spin stands that are used in the test and certification of data storage recording heads found in magnetic disk drives 
axsys sold the stock of teletrac in exchange for an interest bearing  note  which provides for payments equal to ten percent of the revenues generated from the sales of spin stands by sts with the balance  if any  due in five years 
because of the uncertain market conditions for data storage products and the terms of the note  axsys has reserved the entire value of this note and will record any principal and interest payments as ordinary income during the period received 
as a result of this sale  an asset impairment and cost of sale charge of million has been included in axsys consolidated statement of operations 
under applicable accounting principles  teletrac has not been treated as a discontinued operation and results of operations in and through the date of sale in are recorded in continuing operations 
revenues applicable to the data storage business were  in and million in as a result of the sale  we closed our santa barbara manufacturing facility and relocated our micro positioning stage  laser interferometer and autofocus product lines to our imaging systems division located in rochester hills  michigan during the second quarter of the total pre tax cost of million associated with the relocation and facility closure included a charge of  for thirty terminated employees and a charge of  for the disposal of excess furniture and fixtures 
a charge of  was incurred as a result of the write off of certain inventory related to the termination of certain minor product lines 
other costs of  associated with the relocation included costs for the equipment relocation  employee training and recruitment and facility upgrades in michigan  which were expensed as incurred 
on october   we sold all of the stock of aei to an investor group 
aei designed and manufactured flexible automation systems for the photonics market 
aei has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation were million in and million in on november   we sold the net assets of fad to palomar technologies  inc fad designed and manufactured nano positioning stages and fiber alignment test tools 
fad has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation were million in and million in the following table presents the financial results for the sold businesses and the presentation in our consolidated statement of financial results in thousands teletrac  inc data storage business automation engineering  inc fiber automation division continuing operations sales operating loss discontinued operations loss on sale operating loss significant events during the second quarter of  we adopted a major cost reduction program the cost reduction plan  which resulted in a pretax charge to earnings of approximately million  or million after tax 
in  an additional charge of  was accrued for rent expense at the manchester facility 
all cash costs have been spent through december  axsys closed a small manufacturing facility in manchester  connecticut and consolidated the activities into the imaging systems unit in rochester hills  michigan 
we also closed a small  satellite facility in newbury park  california  and consolidated it into our former facility in santa barbara  california 
pre tax charges associated with these shutdowns were  for facility exit costs 
we reduced our workforce at five locations by people or of the total workforce 
we accrued million for all severance and outplacement costs and  to cover any legal expenses related to the cost reduction program 
we also reviewed our inventory and other assets 
we recorded a charge of million to cover expected losses on two long term defense contracts 
the earnings charge also includes an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventories of approximately million 
the obsolete and excess inventory was disposed of during and other costs associated with the cost reduction plan include the write off of  in tooling and  in software costs 
the cost reduction plan reduced expenses by approximately million in the second half of  with cost reductions reaching an annualized rate of approximately million 
these cost savings were realized in reduced cost of sales and operating expenses as result of the closure of two facilities and the additional reduction in workforce 
during  axsys recorded the following amounts in the consolidated statement of operations and through december  incurred the following cash and non cash costs in connection with the cost reduction plan in thousands cost of sales selling  general administrative expense restructuring charge total inventory write downs loss contract reserves work force reductions fixed asset write downs facilities other total cash non cash the following table shows the balance sheet activity for the restructuring accrual account  which includes the costs associated with the accrued restructuring charge and the fixed asset write downs  as of december  in thousands restructuring accrual charges activity balance at december  activity balance at december  activity balance at december  results of segment operations the following tables and discussion set forth selected financial information from continuing operations on a segment basis for the years ended december    and the segment tables  shown below  exclude one time charges  which are shown separately 
aerospace and defense segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin sales in the aerospace and defense segment increased for the year ended december  compared to in addition  sales in this segment increased for the year ended december  compared to the increases in revenue are primarily due to increased sales of our beryllium machined and optical products including increased sales for products utilized in the united states missile defense program and nuclear weapons 
gross margin as a percent of sales for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year due to increased volume and favorable sales mix due to shipments of higher margin optical products and higher margin engineering prototypes 
operational improvements  including improved quality  material procurement and facility management contributed to improved margins in compared to commercial products group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin sales in the commercial products group segment for the year ended december  were comparable to sales in while we continue to experience a general downturn in the market for airbearing scanners sold into the graphic arts market  sales of our health imaging scanners resulted in additional revenues of million 
the decline in sales from to was a result of the general downturn in the graphic arts scanner market  which began in the second quarter of in addition  we sold our data storage business in santa barbara  california  which reported  of sales in and million of sales in the revenue from the data storage sales is included in the above table 
gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased during as compared to and the margin improvements are generally due to product mix and operational improvements  including the closure of the santa barbara facility during the second quarter of and the closure of a manufacturing support facility in connecticut during the second quarter of these closures resulted in annual cost savings of million 
distributed products group segment table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales cost of sales gross margin sales in the distributed products segment increased for the year ended december  as compared to largely as a result of new orders from consumer product manufacturers 
sales in fiscal year declined by compared to fiscal year primarily due to the overall weakness in the us economy 
gross margin as a percent of sales increased in compared to  while margins were lower than margins in during and  we recorded excess inventory reserves  which accounted for of sales in and in as compared to in the increase in excess inventory reserves is primarily the result of depressed market conditions  which began in early adjusting for the inventory reserve  gross margin percentages have remained relatively stable  as we have reacted to the depressed market conditions by lowering overhead and reducing spending 
one time charges included in cost of sales non allocated table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  one time charges during  we recorded a one time charge of  for the elimination of some small product lines resulting from the closure of the california facility 
during the second quarter of  in conjunction with the cost reduction plan  we recorded a one time charge of million  which primarily included a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory disposals and million charge for loss contract reserves for two long term government contracts 
operating expenses table in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and engineering expenses restructuring and special charges selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million in compared to million in  a net decrease of  during the second quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of  associated with the closure of the santa barbara  california facility and subsequent relocation of the product lines to our michigan facility 
compared to spending levels  sg a expenses were lower in the santa barbara  california facility closure resulted in savings during of million 
during  axsys implemented a restructuring plan  which closed two facilities and reduced administrative headcount by employees 
the savings impact to sg a in was million 
research  development and engineering expenses 
research  development and engineering expenses in increased  compared to as part of the cost reduction plan  we closed an engineering facility in manchester  connecticut 
this closure resulted in a termination of eight engineers with annual compensation and benefits of approximately  restructuring and special charges 
there were no restructuring and special charges in compared to million in and million in during  restructuring charges included  for termination expenses incurred in connection with the termination of our chief operating officer as a result of a segment realignment and the subsequent disposal of the automation group  million associated with asset write downs and severance expenses resulting from the sale of teletrac and  of costs relating to the relocation of some commercial oem product lines from santa barbara  california to rochester hills  michigan 
during  in conjunction with the cost reduction plan  axsys recorded restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring charges were recorded for severance pay and benefits for terminated employees and exit costs relating to the closing of two facilities 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense was  in the year ended december   compared to  in and  in interest expense is primarily for interest payments on capital leases 
the decrease in expense in compared to is primarily a result of lower capital lease balances 
interest income 
interest income was  in the year ended december  compared to  in and  in the decline in interest income since is a result of lower prevailing interest rates and lower average investment balances 
interest income of  in   in and  in from a note receivable from the sale of sensor systems has declined as the principal balance has been reduced 
in  interest income of  was received from a note receivable from storage test solutions 
other income and expense  net 
net other income in was  compared to net other income of  in and  in we received income of  in   in and  in  which was recovered from a fully reserved note from the sale of sensor systems 
this note was paid in full during the fourth quarter of during  we recorded a charge of  for the disposal of fixed assets 
taxes 
the consolidated effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to in and in the effective tax rate in and was primarily for state taxes 
no federal tax expense was incurred as a result of the tax valuation allowance recorded in during  we established a valuation allowance  which was partially offset by an anticipated capital loss carry back benefit relating to the sale of teletrac  inc the effective tax rate for discontinued operations in is 
the tax provision for continuing operations for was million  primarily as a result of two events 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 in  we established a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
the tax expense recorded as a result of the valuation allowance was partially offset by a tax benefit resulting in a permanent book and tax basis difference on the sale of teletrac  inc as we record income in the future  we will reduce the valuation allowance and accordingly  we utilized million of the reserve in at december   we continued to recognize a portion of our deferred tax asset as we have a prudent and feasible tax planning strategy  which we would implement before allowing any of our deferred tax benefits to expire 
discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we decided to divest our automation group 
we completed the disposal of the group in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded a special charge of million  net of taxes  which included  for the impairment of assets and  of closing related expenses 
the loss  net of tax  from these operations included in discontinued operations was million in compared to million in the remainder of the loss from discontinued operations in included a  charge for an environmental related expense for a previously divested operation  which was partially offset by  of income from the reversal of unutilized reserves primarily associated with the sale of the beau interconnect division in net income loss 
we had net income of million in  a net loss of million in and net loss of million in during  we sold our automation group  which resulted in a net loss of million including both operating losses and a loss on the sale 
in addition  we recorded a tax provision of million from continuing operations  which was primarily the result of the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded a restructuring and special charge associated with our cost reduction plan of million  net of taxes 
in addition  our automation group incurred a net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources axsys funds our operations primarily from cash on hand  short term investments  cash flow from operations and  to a limited extent  capital lease financing 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million and short term investments totaled million 
over the past several years  we have maintained a high level of liquidity as evidenced by our current ratio which was  and as of december   and  respectively 
this strategy was necessary as we restructured axsys and discontinued unprofitable businesses 
with this process complete  management may elect to reduce axsys liquidity to a safe  but more competitive  level by investing in more profitable long term investments and growth opportunities 
net cash provided by or used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  our primary sources of operating cash were million of net income  million of depreciation and a million federal income tax refund 
the income tax refund was partially offset by a new  income tax receivable that was recorded in one of our primary uses of cash was inventory  which grew million in the inventory growth was related to certain large programs in our aerospace and defense group 
the cash outflows for inventory were almost entirely offset by a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred income 
the increase in deferred income was the result of our strategy to actively negotiate progress payments into certain large dollar contracts for long lead time products 
this strategy helps us to mitigate the near term negative cash impact of these contracts 
in  we reduced accrued expenses and other liabilities and long term liabilities by over million 
this was primarily due to the utilization of reserves for environmental remediation  loss contracts and restructuring 
we also used  to fund increases in accounts receivable and other current assets 
in addition  we utilized  to fund obligations related to our discontinued operations 
in  axsys net loss of million included the following non cash items a million deferred tax valuation allowance  which was partially offset by a million increase in our deferred tax asset  million of depreciation   of losses on capital asset disposals and  non cash restructuring and special charges 
we also received a million federal income tax refund 
the impact of the refund was partially offset by a new income tax receivable for million  which was booked in but not received until during  we collected million in deferred income for our beryllium based products  which were partially offset by a million increase in inventories for these products 
trade accounts payable declined by million largely due to the timing of inventory receipts in the fourth quarter 
in  accrued expenses and other liabilities decreased  primarily due to payments for the remediation of two environmental sites  state taxes  and the cost reduction plan 
during  net cash provided by discontinued operations was million  which was primarily an increase in accrued liabilities and an asset impairment charge taken as a result of the sale of the automation group 
during  discontinued operations  including the loss on sale  from the automation group generated net losses of million 
in  axsys net loss of million was more than offset by depreciation and amortization of million and non cash restructuring and special charges of million 
accounts receivables also declined million  reflecting lower fourth quarter sales in inventory increased by  primarily for long lead time products in our aerospace and defense group 
this increase was partially offset by a  increase in deferred income resulting from progress payments received for these products 
current income tax receivable increased by million  due to an anticipated significant tax refund  which was received in  for net operating losses generated in trade accounts payable declined by million in response to lower production volume and reduced year end capital spending compared to the prior year 
net deferred income tax assets also increased million primarily because our loss contract reserve is not deductible for tax purposes until it is utilized 
in addition  we spent million on our discontinued operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million  
million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we invested million in short term investment securities 
the funds were invested in short term investment securities in order to minimize interest rate risk and to allow for rapid redeployment when profitable long term investment or expansion opportunities are identified 
in  we also invested million in capital equipment 
in  we invested million in capital equipment  net of  of capital lease proceeds and we received  in net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 
in  we invested million in capital equipment  net of  in capital lease proceeds 
during the past three years  investments in capital were made primarily to upgrade and expand our precision machining capabilities and our test and measurement equipment in our aerospace and defense group 
over the past three years  these investments have contributed to the sales and profitability growth of the group 
in  we anticipate increasing capital expenditures to approximately to million 
while the majority will be invested in machinery and equipment  we also plan to spend approximately million dollars to add  square feet of climate controlled manufacturing space to our cullman  alabama facility 
the additional space will be needed to produce the beryllium mirror substrates and support structures for an engineering development unit  optical mirror segments and two spare units and support structures that comprise the meter primary mirror as well as the secondary mirror for the james webb space telescope jwst 
the jwst is a multi year  multi million dollar program with initial production deliveries beginning in we are in the process of finalizing the contract for the jwst order and expect to break ground on the facility addition in march we also expect the final contract to include funding for the approximately million of specialized machining equipment that will be required to produce the mirrors 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these funds were used to repay capital leases 
in  we utilized  to retire five of our capital leases with the highest interest rates before their maturity date 
the prepayment penalties on these leases had expired  which enabled us to achieve a modest interest savings 
our remaining capital leases contain prepayment penalties  which decline each year on the anniversary date of their funding 
as the penalties decline  management may decide to prepay some or all of the remaining leases 
as of december   total debt  which consisted entirely of capital leases  was million 
total debt as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity was percent at december  and percent at december  given our high level of liquidity  low leverage  positive cash flow from operations and strong relationship with our primary bank  management believes that  if necessary  we will be able to obtain significant amounts of financing on favorable terms in order to profitably expand the business 
shareholder s equity was million  or per share  at december  compared to million or per share  at december  the increase in shareholders equity was due primarily to net income of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated single purpose entities 
contracts and commitments axsys has entered into certain contractual obligations  which will result in material cash outlays over the next several years 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for capital leases  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total as of december   axsys had operating lease commitments for all of our facilities  with the exception of our cullman  alabama facility  which is owned 
in addition  our operating lease commitments included leases on some office equipment 
as of december   axsys has various purchase obligations  which include long distance phone service  atm lines and other commitments 
we did not include cellular phone service commitments  as we determined the exposure to be minimal 
included in other long term obligations includes our commitments related to environmental remediation plans  building leases associated with discontinued operations  preferred stock litigation settlement and the liquidation of a defined benefit pension plan 
axsys is involved in the various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites 
the ultimate cost of site cleanup is difficult to predict given the uncertainties regarding the extent of cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of december   axsys determined that it was probable that it would incur approximately  of remedial costs  of which  is included in current liabilities and  is in other long term liabilities 
during  axsys disposed of the automation group  which included facilities in wilmington  massachusetts and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
as part of the terms of the sale  we remain obligated under the operating leases for these facilities 
both leases expire in and we anticipated our commitment to be million  of which  is included in current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are anticipating sub leasing these facilities and believe that our current reserves levels are adequate to cover our exposure 
however  given the uncertainties regarding the real estate market in both of these regions  we cannot be certain that we will either locate sublease tenants or will be able to sublease the facilities at our contractual rates 
we feel based on currently available information  that costs associated with these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
it is possible  however  that our results of operations for a particular fiscal period could be materially affected 
as of december   axsys has two letters of credit totaling  opened in as security deposits on building leases in wilmington  massachusetts and pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
these letters of credit are renewed annually for the term of the lease 
on may   an action was filed in the court of chancery in the state of delaware against axsys and three of the directors on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased axsys preferred stock 
the plaintiff has challenged our decision to redeem all of our outstanding shares of the preferred stock 
the plaintiff claimed that the defendants breached fiduciary duties in setting the redemption price too low and unfairly seeking to advantage holders of common stock and breached contractual duties as set forth in the certificate of designation governing the preferred stock  as well as an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
in march  the court dismissed the plaintiff s claim of breach of fiduciary duties but declined to dismiss the plaintiff s claims concerning the purported breach of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
in january of  the plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting the same causes of action raised in the original complaint 
we filed an answer  in january of  denying the material substantive allegations of the amended complaint and asserting  as affirmative defenses  the failure to state a claim and the defense that plaintiff is not an adequate class representative 
as of december   we have reached an agreement with the plaintiff in principle to settle the action  although definitive documentation of the settlement has not been filed with the court 
in conjunction with this litigation  we estimate our exposure for the potential settlement to be  axsys has a pension plan for which benefits and participation have been frozen 
pension benefits under this plan are generally based upon years of service and compensation 
our funding policy has been to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in the employee retirement income security act of  plus such additional amounts as may be determined to be appropriate from time to time 
during  we began the process to liquidate the funded plan and we anticipate the plan will be fully liquidated in with an estimated additional cash cost of  backlog a substantial portion of our business is of a build to order nature requiring various engineering  manufacturing  testing and other processes to be performed prior to shipment 
as a result  a significant portion of our annual sales is in our backlog of orders at the beginning of the year 
our backlog of orders increased by percent or million  to million at december  from million at december  we believe that a substantial portion of our backlog of orders at december  will be shipped over the next twelve months 
however  approximately of our current backlog will be shipped in and beyond 
the majority of our longer term backlog consists of firm contracts with prime contractors of the united states government for our beryllium machined products 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to inventory allowances  contingencies  bad debts and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture or distribute products  which are either components or subassemblies that are sold to other manufacturers or oems 
we do not sell any finished products directly to consumers 
therefore  we are generally not responsible for any installation or customer training 
however  some of our contracts are subject to customer acceptance and generally the customer will inspect and accept the product at our facility prior to shipment 
legal title passes to the customer upon shipment 
all revenues are recorded when product is either shipped to or received by the customer 
terms are principally fob shipping point  although occasionally product is shipped fob destination 
when the product is shipped fob destination  revenues are not recorded until the customer receives the product 
deferred income primarily results from the advance billings to our customers for the cost of beryllium  known as material only billings 
these material only billings are deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue only when the associated finished product is shipped 
due to the build to order nature of our products  except for the distribution of ball bearings  we do not offer price protection and generally do not offer discounts 
to the extent discounts are offered  they are reflected at the time of the sale as a reduction in revenues 
the price is fixed upon acceptance of the purchase order 
when customer change orders occur  any pricing changes are reflected in revised purchase orders 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over ninety days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish reserves based on experience and discussion with customers 
actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customers ability to meet our financial obligations our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our industries are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine our inventory to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
long term loss contract reserves generally  our customer contracts are completed within one year of receiving the order 
however  occasionally longer lead time orders are received with sales under these long term contracts currently recorded under the percentage of completion method 
we monitor our long term contracts periodically to determine if our actual costs are comparable to our cost estimates used at the time of order acceptance 
if we determine that our actual costs are significantly exceeding our original estimates  we will record a loss contract reserve 
currently  two long term contracts are covered by a loss contract reserve  which was established in we accrued for these contracts based on the contract price and the current cost structure  including estimated cost increases 
to the extent future manufacturing costs ie  labor rates and material costs change  our loss contract reserves will be impacted 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in several environmental remediation projects 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for cleanup is determined and costs are probable and reasonably estimatable 
when costs are not probable and reasonably estimatable  no accrual is made 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas requires that certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be accounted for as equity  now be classified as liabilities 
these financial instruments include mandatorily redeemable shares  instruments that require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares 
sfas also requires additional disclosures about alternative ways of settling these types of instruments and the capital structure of entities

these factors include those discussed below as well as inaccurate assumptions 
axsys cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing 
the aerospace and defense industry  which represents the majority of our sales  is largely dependent upon government contracts 
a significant portion of our business and business development efforts are concentrated in the aerospace and defense industry 
our business depends  in significant part  upon the us government s continued demand in the area of defense for high end  high performance components and sub systems of the type that we manufacture 
approximately of our net sales in  of net sales in and in were derived directly from contracts with the us government  or its agencies or departments  or indirectly from subcontracts with us government contractors 
the majority of these government contracts are subject to termination and renegotiation 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in us government expenditures for defense 
in addition  we cannot assure you that current and future government programs will continue to use our products 
we act as a subcontractor for many different government programs 
the funding of government programs is subject to congressional appropriations 
although multi year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements  congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may continue for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
the termination of funding for a government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that program 
that could have a negative impact on our operations 
in addition  the termination of a program or failure to commit additional funds to a program already started could increase our overall costs of doing business 
generally  government contracts and subcontracts are subject to oversight audits by government representatives and contain provisions permitting termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice at the government s convenience upon the payment of compensation only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination 
we can give no assurance that one or more of our government contracts or subcontracts will not be terminated under these circumstances 
also  we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new government contracts or subcontracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of any termination of our contracts 
as our revenues are dependent on our procurement  performance and payment under our contracts  the loss of one or more critical contracts could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
our government business is also subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
these requirements  although customary in government contracts  increase our performance and compliance costs 
these costs might increase in the future  reducing our margins  which could have a negative effect on our financial condition 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to procurement integrity export control government security regulations employment practices protection of the environment accuracy of records and the recording of costs the termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have a negative impact on our operations and could have a negative effect on our reputation and ability to procure other government contracts in the future 
licenses are required from government agencies under the arms export control act of for export of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these necessary licenses in order to conduct business abroad 
certain employees are required to hold and maintain security clearances with the department of defense and or the department of energy 
these clearances are required as we may have access to classified documents 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these necessary clearances in order to conduct business with the us government 
our operating results may vary substantially due to factors that are difficult to forecast 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by axsys or our competitors  domestic and foreign  general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the industries that we serve could cause substantial variations in our operating results 
the defense  aerospace  semiconductor capital equipment  high performance graphic art  medical imaging capital equipment  industrial automation oem and mro markets  each of which represents a significant market for our products  have historically been subject to substantial economic fluctuations due to changing demands for their products and services  introduction of new products and product obsolescence 
any future fluctuations arising from these or other conditions could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products timing and shipment of significant orders mix of products sold length of sales cycles plant openings and closings the timing of acquisitions or dispositions delays in raw materials shipments  as well as other manufacturing delays and disruptions  completion of large projects the level of backlog of orders domestic and foreign general economic conditions  and demand in the markets that we serve to some extent  primarily in our bearing distribution division  our net sales and operating results for a specific quarter will depend upon generating orders to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated rescheduling or cancellations of shipments by our customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  may cause our net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for such quarter 
the rapid pace of technological change will require continuous new product development 
our success will continue to depend in substantial part upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and to apply appropriate levels of engineering  research and development resources necessary to keep pace with these developments 
in addition  our success will depend on how well we respond to changes in customer requirements and achieve market acceptance for our products and capabilities 
any failure by axsys to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon close relationships with our customers and their willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to information or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or their enhancements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the new products and services or their enhancements  if any  that we develop  will achieve market acceptance 
our markets are extremely competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer our products to meet performance specifications set by our customers  most of whom are oems who purchase component parts or sub systems for inclusion in their end products 
product pricing and quality  customer support  experience  reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors 
there are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of precision optical and positioning components and sub systems that we sell 
our competitors  especially those in the precision optical and positioning product lines  are typically focused on a smaller number of product offerings than we are  and they are often well entrenched 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors could develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features to ours 
in addition  new processes or technologies could emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by an existing or potential customer to integrate components and sub systems into their product design 
we believe that once a customer has selected particular components or sub systems from one vendor  the customer generally relies upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific product application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other component or sub system requirements 
accordingly  axsys may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to a prospective customer that chooses to utilize a competitor s components or sub systems 
further  there are numerous competitors in markets to which we distribute precision ball bearings 
our competitors  who vary in size  include other ball bearings distributors as well as ball bearing manufacturers 
the bases of competition in the industries in which we compete could shift and we may not be able to compete successfully 
our levels of international sales and purchases could pose risks to our operating results 
our international sales from continuing operations accounted for approximately of net sales in  in  and in in addition  our products are sold to domestic customers who use them in products they sell to international markets 
also  we purchase a substantial portion of our ball bearing products from two foreign suppliers and certain other products from other foreign suppliers 
our international sales and purchases are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including general economic conditions  import and export duties and restrictions  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully manage expanded operations and acquisitions 
as part of our business development strategy  we plan to pursue acquisitions in order to expand our product offerings  add to or enhance our base of technical and sales personnel or provide desirable customer relationships 
this growth could result in a significant strain on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of our future expansion  if any  in combination with the complexity of the technologies involved in our businesses  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our customers 
additionally  we cannot assure you that axsys will be able to acquire complementary businesses on a cost effective basis  integrate acquired operations into our organization effectively  retain and motivate key personnel  or retain customers of acquired firms 
we compete for attractive acquisition candidates with other companies or investors  and that competition could increase the cost of pursuing our acquisition strategy or reduce the number of attractive candidates to be acquired 
axsys reviews and considers possible acquisitions on an on going basis 
many key product components come from single source suppliers 
a significant portion of our precision machining business depends on the adequate supply of specialty metals  such as beryllium  at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
we currently procure all of our beryllium from brush wellman  the sole us supplier  and expect to continue to rely on brush wellman for beryllium for the foreseeable future 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our supplier in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationship will continue or that we will continue to obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect our gross margins 
the partial or complete loss of brush wellman as a supplier of beryllium  or production shortfalls or interruptions that otherwise impair our supply of beryllium  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is uncertain whether alternative sources of supply could be developed without a material disruption in our ability to provide beryllium products to our customers 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our other suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationships will continue or that  in the event of a termination of our relationships with those other suppliers  we would be able to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products to our customers 
in addition  we purchase a substantial amount of ball bearings that we distribute from two foreign suppliers 
any material disruption in our supply of products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel 
axsys success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key executive officers and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on our executive officers 
in addition  since our continued success is largely dependent upon our ability to design  manufacture and sell high performance components and sub systems for the high performance technology market  we are particularly dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical personnel  including engineers and skilled machinists  with the requisite educational background and industry experience 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time  and competition for personnel is intense 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be successful in retaining our existing personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our technical or skilled personnel  or the future inability to attract technical or skilled personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property rights 
the patents of competitors could impact our business 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  non disclosure agreements and other forms of intellectual property protection to safeguard our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection offered by these patents 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competitors in the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products 
although we believe that our existing products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  third parties could assert infringement claims against us and such claims could be successful 
we must comply with strict environmental regulations  both compliance and non compliance could result in material liabilities or costs 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our engineering  research and development and manufacturing activities 
failure to comply with applicable environmental requirements could result in substantial liability to axsys  suspension or cessation of our operations  restrictions on our ability to expand our operations or requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you a that changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or regulatory policy  or the discovery of unknown problems or conditions  will not in the future require substantial expenditures  or b as to the extent of our liabilities  if any  for past failures  if any  to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and permits  any of which also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have made and continue to make investments in protective equipment  process controls  manufacturing procedures and training in order to minimize the risks to our employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of hazardous materials 
the failure to properly handle these materials could lead to harmful exposure for employees or to the discharge of certain hazardous waste materials 
since axsys does not carry environmental impairment insurance  such a failure could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  environmental problems could develop in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to invest significant resources to maintain and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities 
we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in state of the art equipment in order to increase  expand  update or relocate our manufacturing capabilities and facilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established manufacturing capabilities would require that we make further investment 
we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient funds from operations to finance any required investment or that other sources of funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  any further expansion could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results and operations 
one shareholder controls a significant block of axsys stock and this concentration could affect important operating decisions 
the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of axsys owns approximately of the outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  he will have the ability to exert influence with respect to corporate actions  including the election of directors and certain sales or mergers and acquisitions 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate substantially 
the price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations 
that price volatility may be attributable  at least in part  to the limited number of shares generally available for sale in the public market 
in addition  factors  such as  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products or services and the timing of announcements of acquisitions or dispositions by axsys or our competitors  as well as conditions in our markets generally  may have a significant adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the stock market historically has experienced volatility which has particularly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies and which sometimes has been unrelated to the operating performances of such companies 
certain anti takeover provisions could cause harm to our shareholders 
our certificate of incorporation  as amended the certificate of incorporation  our by laws the by laws and the delaware general corporation law dgcl contain various provisions which could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving axsys more difficult  even if such a transaction would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of axsys 
we have authorized  shares of our preferred stock  none of which is currently outstanding  and which we could issue without further shareholder approval and upon terms and conditions  and having rights  privileges and preferences  as the board of directors may determine 
we have no current plans to issue any preferred stock 
the by laws include provisions establishing advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals and director nominations  and permitting the calling of special shareholder meetings only by the written consent of three quarters of the board of directors or the chairman of the board 
the certificate of incorporation provides that in lieu of a meeting  action may be taken by written consent of our shareholders only by unanimous consent 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of axsys  and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of holders of common stock 
in addition  we are subject to section of the dgcl  which  among other things and subject to various exceptions  restricts certain business transactions between a corporation and a shareholder owning or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock an interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of axsys without action by the shareholders and  therefore  could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in the event of a change of control of axsys  the vesting of outstanding options issued under our long term stock incentive plan may be accelerated at the discretion of the committee administering the plan or may be required to be accelerated under certain circumstances provided for in incentive agreements 
absence of dividends on common stock 
axsys does not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future
