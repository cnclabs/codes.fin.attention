as a result of this move  ongoing and historical revenue and direct costs associated with this unit will be moved from pcg to crs 
the company is currently contemplating other changes directed at improving the operational effectiveness of the company 
the company conducts a significant portion of its operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of the company s service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on its operating results 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
for the fiscal year ended june   approximately of total service revenue was denominated in british pounds and approximately of total service revenue was denominated in euros 
as a result of the weakened us dollar against the british pound and the euro in fiscal year  the company s revenues and the company s costs increased in from the comparable period 
approximately of the company s contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  the company s clients can terminate their contracts with the company upon thirty to sixty days notice or can delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including  among others merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or production problems resulting in shortages of the product 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company regards an accounting estimate underlying its financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
the company believes that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results revenue recognition service revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized as services are performed 
the company measures progress for fixed price contracts using the concept of proportional performance based upon a unit based output method 
this method requires the company to estimate total expected units  as well as  the costs and revenue per unit 
generally  the assigned financial manager or financial analyst reviews contract estimates on a monthly basis 
adjustments to contract estimates are made in the periods in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  there have not been any significant variations between contract estimates and the actual cost incurred  which were not recovered from clients 
in the event that future estimates are materially incorrect  they could materially impact the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
billed accounts receivable  unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
deferred revenue represents amounts billed or payments received for which revenue has not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
in the event the company is unable to collect portions of its outstanding billed or unbilled receivables  there may be a material impact to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
income taxes the company s global provision for corporate income taxes is calculated using the tax accounting rules established by sfas no 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax amongst the various taxing jurisdictions in which the company operates  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses between taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the provision is a combination of current year tax liability and future tax liability benefit that results from differences between book and taxable income that will reverse in future periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities for these future tax effects are established on the company s balance sheet 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized 
monthly interim tax provision calculations are prepared during the year 
differences between these interim estimates and the final results for the year could materially impact the company s effective tax rate and its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit below its fair value 
the company has assessed the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
in fiscal years and the impairment testing involves determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing the value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment identified at june  and any future impairment of goodwill could have a material impact to the company s financial position or its results of operations

in june  the company made certain reasonable assumptions based upon market conditions  which indicated that sub lease payments for these abandoned facilities were probable 
the june restructuring charge involved fourteen properties 
the company has been successful in exiting or subleasing eleven of those properties 
after significant effort in trying to sub lease the remaining properties in a time of a declining commercial real estate market  it became apparent to the company during fiscal year that the original assumptions for the remaining three properties were no longer valid under current market conditions

specifically  effective july   the company merged the conferences and publishing business of pcg with and into the meetings and events business of mms in order to eliminate duplication and improve synergies 
as a result  revenue and direct costs associated with these businesses were moved from pcg to mms 
in addition  the company combined certain crs and corporate information technology groups into one organization led by the company s corporate information systems group in order to capitalize on various synergies in those areas 
as a result  ongoing and historical expenses related to crs activities were shifted from crs direct costs to selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  these financials reflect reclassifications of certain reimbursable expenses of pcg from reimbursement revenue into service revenue  and from reimbursable out of pocket expenses into direct costs 
these reclassifications had no impact on the company s total revenue  expenses  operating income  net income  or balance sheet

investing activities primarily reflect acquisition costs and capital expenditures for information systems enhancements

cash flow from these contracts typically consists of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is generally recognized as work is performed 
as a result  cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
days sales outstanding the company s operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  was days at june  compared with days at june  the decrease in dso as of june  as compared with june  was due primarily to improved billing practices and increased collection activities  as well as a higher level of deferred revenue

lines of credit the company has a line of credit with abn amro bank  nv in the amount of euro million 
this line of credit is not collateralized  is payable on demand  and bears interest at a rate ranging between to

at june   the company had approximately euro million available under this line of credit 
the company has other foreign lines of credit with banks totaling approximately million 
these lines are used as overdraft protection and bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the lines of credit are payable on demand and are supported by parexel international corporation 
at june   the company had approximately million available under these credit arrangements 
the company has a cash pooling arrangement with abn amro bank 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the net position is used as a basis by the bank for interest calculation 
each legal entity owned by the company and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit or debit balance 
therefore  interest income is earned in legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged in legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s overall balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
interest income and interest expense are recorded separately in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
financing needs the company s primary cash needs are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  acquisition related costs  capital expenditures  and facilities related expenses 
the company s principal source of cash is from contracts with clients 
if the company is unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients and or if the level of contract cancellations increases  revenue and cash flow will be adversely affected see risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of the company s new business bookings or contract cancellations  parexel believes that its existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs over the next months and on a longer term basis 
in the future  the company expects to consider acquiring businesses to enhance its service offerings  expand its therapeutic expertise  and or increase its global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financing  and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
the company may be unable to secure such financing on terms acceptable to the company 
the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal year on september   the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to million of the company s common stock to be repurchased in the open market subject to market conditions

the company s financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the company s consolidated financial results 
the company may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when the company s foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary s functional local currency 
to the extent the company is unable to shift the effects of currency fluctuations to its clients  foreign exchange fluctuations as a result of currency exchange losses could have a material effect on the company s results of operations
