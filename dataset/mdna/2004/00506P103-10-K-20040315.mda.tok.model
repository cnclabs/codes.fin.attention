part i item business 
table of contents business overview we develop  market and support strong authentication and trusted digital identity systems and products that enable our customers to issue  use and maintain digital identities in a secure  manageable and reliable manner 
our systems and products include software and hardware products that facilitate the authentication of a user to a network  a system or an application through a number of different personal security devices  such as a smart card  token  biometric device  mobile phone or personal digital assistant 
our customers have a broad range of applications and systems with specific security and digital identity requirements 
our systems support a broad range of authentication methods including passwords  public key infrastructure  remote network access login  biometrics  multi function smart cards and multi function smart cards with picture identification that can also be used for physical access control 
for example  combining certain of our company s products  such as activcard tokens and activpack authentication server software provides a customer with a single function security system for remote network access login 
alternatively  combining a smart card  a card reader  activcard java applets  activcard gold client software and the activcard identity management system creates a single platform that provides a customer with multi function capabilities that can support a broad range of security requirements  as well as personal information about the user 
by consolidating these credentials and applications onto a single personal security device  such as a smart card or mobile phone  security is increased because the user need only manage a single personal security device as opposed to multiple devices for each database 
by taking advantage of the programmable capabilities of the chip residing on the smart card  system administrators have the ability to manage the credentials stored on the smart card remotely 
further  by consolidating the credentials on a smart card  system administrators only need to manage a single device instead of many devices 
our products enhance network security by providing two factor authentication  which is combining something a user has  such as a personal security device like a smart card or a token  with something a user knows  such as a pin 
the two factors are required to access a network 
the network service provider or system administrator authenticates a user s personal security device to the network database  gaining increased assurance that the person utilizing the network service or application is who they say they are 
our products are based on an open architecture and are designed to be inter operable across a complex mix of systems and applications 
organizations deploying our products have the flexibility to offer diverse services and to select from different deployment strategies and providers of various authentications technologies  card operating systems  directory services  certificate authorities and network management systems

industry background networks currently enable people  businesses  governments and other entities to communicate  conduct commerce  access and share information  entertain  provide services and conduct countless other activities 
individuals and organizations are now using computer networks for increasingly sensitive tasks  such as attracting new customers  accessing new markets  improving customer service and satisfaction  and lowering support and distribution costs 
the use of computer networks is extending to a number of more valuable and sensitive activities  including business to business transactions  electronic data interchange edi and on line retail purchases and payments 
on line companies have enjoyed dramatic growth in their customer base and revenue as consumers execute an increasing number of transactions over the network 
as networks expand  new devices are introduced  new applications are developed and network transactions continue to proliferate 
networking technologies  including wireless technologies  will further enable communication and the sharing of information  for example  between devices and appliances without interaction from human beings 
the proliferation of network computing and the extension of corresponding network services to a user involve a relationship between a user and a network service provider or system administrator 
a network service provider can generally be defined as a provider of a service  for example on line banking  and the user  in this example  a bank s customer 
together  the user and the network service provider form a trusted community  where the network service provider extends access or capabilities for a service through a network to the user 
the network service provider needs assurance of the identity and security of the user being served 
further  the user of a network service must gain assurance that his or her privacy or personal information is not being compromised when transacting over the network 
a network service provider will only provide a service and a user will only conduct transactions over a network if the following is achieved 
table of contents access control to the network in order to manage access rights to sensitive information  confidentiality  which involves the encryption of data transmissions so that only the intended recipient can access the information  data integrity that ensures that data is not compromised or manipulated  non repudiation which provides undeniable proof that transactions  once committed  are valid  binding and irrevocable  and authentication  which proves the identity of users and systems on the network 
historically  network access control issues have been addressed by security products and solutions 
while security is a significant factor when transacting over networks  customers are increasingly looking for broader product solutions that provide multi function and multi service capabilities compared to single function solutions  seamless integration of multiple applications onto existing network infrastructure and the preservation of existing network infrastructure investment 
investment in the build out of private  public and hybrid networks has been substantial in recent years as applications for users have proliferated and network features and functionalities have been introduced 
however  the administrative complexity of a network is typically compounded by the variety of systems in place for each of its services and applications 
network administrators are faced with a multitude of challenges when overlaying applications and services on to their networks 
today  network administrators require digital identity solutions that are easy to implement  preserve existing infrastructure and investment  improve business processes  reduce operating costs  provide for increased network and user security  provide opportunity to more effectively implement new technologies  simplify access to network applications and services for users  consolidate existing network services onto a single platform  consolidate network application and services management capabilities  and achieve an acceptable return on investment 
the activcard solution we have developed a broad range of products based on open standards that provide customers with increased assurance that users are who they say when logging on to a network 
activcard s personal security devices  such as a smart card or token  bind the user to a credential that they can carry with them 
this enables organizations to adopt more efficient network based processes with increased security 
activcard digital identity software allows organizations to remotely initialize  personalize  and manage user credentials and applications before and after issuance of a personal security device 
this complete lifecycle management capability enables organizations to offer uninterrupted user services

iso is a quality assurance model used by companies that design  produce  install  inspect and test service items 
our hardware products are shipped directly to distribution partners  customers or to corporate warehouses in hong kong  singapore  fremont  california and suresnes  france for subsequent distribution 
suppliers 
our products are designed and built with high quality standard parts and components 
we generally maintain a three month supply of critical components  including microcontrollers  lcds and transistors 
the relationships with our suppliers of critical components have existed for over three years and we have not suffered any material breaks in supply during that period 
we currently purchase smart cards and smart card readers from third party original equipment manufacturers 
quality control 
we maintain strict internal and external quality control processes  which are performed during product design  production and acceptance 
we contract with a third party to ensure that our quality control specifications are adequately met at various levels from inventory audits to final product inspections 
during  we fully implemented a computer assisted production and inventory management system to increase quality as production volumes advance 
competition the network security industry is highly competitive and evolving  and we may be unable to compete successfully in the future  which may harm our business 
we compete in numerous markets  including digital identification  network access control  personal credential security  and smart card  biometric and token based network applications and authentication 
these markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology and industry standards  evolving user needs and the frequent introduction of new products 
we believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our markets include product functionality  performance  scalability  flexibility and features of products  use of open standards technology  quality of service and support  reputation and price 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote 
table of contents greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  certain of our competitors may determine  for strategic reasons  to consolidate  to substantially lower the price of their products or to bundle their products with other products  such as hardware products or other software products 
we expect that there will be additional consolidation in the digital identity market and such consolidation may materially adversely impact our competitive position 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves  with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our principal competitors include  among others  rsa security  inc  a token and network security manufacturer and cryptographic technology supplier  ssp litronic division  a supplier of data security products and services  datakey  inc  makers of proprietary smart cards and token solutions  gemplus sca  a smart card manufacturer  and vasco data security  inc  a token manufacturer and supplier 
in addition  we expect additional competition from other emerging and established companies 
we intend to leverage our financial strength by investing in the development of a broader product offering for our customers 
we will focus on providing our customers with a comprehensive card issuance  management and smart card middleware software suite with advanced functionality and features in all of our products
