item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background organization through a series of mergers and acquisitions  we have grown substantially since our inception in patriot american hospitality  inc  or patriot  was formed on april  as a self administered real estate investment trust  or reit  to acquire equity interests in hotel properties 
on october   patriot completed an initial public offering of its common stock and commenced its operations 
on july   patriot merged into california jockey club  or cal jockey 
as part of this merger  cal jockey and bay meadows operating company  or bay meadows  entered into a paired share arrangement under which both of their common stocks were paired and traded together 
also  cal jockey changed its name to patriot  and bay meadows changed its name to patriot american hospitality operating company 
in january  wyndham hotel corporation merged into patriot and  as part of that merger  patriot american hospitality operating company changed its name to wyndham international  inc we will refer to wyndham international  inc as it existed before june  as old wyndham 
patriot and old wyndham grew primarily by acquiring hotels and other related businesses 
they financed these acquisitions with funds drawn on their revolving credit facilities and capital raised by issuing paired shares and by having their two operating partnerships issue limited partnership interests 
on june   we restructured our organization 
as part of this restructuring patriot became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  we and patriot terminated the paired share arrangement  each outstanding paired share was converted into one share of our class a common stock  and patriot terminated its status as a reit effective january  and became a taxable corporation as of that date 
also on june   we completed a billion series b preferred stock equity investment  closed a new credit facility comprised of a senior credit facility and an increasing rate loan facility  which has since been amended and restated  and closed on additional mortgage debt 
holders of our series b preferred stock are entitled to a quarterly dividend on a cumulative basis at a rate of per year of which a portion is payable in additional shares of our series b preferred stock 
our series b preferred stock is convertible  at the holders option  into shares of our class b common stock 
also in  we completed a rights offering of our series a preferred stock  which  except for voting rights  has substantially similar terms to our series b preferred stock 
we used the proceeds of our series a preferred stock offering to redeem some of our series b preferred stock 
our credit facility prohibits us from paying the cash portion of the preferred dividend until expiration or further amendment of our credit facility 
under the terms of our preferred stock  if cash dividends are in arrears and unpaid for a period of days or more  an additional amount of dividends accrue at a rate per annum of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until all cash dividends in arrears have been paid in full 
such additional

as of december   we had issued an additional stock dividend of  shares of series a and series b preferred stock with a value of million because cash dividends totaling million on the preferred stock had been in arrears and unpaid for a period of more than days 
over the past several years we have sold  and we currently intend to continue to sell all of our non strategic  non convertible assets 
these are properties that do not fit our proprietary brand profile because of the quality of the asset or the fact that it is encumbered by a long term licensing agreement with a non wyndham brand 
by disposing of these assets  we will be able to focus solely on being a branded operating company  as well as reduce a portion of our debt with the net proceeds from these asset sales 
since implementing this plan in june of  we have sold assets with gross proceeds of approximately billion 
we have non strategic assets remaining to be sold 
these assets will be held until such time as the sales price meets or exceeds management s assessment of their fair value

indebtedness on march   we entered into a fourth amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility and a third amendment of our increasing rate loans facility 
the amendments and restatements include the following an increase in the letter of credit availability under our revolving facility from million to million  waivers and consents by the lenders to any resolution of issues surrounding certain under performing properties  extension of the outside date by which we must grant mortgage liens to the lenders on certain excluded properties under the credit facilities  and authorization to effect certain administrative organizational changes to our corporate structure 
on may   we entered into a fifth amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility and a fourth amendment of our increasing rate loans facility 
the amendments provided for the extension of the maturity dates of our revolving and increasing rate loan facilities held by consenting lenders previously scheduled to occur on june  to april  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the principal repayment of million of the term and increasing rate facilities before february  on december   we satisfied all conditions precedent necessary to affect an extension of the consenting lenders maturity dates for the revolving credit facility and the increasing rate loans to april  loans held by non consenting lenders totaling approximately million will retain the original maturity date of june  pursuant to the terms of the amended credit facilities  we have retained an amount sufficient to satisfy such million debt at maturity from the net cash proceeds of asset sales and refinancings 
the proceeds of asset sales and refinancings were the primary sources of funds for the million principal repayment and the million reserve for the june  maturities 
in connection with the maturity extensions  the available commitments under our revolving credit facility have been reduced by million 
over of the revolving and increasing rate lenders voted in favor of the amendments 
also  consenting lenders will receive an increase in interest rate and certain fees as set forth in the amended credit facilities  including a fee to be paid at maturity based upon the sum of the revolving commitments and outstanding terms loans  if any  as of june  pursuant to the terms of the amended credit facilities in effect following the maturity extensions described above  we may retain some or all of the net cash proceeds from asset sales and refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness other than the credit facilities up to million to be used to repay the non consenting lenders at the june original maturity date as long as we maintain a pro forma minimum revolving credit facility 
table of contents 
index to financial statements commitment availability after giving effect to such retention 
as of january   we have retained million to satisfy the non consenting lenders at the june original maturity date from the net cash proceeds of asset sales and refinancings 
we may retain all or any portion of the reserved amount in the event the outstanding balance of the loans held by non consenting lenders is less than the reserved amount as of the june maturity date 
following the retention described above  we will apply net cash proceeds in the following manner first  the initial million of asset sale proceeds each year may be retained by us  provided that the second million of the million may be retained only if our liquidity falls below a certain level set forth in the credit facilities  second  subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit facilities including our maximum liquidity levels  we may elect to retain up to of such net cash proceeds with the balance applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities  up to a maximum of million a year  third  to repay scheduled term loan payments  fourth  after we have retained million in such year  or if we are not permitted to retain a percentage of the asset sale or refinancing proceeds as a result of the limitations set forth in the credit facilities  of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis 
we also agreed to use of the net cash proceeds from new debt issuances other than refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness which will be applied in accordance with the previous sentence to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis 
on june   we completed a million mortgage refinancing secured by hotel properties 
the loan was made by affiliates of lehman brothers holdings inc  bears interest at the rate set forth in note  footnote to our consolidated financial statements and has an initial maturity date of june  we have the sole discretion to extend the maturity date of the loan to as late as july  the loan refinanced the two mortgage pools that were scheduled to mature on july  and july   respectively 
on november   we refinanced the wyndham condado plaza mortgage debt totaling million as of september   with lehman brothers holdings inc a portion of the excess proceeds received from the condado refinancing was used to pay down million of the senior credit facility and increasing rate loan 
the new loan totaling million bears interest at llbor plus  with a libor floor  and matures on november  the maturity date may be extended  solely at our own option  for three one year periods 
despite our successful efforts to amend our credit facilities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet our debt service obligations and  to the extent that we cannot  we may lose some or all of our assets  including hotel properties 
continuing adverse economic conditions could cause the terms on which we borrow to worsen 
those circumstances  if we are in need of funds to repay indebtedness  could force us to liquidate one or more investments in properties at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on those investments 
the foregoing risks associated with our debt obligations may inhibit our ability to raise capital in both the public and private markets and may have a negative impact on our credit rating 
during  we have scheduled principal payments and debt maturities of approximately million 
of that amount  we can elect to extend million for two additional twelve month periods  and an additional million of debt has been provided for in a restricted cash account 
we are seeking to refinance the remaining scheduled principal payments and debt prior to their maturities in  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so

as of december   we had approximately million in liquidity 
our liquidity is defined as revolver availability plus cash in our overnight accounts 
on march   we entered into a fourth amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility and a third amendment of our increasing rate loans facility 
the amendments and restatements include the following an increase in the letter of credit availability under our revolving facility from million to million  waivers and consents by the lenders to any resolution of issues surrounding certain under performing properties  extension of the outside date by which we must grant mortgage liens to the lenders on certain excluded properties under the credit facilities  and authorization to effect certain administrative organizational changes to our corporate structure 
on may   we entered into a fifth amendment and restatement of our term loan and revolving credit facility and a fourth amendment of our increasing rate loans facility 
the amendments provided for the extension of the maturity dates of our revolving and increasing rate loan facilities held by consenting lenders previously scheduled to occur on june  to april  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the principal repayment of million of the term and increasing rate facilities before february  on december   we satisfied all conditions precedent necessary to affect an extension of the consenting lenders maturity dates for the revolving credit facility and the increasing rate loans to april  loans held by non consenting lenders totaling approximately million will retain the original maturity date of june  pursuant to the terms of the amended credit facilities  we have retained an amount sufficient to satisfy such million debt at maturity from the net cash proceeds of asset sales and refinancings 
the proceeds of asset sales and refinancings were the primary sources of funds for the million principal repayment and the million reserve for the june  maturities 
in connection with the maturity extensions  the available commitments under our revolving credit facility have been reduced by million 
over of the revolving and increasing rate lenders voted in favor of the amendments 
also  consenting lenders will receive an increase in

as of january   we have retained million to satisfy the non consenting lenders at the june original maturity date from the net cash proceeds of asset sales and refinancings 
we may retain all or any portion of the reserved amount in the event the outstanding balance of the loans held by non consenting lenders is less than the reserved amount as of the june maturity date 
following the retention described above  we will apply net cash proceeds in the following manner first  the initial million of asset sale proceeds each year may be retained by us  provided that the second million of the million may be retained only if our liquidity falls below a certain level set forth in the credit facilities  second  subject to certain limitations set forth in the credit facilities including our maximum liquidity levels  we may elect to retain up to of such net cash proceeds with the balance applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities  up to a maximum of million a year  third  to repay scheduled term loan payments  fourth  after we have retained million in such year  or if we are not permitted to retain a percentage of the asset sale or refinancing proceeds as a result of the limitations set forth in the credit facilities  of such proceeds must be applied to repay indebtedness under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis 
we also agreed to use of the net cash proceeds from new debt issuances other than refinancings of existing mortgage indebtedness which will be applied in accordance with the previous sentence to reduce outstanding indebtedness under the credit facilities on a pro rata basis 
on june   we completed a million mortgage refinancing secured by hotel properties 
the loan was made by affiliates of lehman brothers holdings inc  bears interest at the rate set forth in note  footnote to our consolidated financial statements and has an initial maturity date of june  we have the sole discretion to extend the maturity date of the loan to as late as july  the loan refinanced the two mortgage pools that were scheduled to mature on july  and july   respectively 
on november   we refinanced the wyndham condado plaza mortgage debt totaling million as of september   with lehman brothers holdings inc a portion of the excess proceeds received from the condado refinancing was used to pay down million of the senior credit facility and increasing rate loan 
the new loan totaling million bears interest at llbor plus  with a libor floor  and matures on november  the maturity date may be extended  solely at our option  for three one year periods 
we have considered our short term liquidity needs and the adequacy of adjusted estimated cash flows and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe that our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund our normal recurring expenses and our debt service requirements 
we anticipate that these needs will be fully funded from our cash flows provided by operating activities and  when necessary  from our revolving credit facility 
in the past  we have generally met our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of activities  such as development and scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the proceeds from the sale of our assets 
in the future  we may seek to increase our capital resources through similar activities or  subject to limitations imposed by the terms of our credit agreements and preferred stock  through offerings of debt or equity securities  including convertible notes and preferred or common stock

dividends we do not anticipate paying a dividend to our common stockholders and we are prohibited under the terms of our senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying dividends on our class a common stock 
for the six year period beginning september   dividends on our series a and series b preferred stock are payable partly in cash and partly in additional shares of our series a and series b preferred stock  with the cash portion aggregating million per year  so long as there is no redemption or conversion of our series a and series b preferred stock 
for the following four years  dividends are payable in cash or additional shares of our series a or series b preferred stock  as the case may be  as determined by our board of directors 
after year ten  dividends are payable solely in cash 
we are prohibited under the terms of the january  amendments to the senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility from paying cash dividends on the series a and series b preferred stock 
as of december   we have deferred payments of the cash portion of the preferred stock dividend totaling approximately million 
this amount has been included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of december  in addition  according to the terms of our series a and series b preferred stock  if the cash dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for at least days  then an additional amount of dividends will accrue at an annual rate of of the stated amount of each share of preferred stock then outstanding from the last payment date on which cash dividends were to be paid in full until the cash dividends in

these additional dividends are cumulative and payable in additional shares of preferred stock 
as of december   we have issued an additional stock dividend of  shares of series a and series b preferred stock with a value of million 
renovations and capital improvements during  we invested approximately million in capital improvements and renovations 
these capital expenditures included i costs related to enhancing the revenue producing capabilities of our hotels and ii costs related to recurring maintenance 
during  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures primarily for recurring maintenance capital expenditures and technological initiatives 
we are limited to capital expenditures of million per year  plus million per year for emergency capital expenditures under the terms of the january  amendments to the senior credit facility and increasing rate loans facility 
we attempt to schedule renovations and improvements during traditionally lower occupancy periods in an effort to minimize disruption to the hotel s operations 
therefore  we do not believe such renovations and capital improvements will have a material effect on the results of operations of the hotels 
capital expenditures will be financed through capital expenditure reserves or with working capital 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit our ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality the hotel industry is seasonal in nature  however  the periods during which our hotel properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property and depend predominantly on the property s location 
our revenues typically have been higher in the first and second quarters than in the third or fourth quarters 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of assets  assets held for sale  bad debts  income taxes  insurance reserves  derivatives  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review the carrying value of our assets  including intangible assets  to determine if events and circumstances exist indicating that assets might be impaired 
if facts and circumstances support this possibility of impairment  our management will prepare probability weighted undiscounted and discounted cash flow projections which require judgments that are both subjective and complex 
our management uses its judgment in projecting which assets will be sold by us within the next twelve months 
these judgments are based on our management s knowledge of the current market and the status of current negotiations with third parties 
if assets are expected to be sold within months  they are reclassified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we maintain a paid loss deductible insurance plan for commercial general liability  automobile liability  and workers compensation loss exposures related to our hotel operations 
the primary loss deductible retention limit is currently  per occurrence for general liability and  per occurrence for automobile liability and workers compensation loss  in most jurisdictions 
the estimates of the ultimate liability for losses and associated expenses are based upon a third party actuarial analysis and projection of actual historical development trends of loss frequency  severity and incurred but not reported claims as well as traditional issues that affect loss cost such as medical and statutory benefit inflation 
in addition  the actuarial analysis compares our trends against general insurance industry development trends to develop an estimate of ultimate costs within the deductible retention 
large claims or incidents that could potentially involve material amounts are also monitored closely on a case by case basis 
as of december   our balance sheet included an estimated liability with respect to this self insurance program of million 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
during the year ended december   such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with a portion of our variable rate debt 
as of december   we did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges 
additionally  we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair value of our derivative instruments 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
future cash inflows or outflows from our derivative instruments depend upon future borrowing rates 
if assumptions about future borrowing rates prove to be materially incorrect  the recorded value of these agreements could also prove to be materially incorrect 
because we use the derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to increases in variable interest rates  thus effectively fixing a portion of our variable interest rates  the impact of changes in future borrowing rates could result in our interest expense being either higher or lower than might otherwise have been incurred on our variable rate borrowings had the rates not been fixed 
a reduction in interest rates could result in a competitive advantage for companies in a position to take advantage of a lower cost of capital 
we are a defendant in lawsuits that arise out of  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
our management uses its judgment  with the aid of legal counsel  to record accruals for losses that we consider to be probable and that can be reasonably estimated as a result of any pending actions against us 
newly issued accounting standards we implemented the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in as a result of the adoption of sfas  gain and losses on long lived assets classified as held for sale subsequent to january   the effective date of sfas  was classified as gains or losses from the disposal of discontinued operations 
certain gains and losses on long lived assets classified as held for sale that 
table of contents 
index to financial statements were disposed of during the years ended december   and  have been classified in continued operations because they were classified as held for sale as of december  and restatement of prior periods is not permitted under sfas on january   we adopted sfas  rescission of sfas  and  amendment of sfas and technical correction 
sfas rescinds sfas  and and amends sfas to modify the accounting for sale leaseback transactions 
sfas required the classification of gains and losses resulting from extinguishment of debt to be classified as extraordinary items 
pursuant to the adoption of sfas  we reclassified amount shown as extraordinary item for the year ended december  to continuing operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
in response to a growing number of companies announcing plans to record expenses for the fair value of stock options  sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require more prominent disclosure about the effects of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income 
finally  sfas amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
the amendments to sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we made the disclosures required by the provisions of sfas on page f under stock compensation 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of fin is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interest  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds a variable interest in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosure by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the disclosure provisions of fin became effective upon issuance 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to vie s created after january  and in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  to existing vie s 
we did not establish any variable interest entities after january  we are in the process of evaluating all of our lease  management and joint venture relationships that existed prior to january  in order to determine whether the entities are vie s and whether we are considered to be the primary beneficiary or whether we hold a significant variable interest 
we believe it is reasonably possible that our interest in one management contract wyndham anatole is a vie where we are the primary beneficiary  which requires consolidation under fin as of january  had consolidation been required as of december   we would have recorded assets of million  liabilities of million and minority interest of million 
in the unlikely event that we terminate the management contract and all of the underlying assets related to this contract had no value  we estimate that the maximum exposure to loss would approximate million  primarily representing the net carrying value of our investment in the wyndham anatole at december  however  we expect to recover the recorded amount of our investment in the wyndham anatole 
as we finalize our evaluation of the impact of applying fin  additional entities may be identified that would need to be consolidated 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas the new guidance amends sfas for decisions made a as part of the derivatives implementation group process that effectively required amendments to sfas  b in connection with other board projects dealing with financial instruments  and c regarding implementation issues raised in relation to the application of the definition of a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements derivative  particularly regarding the meaning of an underlying derivative and the characteristics of a derivative that contains financing components 
the amendments set forth in sfas improve financial reporting by requiring that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with a few exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas specifies that instruments within its scope embody obligations of the issuer and that  therefore  the issuer must classify them as liabilities 
for calendar year end companies  sfas will become effective at the beginning of their third quarters 
sfas is effective immediately for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  for all other instruments  sfas goes into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of a non public entity 
for contracts that were created or modified before may  and still exist at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   entities should record the transition to sfas by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle 
sfas prohibits entities from restating financial statements for earlier years presented 
on october   the fasb deferred the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
those provisions require that mandatorily redeemable minority interests within the scope of sfas be classified as a liability on a parent company s financial statement in certain situations  including when a finite lived entity is consolidated 
the deferral of those provisions is expected to remain in effect while these interests are addressed in either phase ii of the fasb s liabilities and equity project or phase ii of the fasb s business combinations project 
however  the fasb did not defer the disclosure provisions relating to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
therefore  in accordance with sfas  if we liquidate the consolidated subsidiaries in which there exists a minority interest  we would be required to pay approximately million in cash 
such amount is lower than the carrying amount of the minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries by million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to future changes in interest rates related to our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments  including debt obligations  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  and future debt commitments

our derivative portfolio consists entirely of interest rate protection agreements  which are valued based on the present value of future expected hedge payments over the remaining term of each interest rate hedge 
since  the hedges have moved closer to their maturity date at the end of  the present value of future expected hedge payments has decreased 
consequently  the negative market value on the hedges has decreased which resulted in a decrease to the liability for derivative instruments
