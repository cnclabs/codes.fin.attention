item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated  discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations 
executive summary our business is characterized by a very stable customer base resulting in consistent cash flow generation 
we provide a very basic  industrial type service to our customers that is essential to their needs 
competition is driven by local economic and demographic factors as well as fluctuations in capacity utilization  in both the collection and landfill business 
we believe capacity utilization tends to ultimately impact pricing for our services through the economics of supply and demand 
the order of magnitude for year over year price and volume changes over the past three years has been less than three percent to both the positive and negative 
customer service levels industry wide are very high since the collection customer has a very low tolerance for poor service 
our operating costs are largely predictable  commensurate with the stability of our customer base 
labor costs are the most significant at approximately one third of our total operating costs  consistent with our extensive workforce 
the direct cost of disposing of waste at third party sites is approximately of our total operating costs 
direct disposal costs excludes the disposal costs associated with the of our collected waste which is disposed of at our own facilities  the costs thereof are included in each of the other landfill related operating cost line items 
repairs and maintenance expense is approximately of our total operating costs and each of transportation  vehicle operating and safety and insurance range from approximately to of our total operating costs 
our selling  general and administrative costs are also largely predictable since salaries and management incentive compensation represents approximately of our selling  general and administrative costs 
we spend a large amount of capital to support the ongoing operations of our business 
in  we incurred million in capital expenditures  including million to support and sustain the landfill and transfer business and million to reinvest in the collection business 
landfills are highly engineered  sophisticated facilities similar to civil works 
each year we spend capital at our active landfills to ensure sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle 
in addition  we have approximately  collection vehicles and over  containers to serve our collection customers 
they endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely replaced 
that said  we have a certain amount of flexibility as to when and how we spend capital on these assets without materially impeding operations 
cash flows in our business are for the most part predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base  operating costs and capital spending 
as a result  our business is conducive to servicing a significant level of indebtedness 
knowing this  we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own 
we paid cash to acquire existing cash flow 
this financial model will allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we use our cash flow to repay debt 
we  of course  need to prudently manage our debt depending on the varying economic and capital market conditions to avoid unnecessary risk 
over the next four to five years  if you consider our average cash flow generation of the last three years  we may approach a point where our credit ratios would allow us to avail the company of the economic benefits of a crossover investment grade company 
as this occurs  we believe two things will happen 
first  the cost of debt and interest expense will decline 
second  we will have the opportunity to choose the best use of our excess cash flow further repay debt  pay a dividend  repurchase stock or reinvest in growing the size of our company 
if opportunities arise to accelerate the de leveraging process  we may take advantage of them as long as the opportunities have a positive effect on cash flows 
results of operations 
during  we experienced a decline in operating earnings primarily attributable to pricing pressures driven by the continued economic slowdown 
we believe that reduced volume growth industry wide  since the start of the economic downturn in  has caused pressure on our average per unit price 
competition  driven to some extent by excess capacity  has moved prices for services lower 
economic pressures have made it difficult over the past couple of years  including  to recover with pricing  the increases in costs caused by normal inflation and increases in medical  property and casualty insurance and financial assurance costs in excess of inflation 
this has caused a decrease in operating margin 
recent economic data has indicated upward trends and recovery in the economy 
historically  we believe the waste industry has lagged in seeing the improvement in operating results from an economic recovery 
during  we began to see improvement in both pricing and volume growth 
however  consistent with our industry  we have not seen significant improvements and have not fully regained the ability to recover increases in operating costs to improve operating margins 
we believe that a sustained economic recovery could drive greater volume growth  increase capacity utilization and therefore positively effect average per unit pricing 
we anticipate that costs will continue to increase from normal inflation 
in addition  we currently expect our insurance and financial assurance costs to continue to increase at a rate in excess of inflation 
over the next several years  we will continue to look internally for cost reduction opportunities to offset these cost increases 
financing activities 
we are committed to reducing debt 
in  in addition to generating strong operating cash flows  we successfully executed a plan to refinance our credit facility  raise equity and sell assets to improve liquidity reduce and extend debt maturities and increase cash flow 
as a result of good market conditions for non investment grade issuers  we were able to exceed this plan by further extending maturities and improving cash flow 
during  and  we experienced the impact of the general economic downturn in a reduction to earnings  however  we were able to generate million  million and million  respectively  an average of million  of cash flow from operations to repay debt after funding capital expenditures 
in  through the execution of financing transactions and debt repayments  we have continued to de lever the company as evidenced by the reduction in our debt to total capitalization from at the end of to at the end of liquidity has improved through the increase in capacity available under our revolving credit facility and extended debt maturities  among other actions 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow to repay debt and to seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through the reduction in interest cost 
during  we may continue to address opportunities in the capital markets that enable us to extend some of our larger debt maturities and reduce future interest costs 
general revenues 
our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we consider our core business to be our collection  transfer and landfill operations 
we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities 
we record revenue as services are provided  including instances where services are billed in advance of the service being provided 
the following table shows our total reported revenues by service line 
revenues by service line in millions year ended december  collection residential commercial roll off recycling total collection disposal landfill transfer total disposal recycling commodity other total revenues consists of revenue generated from commercial  industrial and residential customers from waste collected in roll off containers that are loaded onto collection vehicles 
roll off containers are generally uncovered containers that range in size from to cubic yards 
landfill revenues are presented net of landfill taxes 
we have organized our operations into four geographic areas 
our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic area 
our area  region and district management teams focus on developing local markets in which we can achieve the greatest level of internalization and operating efficiency 
as a result  we may chose to not operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met 
at december   we had operations in major markets in states 
we operate only in the united states and puerto rico 
the following table shows our revenues by geographic area in total and as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues by area in millions  except percentages years ended december  eastern southern central western other total revenues see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries which provide services throughout the organization 
operating expenses 
cost of operations includes expenses related to labor  costs to dispose of waste at third party disposal facilities  repairs and maintenance  costs of independent haulers transporting our waste to the disposal site  vehicle operating costs including fuel  landfill operating costs  safety and insurance  and other operating costs such as equipment and facility rent  utilities  environmental compliance and remediation 
landfill operating costs consists of landfill taxes  host community fees  landfill royalty payments  landfill site maintenance and other equipment operating expenses and increases in the accruals for estimated capping  closure and post closure monitoring expenses 
reimbursement from third parties  primarily insurance carriers  relating to environmental and remedial costs are included in costs of operations as an offset to environmental expenses 
in addition  gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations are included in cost of operations 
the following table provides the components of our operating costs as a percentage of our total operating costs year ended december  labor disposal repairs and maintenance transportation vehicle operating landfill operating costs safety and insurance other includes health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation 
primarily includes subcontractor costs  gain loss on sale of assets  environmental expense and related recoveries and equipment and facility rent 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and overhead for corporate and field general management  accounting and finance  legal  management information systems and clerical and administrative departments  in addition to sales  investor and community relations and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
the following table provides the components of our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of our total selling  general and administrative costs year ended december  salaries rent and office costs professional fees provision for doubtful accounts other includes health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation 
primarily includes advertising and promotion  director and officer insurance  employee relocation and bank charges 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization costs associated with the acquisition  development and retirement of landfill airspace and intangible assets 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements years  vehicles and equipment years  containers and compactors years and furniture and office equipment years 
goodwill amortization includes the amortization of costs paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired prior to july  in purchase business combinations

revenues increased in following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business decrease from average per unit price change increase from volume change net divested revenues increase in commodity and other revenues reported revenues in core business represents revenues from collection  transfer and landfill services on a same store basis 
excludes amounts reclassified to discontinued operations 
overall  during  we have continued to experience pricing pressures as a result of general economic conditions 
landfill revenues increased as a result of a increase in landfill volumes  and a slight increase in per unit pricing for when compared to revenue from the collection businesses remained fairly consistent from to with volumes and per unit pricing remaining flat 
commodity revenues increased by million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the average per unit price received for old corrugated cardboard and various grades of paper  our primary commodities and an increase in processing fees associated with a recycling contract  offset by a decline in commodity volume primarily due to the sale or closure of processing facilities 
additionally  we experienced a decrease in other revenues of million due to an increase in landfill taxes and a decrease in other non core revenues 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased by in the increase is primarily attributable to i inflationary increases in all costs  ii incremental increases in costs associated with increased volumes such as transportation  host fees and landfill operating costs and iii increases in insurance and financial assurance costs in excess of inflation rates 
these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction of million in capping  closure and post closure provision as a result of a change in accounting upon our adoption of sfas and a reduction in other operating expenses from the change in reversals of acquisition related accruals of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in the increase is primarily due to normal inflationary increases in costs primarily labor related  an increase in pension expense in excess of inflationary increases and an increase in bad debt expense 
the increase in pension expense is primarily attributable to the overall decline in the market value of our pension assets in and and the decrease in the expected long term rate of return from to these cost increases were partially offset by a reduction in other expense from the reversals of acquisition related accruals of million that we determined were no longer necessary 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in landfill amortization 
the adoption of sfas changed our accounting for landfills and resulted in an increase in landfill assets to be amortized and increased landfill volumes  both of which caused the increase in landfill amortization 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in following are the components of interest expense and other in millions for the year ended december  interest expense and other interest expense  gross cash settlement on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations interest expense and other the decrease in gross interest expense is attributable primarily to the repayment of debt from our continued de leveraging strategy 
during  we decreased our debt balance by million  causing a decrease in overall interest costs 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly through a fixed coupon and through interest rate swap contracts 
the decrease in cash settlements on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts is the result of interest swap contracts maturing 
the change in non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts is due to changes in the market value of the underlying interest rate swap contract driven by both changes in prevailing interest rates and the remaining term of the interest rate swap contract 
the decrease in amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts is attributable to de designated interest rate swap contracts that matured during costs incurred to retire debt prior to maturity in include i million for the write off of deferred financing costs and other costs for the refinancing of our credit facility and ii million in premiums paid and other costs for the open market repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes during discontinued operations 
during  we determined that some of the operations we have divested or are planning to divest of as part of our divestiture plan announced earlier in were discontinued operations 
the operations discontinued during include operations in south carolina  georgia and colorado sold at the end of second quarter  new jersey sold in the third quarter  south florida sold at the beginning of fourth quarter  north and central florida sold at the end of fourth quarter or held for sale at december   and north virginia sold at the end of fourth quarter 
discontinued operations in included a net after tax loss of approximately million million pretax for the write down of assets to fair value at the time the assets were determined to be held for sale  net of gains recorded for assets sold for which proceeds exceeded book value 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
upon adoption of sfas  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  net of income tax expense of million 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock increased by in dividends increased because in april we issued series c mandatory convertible preferred stock with dividends payable in cash 
dividends for both and reflect a dividend on the liquidation preference of our series a senior convertible preferred stock 
during and  in lieu of paying cash dividends on the series a senior convertible preferred stock  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by the amount of accrued but unpaid dividends 
in december  we completed the exchange of the series a preferred stock to common stock  which included the cumulative dividends that had been accrued 
non cash conversion of preferred stock 
during december  the series a senior convertible preferred stock was exchanged for common stock 
in connection with the exchange  we recorded a reduction to net income available to common shareholders of million for the fair value using a stock price on the date of conversion of of the million incremental shares of common stock issued to the holders of the preferred stock over the amount the holders would have received under the original conversion provisions 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased by in following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business decrease from average per unit price change increase from volume change net acquired revenues decrease in commodity and other revenues reported revenues in core business represents revenues from collection  transfer and landfill services on a same store basis 
excludes amounts reclassified to discontinued operations 
during  pricing pressures were primarily experienced in the landfill  roll off and commercial collection businesses 
the residential collection business remained fairly constant 
landfill volumes increased by  partially offset by decrease in landfill pricing when compared to commodity revenues increased as a result of increases in the average price per ton  while volumes remained fairly constant when comparing to cost of operations 
cost of operations increased by in the costs of operations included million of bfi transition costs 
these costs are not recurring costs of ongoing operations since they primarily related to the bfi transitional employees 
there were no bfi transition costs expensed during the remaining increase in cost of operations in of is attributable to an increase in overall operating costs from normal inflation that we have not been able to recover due to pricing pressures 
in addition  our annual medical  property and casualty insurance costs increased in excess of normal inflationary increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by in included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million of bfi transition costs for the year ended december  these costs are not recurring costs of ongoing operations and primarily related to the billing system conversion associated with the acquisition of bfi 
there were no bfi transition costs expensed during the increase in the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses was  which is attributable to increased costs associated with the field infrastructure expansion and higher professional fees 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in landfill volumes and increased capital expenditures 
goodwill amortization 
effective january   we discontinued the amortization of our goodwill upon the adoption of sfas non cash gain loss on divestiture of assets 
as part of our ongoing review of operations and our goal of having a self funding market development program  we sell operations from time to time 
in october  we sold certain collection operations for net proceeds of approximately million and reflected a gain of approximately million million loss on an after tax basis 
the proceeds were used to repay debt and were subsequently redeployed to purchase assets in other markets 
during february  we sold certain operations for approximately million and reflected a non cash loss of approximately million million  net of income tax benefit in the reported results for the first quarter of the proceeds were used initially to repay debt and subsequently redeployed to purchase other assets in other markets 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
on april   we completed the exchange of our minority interest in the four ref fuel facilities for the interest in our equipment purchasing subsidiaries owned by subsidiaries of american ref fuel company llc 
we no longer have any interest in the ref fuel entities and we own of the equipment purchasing subsidiaries 
during  we reported approximately million in revenues  million in operating income and million of equity earnings from american ref fuel 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in following are the components of interest expense and other in millions for the year ended december  interest expense and other interest expense  gross cash settlement of de designated interest rate swap contracts interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs non cash gain on de designated interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations interest expense and other the decrease in gross interest expense and cash settlements of de designated interest rate swap contracts is attributable primarily to the repayment of debt from our continued de leveraging strategy  partially offset by a reduction in the amount of interest we capitalized 
we reduced our debt balance by million in at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly through a fixed coupon  and through interest rate swap agreements 
on december   certain interest rate swap contracts were de designated as accounting hedges 
the non cash gain on de designated interest rate swap contracts reflects the change in market value of the underlying interest rate swap contract driven by both prevailing interest rates and the remaining term of the interest rate swap contract 
prior to de designation  the changes in market value were recorded as a component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amortization of accumulated other comprehensive income for de designated interest rate swap contracts represents the amortization of the cumulative amount of net market value remaining in equity at the time of de designation 
costs incurred to early extinguish debt are driven by the amount  terms  nature  frequency and timing of debt extinguishments 
the total costs incurred to early extinguish debt are dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of the individual transactions 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in and in the effective income tax rate of deviates from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes 
the effective income tax rate in deviated from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the non deductibility of the amortization related to billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock increased in as a result of the dividend on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock issued on july  in connection with the financing of the acquisition of bfi 
dividends were not paid in cash  instead  the liquidation preference of the preferred stock increased by accrued  but unpaid dividends 
liquidity and capital resources during  we generated operating cash flows of million  of which we reinvested million of capital into the business 
we reduced our debt balance by million to billion and increased our cash balance by million through operating cash flows  the issuance of equity of million and the divestiture of operations net of acquisitions for proceeds of million 
during  we completed various refinancing transactions and debt repayments  which combined with the effect of billion of interest rate swap contracts maturing in  will reduce our annual interest cost by over million in compared to additionally  the completed refinancing transactions extended the maturity of over billion of debt which would have come due over the next five years 
furthermore  we completed the exchange of the series a senior convertible preferred stock for common stock in december  which eliminated approximately million of future annual dividend payments that were due to begin in july in addition  in january  we used million of our ending cash balance to retire outstanding debt 
we meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flow 
our primary liquidity and capital needs are capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  debt service costs  scheduled debt maturities and capping  closure  post closure and environmental expenditures 
we have historically generated stable operating cash flows 
when we cannot meet our liquidity needs with operating cash flow  we meet those needs with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility 
we have a billion commitment until under our revolving credit facility  which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs 
at december   we had million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility  leaving million of availability 
additionally  we have a million commitment until under our institutional letter of credit facility to supplement our revolving credit facility to meet letter of credit requirements 
we continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through either improving cash flow from operations or reducing our interest cost 
historically we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing requirements 
we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
we expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent such opportunities are available to us 
our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the last three years were as follows in millions years ended december  operating activities net income discontinued operations  net of tax non cash gain loss on divestiture of assets non cash expenses gain on sale of fixed assets non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts changes in working capital capping  closure  post closure and environmental expenditures  net of provision and accretion cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations investing activities proceeds from divestitures cost of acquisitions  net of cash divested acquired accruals for acquisition price and severance costs proceeds from sale of fixed assets capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions capitalized interest change in deferred acquisition costs  notes receivable and other cash used for investing activities from continuing operations financing activities net proceeds from sale of series c preferred stock proceeds from long term debt  net of issuance costs repayments of long term debt payment of series c preferred stock dividends change in disbursement account net proceeds from sale of common stock  exercise of stock options and other cash used for financing activities from continuing operations cash provided by discontinued operations increase in cash and cash equivalents consists principally of provisions for depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs  write off of deferred debt issuance costs  non cash reduction in acquisition accruals  deferred income taxes  undistributed earnings of equity investments and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax

cash provided by continuing operations decreased by in the decrease in cash provided by continuing operations when comparing to is primarily due to a reduction in earnings  variability in working capital and the payment of approximately million of costs associated with refinancing activities 
the variability in working capital is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by decreases in expenditures for acquisition related accruals

in addition to funding our operational working capital and debt reduction needs  we are committed to investing capital in our asset base 
our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills  for the trucks and containers used by our collection operations and heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations 
following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended december  in millions trucks  containers and heavy equipment landfill development other total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions capital expenditures as a of revenues includes land and improvements  land held for permitting as landfills  buildings and improvements  and furniture and office equipment 
significant financing events in our objective to reduce our debt level and extend maturities under our credit facility was successfully met through the completion of the financing plan that we launched at the end of march the financing plan included the issuance of equity and debt and the refinancing of our credit facility as follows issuance of million shares in 
par value common stock for net proceeds of approximately million  issuance of million shares in year series c mandatory convertible preferred stock at a par value of and issued at per share for net proceeds of approximately million  issuance of million in senior notes due for net proceeds of approximately million  issuance of approximately million of receivables secured loan under an on balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program  and refinancing of our credit facility with a billion revolving credit facility due at libor plus the revolver  a billion term loan due at libor plus and a million institutional letter of credit facility at libor plus collectively  the credit facility 
the refinancing of the credit facility decreased debt maturities for the next years by over billion and increased available liquidity by approximately million 
the proceeds from the transactions listed above were used to repay term loans outstanding under the credit facility 
during august  we amended our credit facility allowing us to exchange our series a preferred stock for common stock as described below 
in addition  the amendment increased our financial flexibility by permitting us to incur an additional million of term loan indebtedness term loan c  an additional million of senior secured indebtedness and million of senior unsecured indebtedness  for the purpose of retiring portions of our outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness through optional redemption  public tender offer or open market repurchases 
during the third quarter of  we funded the million term loan c due under the credit facility and used the proceeds to repurchase a portion of our senior subordinated notes in the same amount of principal 
in connection with these repurchases  we paid premiums of approximately million 
during november  we issued million of senior secured notes due and used approximately million of the proceeds in to repurchase a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with these repurchases  we paid premiums of approximately million 
during november  we completed a second amendment to our credit facility to reduce the interest rate for the term loan b  term loan c and institutional letter of credit facility to libor plus basis points 
in addition to re pricing the term loan facilities  we favorably revised financial covenants to provide greater operating flexibility 
the transactions completed during the second half of discussed above reduced our annual interest cost by million 
financing transactions the following transactions were completed during january we repaid our million senior notes due on january  with our cash balance at december  that was generated from cash flow from operations and divestiture proceeds 
we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due in a private placement under rule a of the securities act of we will use the proceeds from the sale of these notes to redeem million of our senior notes due at a redemption price of 
upon the completion of the redemption  this transaction will extend the maturity of million from to and and reduce interest costs by approximately million annually 
we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes using the remaining proceeds from the million senior secured notes issued in november and paid premiums of approximately million related to these repurchases 
financing plan we are a highly leveraged company with billion of outstanding debt at december  the vast majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies during the past years 
we incurred and assumed over billion of debt to acquire bfi in since the acquisition of bfi  we have repaid almost billion of debt with cash flow from operations  asset sales and the issuance of equity 
we intend to continue to reduce our debt balance until we reach credit ratios that we believe will allow us to benefit from an investment grade like cost of capital 
we believe those benefits will be realized when the following ratios approach the indicated ranges debt to ebitda between and ebitda to interest between and debt to book value market capitalization between and we are unable to predict or forecast which debt rating will be assigned by the rating agencies  or when new ratings will be assigned by them 
we believe that as we move towards these ratios  when compared to today  we will have additional opportunities to reduce our cost of capital  provide opportunities to increase liquidity  and allow more flexibility in deciding the most appropriate use of our cash flow 
between now and then  we will continue to maximize operating cash flows to facilitate repayment of our scheduled debt maturities and opportunistically reduce interest costs through refinancing transactions to the extent economically beneficial 
on average over the last three years  we have generated million of annual cash flow from operations after funding capital expenditures 
because of the stability of our cash flows  we believe that over the next three years we should generate a similar average amount of annual cash flow from operations after funding capital expenditures to be used to repay debt 
we may from time to time seek to retire outstanding debt through repurchases and or exchanges for other securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
in the future  we expect to continue to acquire operations that strengthen existing markets and increase vertical integration 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate the performance and divest of operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies 
the following is our debt maturity schedule at december  compared to our pro forma debt maturity schedule at december   which considers the financing transactions completed in  the repayment of million senior notes on january   the issuance of million in senior notes during january  the anticipated redemption of million of senior notes in february  and the repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes in january in millions pro forma actual december  december  thereafter discount  net total we anticipate meeting our debt repayment requirements in through through cash flows from operations 
we will continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in and with actions that are economically beneficial 
we believe we have several alternatives available to us that will allow us to extend maturities of our debt portfolio or retire debt 
the potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations  asset sales and capital markets transactions 
capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer term maturities  issuance of equity  or a combination of both 
there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to consummate transactions in the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms or at all  sell assets or generate million of average annual cash flows to repay debt 
we currently have a shelf registration statement with the sec that would allow us to issue various securities up to million as market conditions permit

under the credit facility  we are subject to the following financial covenants minimum interest coverage from the through the ebitda quarter ending quarter ending interest march  september  x december  june  x september  september  x december  march  x june  september  x december  december  x march  june  x september  september  x december  december  x march  march  x june  june  x september  march  x june  june  x september  september  x december  thereafter x maximum leverage from the through the total debt quarter ending quarter ending ebitda march  june  x september  december  x march  june  x september  september  x december  december  x march  december  x march  june  x september  thereafter x at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit facility and our indentures 
at december   total debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the credit facility  was and our ebitda interest ratio was we are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants and we have no credit rating triggers 
ebitda used for covenants is calculated in accordance with the definition in our credit facility agreement see exhibit 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants 
failure to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility would constitute default under the credit agreement and would allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement 
in addition  maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes and  therefore  these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration of maturities of indebtedness were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  and or assets sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend the credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
prepayments 
under our credit facility  we must repay a portion of our borrowings annually prior to the stated maturity if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels 
to make these payments  if required  we may have to use the revolver to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily causing excess cash flow  as defined  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
cash flow available to repay debt in excess of the current year s maturities will be applied to future maturities 
in addition  we are required to make prepayments on the credit facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the credit facility  including asset sales and issuances of debt or equity securities 
financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirement is determined by the applicable state environmental regulations  which vary by state 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that is used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurances required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under gaap 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral required for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurance obligations during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
at december   we had the following financial assurance instruments in millions landfill closure contract risk casualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts are issued under the revolver and the institutional letter of credit facility under our credit facility 
these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of the company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments would be valued and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets if it is probable that we would be unable to perform our obligations under the financial assurance contracts 
we do not expect this to occur 
exchange of series a senior convertible preferred stock on december   we completed the exchange of the series a preferred stock outstanding for million shares of our common stock 
the series a preferred stock had a stated value of billion at december   the exchange date  which represented the original issuance amount plus cumulative accrued and unpaid dividends 
no additional common shares were issued for the increase in liquidation preference from july   the date we reached agreement on the exchange transaction with the holders of the series a preferred stock  through the exchange date 
upon completion of the exchange transaction  our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis increased to approximately million shares 
as a result of the exchange  approximately million in future annual dividend payments due to begin july have been eliminated 
the terms of the exchange were approved by a special committee of disinterested directors of our board of directors and was approved by the full board of directors 
the special committee was advised by an independent financial advisor  in connection with this transaction 
the completion of this transaction was subject to certain approvals  including approval by our shareholders 
we obtained shareholder approval at a special meeting of the shareholders on december  under the terms of the exchange agreement  the holders of the series a preferred stock are restricted from selling the shares of common stock they receive for one year from the exchange date 
due to the change in the original conversion terms  we were required to quantify the accounting effect of the change in conversion terms and reduce net income available to common shareholders by the corresponding amount 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash conversion charge of million  which is reflected as a reduction to net income available to common shareholders  but has no effect on total stockholders equity because an offsetting amount is recorded to additional paid in capital 
the non cash conversion charge is calculated as the market value of the shares of our common stock issued in excess of the shares of common stock that the holders of the series a preferred stock could have converted into under the original terms of the series a preferred stock 
off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments discussed above which are not classified as debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
interest rate swap portfolio consistent with our risk management policy  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure and meet the objectives of our risk management policy 
these contracts are not entered into for trading purposes 
our risk management policy requires that we evaluate the credit of our counter parties and that we monitor counter party exposure 
at december   counter parties for of our interest rate swap portfolio were rated aa the counter party for the remaining is rated a or aa our interest rate swap portfolio continues to fix of our variable rate interest payment obligation  protecting us from cash flow variations arising from changes in short term interest rates 
we believe this is prudent given our capital structure 
in addition  we have of our fixed rate interest payment obligations at variable interest rates through interest rate swap agreements providing us a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
our corporate policy is that at least of our total debt must be effectively fixed  either directly or through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through interest rate swap agreements 
the average interest rate paid under swap contracts at december  was compared to libor of at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative and hedging activities  a portion of our interest rate swap portfolio was de designated for hedge accounting purposes at december  certain of these contracts remain in place and continue to protect us from cash flow variability 
at the time debt obligations are repaid prior to maturity  we may or may not terminate interest rate swap contracts depending on the reflective economic considerations 
the following table outlines our interest rate swap contract roll off schedule as of december  in millions contract notional amount floating to fixed fixed to floating total total these interest rate swap contracts will roll off in as follows million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
based on the current maturity schedule of our interest rate swap contracts  our current debt balance and assuming the interest rate swap contracts are not replaced  we expect that at the end of we will have approximately of our debt at fixed interest rates 
contingencies we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july  is complete with the exception of the matter discussed below 
prior to our acquisition of bfi on july   bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to effectively manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  on july   the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis the stock over the cash proceeds received 
the capital loss was claimed in the bfi tax return for the period from october  to july  on january   the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent 
under the internal revenue service irs view  there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximately equaled the proceeds received 
we protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august if the proposed disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a potential total cash impact of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
we also received a notification from the irs proposing a penalty of of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is unlikely 
if we are unable to resolve this matter with the appeals office of the irs  we would expect to receive a notice of tax deficiency from the irs 
upon receiving the notice  we would have the following options file a petition for redetermination in tax court within days 
in this case  payments would not be required until the tax court renders its decision 
wait to receive a statement of amount due from the irs and pay the amount due 
the amount due would be based on the portion of the capital loss claimed during the bfi tax years ended september  through july  additional amounts will be owed as the audits of the company s tax returns for calendar years and forward are completed 
pay the amount due as outlined in option above  except  after paying the amount due  take appropriate steps to institute a suit in federal district court or the federal claims court for a refund of the amounts paid 
the timing of any payments for any related state tax deficiencies will generally follow closely after the timing of any federal payments 
furthermore  at any point in time under any of the options outlined above  we can attempt to reach a settlement agreement with the irs 
if we are unable to resolve this matter with the appeals office of the irs  a decision would be made at that time as to which of the above options would be pursued 
in any case  we continue to believe our position is well supported and we will vigorously contest the disallowance 
an unfavorable result should have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations as the tax and interest impact of a disallowance have been fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the normal course of conducting our landfill operations  we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings relating to the process of obtaining and defending the permits that allow us to operate our landfills 
in june  neighboring parties and the county drainage district filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent bfi from obtaining a vertical elevation expansion permit at one of our landfills in texas 
in  the expansion permit was granted 
the parties opposing the expansion permit continued to pursue their efforts in preventing the expansion permit 
in december  a judgment issued by a district court in texas  effectively revoked the expansion permit that was granted by the state of texas in and would require us to operate the landfill according to a prior permit granted in we plan to vigorously defend this expansion in the state court of appeals and believe that the merits of our position will prevail 
operationally  we are in the process of obtaining bonding that will allow us to continue to operate the landfill as usual during the period of appeals  which may continue two years or longer 
if the appeal is not successful  the landfill may become impaired  we may incur costs to relocate waste to another landfill and this matter could result in a charge of up to million to our consolidated statement of operations 
we enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses 
indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments 
certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent events or occurrences  such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that may become known in the future but that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture 
as of december   we estimate the contingent obligations associated with these indemnifications to be de minimus 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous solid waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities 
related party transactions in connection with the divestiture of our north and central florida operations for proceeds of approximately million in an arms length transaction  we terminated a consulting and non compete agreement with a former member of senior management 
in connection with the termination of these agreements we amended the terms of stock options held by the former member of senior management and recorded a non cash charge of approximately million 
for a description of other related party transactions  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
accounting for stock options granted to employees we currently account for our stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb as amended 
pursuant to apb  we recognize no compensation cost for our stock option grants to employees because the number of shares potentially issuable and the exercise price  which is equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  is fixed 
the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently considering the issue of expensing stock options 
the fasb has not issued final rules as of yet 
given the uncertainty of the final rules  management believes at this time that the best approach is to await the final fasb rules before making any change 
were we to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value of stock options granted  as provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we would have recognized compensation expense net of tax of million  million and million  or  
and 
per diluted share  for the year ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments and estimates often involve future events 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
in addition  management has discussed these accounting policies and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
no one geographic operating segment has a more significant concentration of the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time they are made 
actual results may differ significantly from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are based on our accounting practices in effect during we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent for these areas that you should be aware of and for you to consider 
residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that remains after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk landfill accounting on january   we adopted sfas  which outlines standards for accounting for our landfill retirement obligations  which we have historically referred to as closure and post closure 
upon adoption  sfas required a cumulative change in accounting principle for landfill obligations retroactive to the date of the inception of the landfill  including the creation of a related landfill asset  net of accumulated amortization 
the cumulative effect of adoption represents the difference between the amount of our landfill related assets and liabilities calculated under sfas and the balances previously reported 
liabilities retained from divested landfills that were historically accounted for in closure and post closure liabilities were reclassified to other long term obligations because they were not within the scope of sfas additionally  methane gas collection systems are no longer included in closure and post closure cost estimates  but instead are now included in the landfill development asset and the cost of financial assurance instruments are no longer accrued as part of the post closure liability  but rather expensed as incurred 
at january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle gain of approximately million  net of tax 
in addition  we recorded a decrease in our capping  closure and post closure liabilities of approximately million  an increase in other long term obligations of approximately million  and a decrease in our net landfill assets of approximately million 
our landfill investments fall into two categories  each of which require accounting judgments and estimates 
landfill development asset and related amortization 
landfill retirement asset resulting from recording our capping  closure and post closure liabilities and related amortization 
we use the life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
in life cycle accounting  all capitalizable costs to acquire  develop and retire a site are recorded to accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk amortization expense based upon the consumption of disposal capacity 
the cost of the assets and liabilities related to landfills is driven by the technical design that is developed by a third party consultant and approved by a regulatory agency 
the technical design includes the construction  capping and closure specifications  the types and quantities of materials required and determination of the landfill capacity 
estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically generally annually based on third party aerial surveys 
landfill development asset and related amortization site permit and technical design in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to obtain a landfill permit 
studies performed by third parties could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit 
revocation of a permit could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill 
technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to meet new design standards 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical design  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
third party designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit 
landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are the factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on an average expected density to be achieved over the operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  leachate collection system construction  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates used in the annual update of the above costs by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  review changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and compare our resulting development cost per acre with prior periods 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization in order to match the amortization of the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted increases and decreases in our cost estimates and changes in disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates on a accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value and estimated future development costs as described above of the landfill by the estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to amortization expense 
prospective basis 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could effect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment 
amortization rates per ton are influenced by the original cost basis for the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions in recent years and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
also  per ton rates are influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in the cost estimates are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure monitoring 
landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
capping activities primarily include installation of liners  drainage  compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total disposal capacity has been consumed and waste is no longer being received 
there are multiple capping activities that occur over the operating life of the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk closure and post closure monitoring closure costs are any costs incurred after a site stops receiving waste but prior to being certified as closed and enters its post closure monitoring period 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which may extend for years 
post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring the methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas systems operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement  obligation asset amortization under sfas  there are five accounting processes a retirement obligation is recorded for the present value of the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs as the liability for such costs is incurred capping costs are accrued for each specific capping event  whereas  closure and post closure costs are accrued over the operating life of the landfill  a retirement obligation asset is recorded  in addition to the landfill development asset  for the same value as the retirement obligation liability  the projected total capping  closure and post closure assets to be recorded over the life of the landfill are amortized to amortization expense as disposal capacity is consumed  the liability recorded is accreted to reflect the passage of time  and actual cash expenditures are charged against the recorded liability as they are incurred 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in future inflation rate projections could impact our actual future costs and our total liability 
changes in our capital structure could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in our recorded liabilities and expense 
for each landfill  the following according processes are applied estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close  and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are developed annually 
the estimates include the specific timing of the estimated future cash outflows  considering the anticipated waste flow into the capping events and the landfill 
in  an inflation rate of was used to estimate future costs and a credit change in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations as new information becomes available 
this could result in accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk adjusted risk free rate of was used to present value the total future costs 
unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for a specific capping event and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are accrued as retirement obligations as the liability for capping  closure and post closure monitoring are incurred on a per ton basis 
this liability is incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
a corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the retirement obligation liability as disposal capacity is consumed 
the total landfill asset is comprised of the landfill development asset and the retirement obligation asset 
using our projected waste flow into the capping events and the landfill and the projected total capping and closure and post closure assets  we develop a per ton rate that is used to record amortization expense as waste is received at the landfill 
the retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect to passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to discount the projected costs 
this accretion expense is charged to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are incurred 
rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill closure design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs are treated prospectively for our operating landfills but are recorded immediately in results of operations for full incurred capping events and closed landfills since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
disposal capacity as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relates to additional disposal capacity being sought through means of an expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permit or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could cause an asset impairment 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
non recurring acquisition accruals nature of liabilities at the time of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we evaluate and adjust existing accruals of the acquired company to represent our estimate of the future costs to settle the assumed obligations  which represents fair value 
assumed liabilities as well as liabilities resulting directly from the completion of the acquisition are considered in the net assets acquired and resulting purchase price allocation 
there could be changes in circumstances or estimates that cause the actual settlement of these liabilities to be higher or lower than our original estimates 
liabilities resulting from changes in estimates of assumed obligations  including litigation  self insurance reserves and loss contracts  as well as liabilities related to restructuring and additional liabilities may exist related to the acquired operations that have not been identified 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk abandonment activities  are accrued through a charge to expense 
additionally  transition costs that are not accruable at the time of acquisition  including transitional personnel costs  route restructurings and costs associated with the consolidation of operations are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
estimate updates we evaluate the adequacy of the non recurring acquisition accruals at least annually by obtaining third party actuarial valuations of assumed self insurance obligations  third party legal counsel updates for assumed litigation and field and corporate management reviews of all acquisition related commitments 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
the adjustment is charged to either an expense or goodwill consistent with how the original liability was established and the period of time that has elapsed since the date of the acquisition 
generally  we do not record adjustments to goodwill after one year from the date of the acquisition 
summary at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of non recurring acquisition accruals remaining on our balance sheet  consisting primarily of loss contracts  litigation and compliance  and risk management and insurance liabilities associated with the acquisition of bfi 
cash paid against non recurring acquisition accruals  including severance  in was million and million in environmental liabilities nature of liabilities liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills that we or a predecessor company have delivered or transported waste to and are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for incremental remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site and the most appropriate remedy 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk reasonably estimable 
the majority of our environmental liabilities are liabilities that we assumed in connection with an acquisition 
any increases in the assumed accruals for environmental liabilities from the amounts recorded by the predecessor are charged to operating expense 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are also charged to operating expense 
future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense 
estimate updates we periodically consult with outside legal counsel and environmental engineers to review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of resolution 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the accrued costs are not discounted 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
cash paid for environmental matters during and was million and million  respectively 
we do not expect that adjustments to estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible the ultimate outcome of environmental matters  excluding capping  closure and post closure could result in approximately million of additional liability 
due to the nature of these matters  the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely be over a period greater than five years 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk self insurance liabilities and related costs we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability  and workers compensation insurance and are fully self insured for employee group health claims 
deductible levels are between million and million 
the retained or non insured portion of the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is reflected in our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation is actuarially determined by a third party actuary 
we use a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the expense is charged to operating costs 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated for the most part by our past claims experience factor  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the costs to discharge our obligations  including legal costs and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current and or prior estimates of our self insurance liability to change 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of self insurance liabilities on our balance sheet 
cash paid for self insurance claims during and was million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess potential liability 
management s assessment is developed in consultation with the company s outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
actual costs can vary from estimates for a variety of reasons 
for example  the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages 
generally  we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we provide services to approximately million customers throughout the united states 
we perform credit evaluations of our significant customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our receivables  payment performance factors  historical trends and other information 
in general  we reserve of receivables outstanding to days and of those outstanding over days 
we also review specific outstanding accounts and reserve the receivable if information becomes available indicating we will not receive payment 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
adverse changes in the financial health of our customers could change the timing or levels of collections and require adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill see discussion below is our investment in landfills 
a reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events could trigger an impairment charge 
goodwill impairment valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each geographic operating segment 
our geographic operating segment is an aggregate of several vertically integrated businesses with similar operational characteristics 
we estimate fair value based on net cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of the estimated fair value could change as there are future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted  actual capital expenditure levels  or our market capitalization 
for accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk approximately 
in addition  consideration is also given to an earnings multiple approach  enterprise value and overall company market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows 
evaluation criteria annually  we test realizability of goodwill 
in addition  we test goodwill for recoverability between annual evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in legal factors  liquidity or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of an operating segment or a significant portion of a geographic operating segment 
example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value to below carrying value  which would trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge 
recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value as determined using discounted future cash flows on a geographic operating segment basis in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the assets divested 
if similar divestiture decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
a divestiture of any individual asset below the geographic operating segment level could result in a loss 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a geographic operating segment  goodwill is allocated to that business unit and a gain or loss on disposal is derived 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the geographic operating segment from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could also result in an additional loss 
summary at december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  of goodwill recorded 
upon adoption of sfas at january   we had no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  at december  and  there was no impairment of goodwill upon completion of our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax basis of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk defined benefit pension plans using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets including net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future deduction giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for actual or expected probable tax adjustments proposed by tax authorities at the federal and state level 
the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a business purchase combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which the amortization is non deductible 
at december   approximately billion of non deductible goodwill remains on our balance sheet 
income tax expense is recorded on an interim basis based on the expected annual effective tax rate 
the annual effective tax rate is determined using estimated full year earnings  non deductible items and tax credits that are anticipated to be utilized 
summary as of december   net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million remain unused that will expire if not used by the end of various future years 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that some of these carryforwards may not be used 
recognition criteria our defined benefit retirement plan was assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the benefits of approximately of the plan participants were frozen upon acquisition 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense is actuarially determined by an independent third party based on actuarial assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we use a third party to administer the plan and maintain certain data that is provided to the of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in balance sheet reclassifications  which may include an adjustment to goodwill 
changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in additional income tax expense 
we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
positions taken in tax years under examination are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
actual income tax rates can vary from period to period as a result of differences between estimated and actual earnings  non deductible items and tax credit utilization 
an increase or decrease in the tax rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk actuary 
the plan assets are managed by a third party that is unaffiliated to our actuary 
we recognize in our financial statements an accrued liability or a prepaid pension expense  for the difference between the cost to satisfy our pension obligation and the investment income earned or contributions to the plan 
pension income or expense is recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
our funding policy is to make annual contributions to the pension plan as determined to be required by the plan s actuary and to meet the minimum requirements of erisa 
no contributions were required during the last three years 
no contributions are anticipated for the plan s policy is to invest the plan s assets as determined by our benefits committee 
at december   of the total plan assets of million  approximately was invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately in equity funds 
assumptions the assumptions used in the actuarial determined funded status are as follows weighted average assumptions as of our measurement date  september changes in our investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
discount rate expected return on plan assets average rate of compensation increase our discount rate represents the yield on high quality aaa bonds at which our obligation could be settled 
our discount rate is based on a review of the current rate of long term bonds which have durations that are equivalent to our obligations under the plan 
our discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase the liability and decrease the funded status of the plan 
the expected return on our plan assets represents a long term view of returns based on our current asset mix 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluated an analysis of long term expected and historical actual returns on the plan assets from our investment managers which gave consideration to our asset mix and anticipated length of obligation of our plan 
if actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns  the fair value of the plan assets will differ from our projections 
accounting accounting policy and process residual accounting and area use of estimates business risk the average rate of compensation increase applies only to the portion of the plan that is not frozen 
less than of the plan participants continue to earn benefits 
this rate reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned 
changes in our key assumptions could cause changes in our assets  liabilities and income or expense recorded 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in a greater benefits obligation and more pension expense in future periods 
a lower expected return on assets would also increase the amount of pension expense recorded 
we annually review our actual asset allocation  discount rate  expected rate of return and other actuarial assumptions and adjust them as deemed necessary 
new accounting standards for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements this form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements 
all statements  other than statements of historical fact included in this report  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
generally  these forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding our business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  including our market specific acquisitions and divestitures  our ability to obtain financing  refinance existing debt  reduce interest cost  accelerate our de leveraging process  and to extend our larger debt materials in and  the adequacy of our operating cash flow and revolving credit facility to make payments on our indebtedness and fund other liquidity needs  our expectation of the amounts we will spend on capital expenditures  closure  post closure and remediation expenditures related to landfill operations in  our ability to generate cash flows from operations after funding capital expenditures at similar level as what we generated over the last three years  our ability at the end of to have of our debt at fixed interest rates  our ability to increase revenue growth and internal growth by increasing volumes collected and disposed and by increasing the rates for the services we provide  our ability to pay cash dividends in the future  our expectation that we may become an investment grade company in the future  our ability to achieve credit ratios that would allow us to receive benefits of a crossover investment grade company and or investment grade like cost of capital  our estimates of future expenses  including amortization expense  our ability to achieve cost reductions in the future  our estimates of future annual interest cost reductions  our ability to perform our obligations under financial assurance contracts and our expectation that financial assurance contracts will not materially increase  underlying assumptions including internal growth as well as general economic and financial market conditions  our expectation that our casualty  property or environmental claims or other contingencies will not have a material effect on our operations  our estimate of federal and state income taxes and penalties required to be paid if we do not prevail in our appeal of the irs disallowance of capital losses related to bfi  and our belief that the costs of settlements or judgments arising from litigation and the effects of settlements or judgments on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operation will not be material 
all phases of our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside of our control and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of our operations 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed below 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitation our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business 
we have had and will likely continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion and our debt to total capitalization was 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt is not hedged  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry  limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain other financing capacity  and subject us to a greater risk of noncompliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material negative effect on us 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
as of december   our debt agreements permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness under various financial ratio tests 
as of december   we had no cash draws outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility 
as of such date  we had million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility that support financial assurance purposes  leaving million of availability 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may also need to refinance our senior notes  our senior subordinated notes and or other indebtedness to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
covenants in our credit facility  our indentures and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facility  and certain of the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless we satisfy certain financial tests or other criteria 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
our credit facility and these other agreements contain additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make acquisitions and capital expenditures 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under our credit facility and other debt agreements and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under such credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness under such credit facility or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes most of the assets we own  including the stock and assets of our subsidiaries 
in addition  any default under our credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
we compete with large companies and municipalities that may have greater financial and operational resources 
we also compete with the use of alternatives to landfill disposal in part because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at currently estimated volumes 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive 
we compete with large companies and municipalities which may have greater financial and operational resources 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is led by three large national waste management companies allied  waste management  inc  and republic services  inc 
it also includes numerous regional and local companies 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax exempt financing and may control the disposal of waste collected within their jurisdictions 
we encounter competition due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and incineration  because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot ensure that our landfills will continue to operate at currently estimated volumes 
further  most of the states or municipalities in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard wastes  at landfills 
these actions may reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  there can be no assurances that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for services 
if we are unable to execute our business strategy  our waste disposal expenses could increase significantly 
over the long term  our ability to continue to sustain our current vertical integration strategy will depend on our ability to maintain appropriate landfill capacity  collection operations and transfer stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace such assets either timely or cost effectively or integrate acquisition candidates effectively or profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding the permitted capacity of our current landfills once our landfill capacity is full 
in such event  we may have to dispose of collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to another of our landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal expenses 
we may be unable to obtain required permits or to expand existing permitted capacity 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other regulatory measures 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations 
the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry that may consume cash from our operations and borrowings 
our ability to remain competitive  grow and expand operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
we spent approximately million in combination for our capital expenditures and landfill capping  closure  and post and remediation expenditures during  and we expect to spend approximately million for these purposes in if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  and post closure and remediation expenditures will increase 
acquisitions may increase our capital requirements because acquisitions may require sizable amounts of capital and competition with other solid waste companies that have a similar acquisition strategy may increase costs 
increases in expenditures may result in low levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits 
we intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations  to fund our operations and or to growth our business 
our cash needs will increase if the expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring increase above the reserves recorded for these costs 
expenditures for these costs may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action  including changes in closing or monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used or the period of required post closure monitoring 
these factors  together with those discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing facilities or new facilities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
in addition  we are required to provide financial assurances for our self insurance program 
we satisfy the financial assurances requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
as of december   we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the financial assurances that we need and we do not have any indications that we will not have continued availability of these types of instruments 
however  we cannot make any assurances that the level of financial assurance that we are required to provide will be available in the future 
changes in interest rates may effect our results of operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly and through interest rate swap agreements 
the amount of this swap contract portfolio was billion 
for certain interest rate swap agreements  we record non cash mark to market gains and losses based on changes in future yield curves to the statement of operations 
changes in the yield curves could result in additional non cash losses being recorded in the statement of operations 
us economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
weakness in the us economy has had a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows 
additionally  as is expected in a down cycle economic environment  we have experienced the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or fail to recover  we will continue to experience pressure on the pricing that we are able to achieve for our services 
in addition  worsening economic conditions may lead to further negative effects of customer turnover 
there can be no assurance that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
additionally  there can be no assurance that an improvement in economic conditions will result in an immediate  if at all  positive improvement in our operating results 
we may be affected by adverse weather conditions 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
severe weather can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
we depend highly upon our senior management team 
we will continue to depend on operations management personnel with waste industry experience 
we do not know the availability of such experienced management personnel or how much it may cost to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and environmental litigation 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with these regulatory requirements is costly 
government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or our permits and licenses may be modified or revoked 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and surrounding landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit or limit importing out of state waste to be disposed of and may require states  under some circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdictions to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are greater than our insurance coverage 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage of environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may have additional hazardous substances liability 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under the cercla and analogous state laws 
cercla provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility and on persons who transport such substances to the facility 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
as used in this report  non hazardous waste means substances that are not defined as hazardous waste under federal regulations 
the statute provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes costs on the responsible parties 
the expense of conducting such a cleanup can be significant 
we have significant liabilities under these laws  primarily due to acquired businesses and properties and their former operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by acquired companies 
in addition  actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes 
there may be undisclosed liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition made by us  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or are unable to discover including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners and for which we  as successor owner  may be responsible 
similarly  we incur capitalized costs associated with acquisitions  which may never be consummated  resulting in a potential charge to earnings 
we are subject to examination by various federal and state taxing authorities 
we are currently under examination by various federal and state taxing authorities for certain tax years 
any material disagreement with a taxing authorities could result in large cash expenditures and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a federal income tax audit for the calendar years through is ongoing 
a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july   is completed with the exception of the following matter 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of a capital loss included in bfi s july  tax return 
if such disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a potential total cash impact of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
we also received a notification from the irs proposing a penalty of of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
we believe that the resolution of this matter may entail efforts over several years 
an unfavorable result of this matter could require future potential cash expenditures that could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
fluctuations in commodity prices could affect our operating results 
as part of our recycling services  we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties  generally at current market prices 
all of these materials are subject to significant price fluctuations  which are driven by general market conditions 
these price fluctuations may affect our future operating income and cash flows 
we may be subject to work stoppages  which could increase our operating costs and disrupt our operations 
as of december   approximately of our workforce was represented by various local labor unions 
if our unionized workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown in the future  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and an increase in our operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
we are required to make accounting estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business 
the accounting estimates and judgments we must make in the ordinary course of business affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of our operating results during the periods presented as described under critical accounting judgments and estimates above 
additionally  we are required to interpret the accounting rules in existence as of the date of the financial statements when the accounting rules are not specific to a particular event or transaction 
if the underlying estimates are ultimately proved to be incorrect  or if auditors or regulators subsequently interpret our application of accounting rules differently  subsequent adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified 
additionally  subsequent adjustments could require us to restate our financial statements 
restating our financial statements could result in a material change in our stock price 
the adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations could adversely impact our results of operations 
our implementation of new accounting rules and interpretations or compliance with changes in the existing accounting rules could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations  or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions our objective is to be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors have and may continue to require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
as a result  we have been unable to implement price increases sufficient to offset cost increases resulting from inflation 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we have effectively converted a significant portion of our long term debt  which required payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
during  these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
in addition  during we entered into interest rate swap contracts that convert fixed rate debt to variable interest rates to effectively manage the percentage of our debt portfolio that is fixed rate terms 
under these transactions  we are required to pay variable rates on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us the fixed rates of interest on the same notional amount of principal 
increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact earnings and cash flow in as a significant portion of variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
the following interest rate table summarizes all interest rate swaps that were in effect and their fair value as of december  fair market notional value principal interest underlying interest asset liability in millions maturity paid obligations received in millions november november senior notes credit agreement  march march term loan facility libor at december   with of our debt fixed either directly or through interest rate swap agreements  we have million of floating rate debt 
if interest rates increased by basis points  annualized interest expense would increase by million million after tax 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
accordingly  any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on our net income
