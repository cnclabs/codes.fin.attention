item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto and item selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
additional information concerning factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements is contained under item business risk factors 
overview we were founded in september  to create a national  single source provider of document and information outsourcing solutions to document and information intensive industries  including healthcare insurance  financial services  healthcare provider  transportation logistics  federal and state government  and legal industries 
we acquired the seven founding companies the founding companies simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering the ipo on january   and effectively began operations at that time 
the consideration for the founding companies consisted of a combination of cash and common stock of our company 
since the ipo  we have acquired companies and divested operating units by sales or closures 
we evaluate candidates for acquisition and periodically for divestiture as a part of our strategic plan of providing customers a single solution for business process outsourcing and knowledge based processing and consulting services 
the criteria for evaluation include geographic need  additional technology  market growth potential  industry expertise  service expansion to broaden service offerings  expansion of our customer base  revenue and earnings growth potential  and expected sources and uses of capital 
business segments we aggregate our service offerings and operations into two reportable segments i information management and distribution  and ii healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance 
service offerings are aggregated when they are similar in the following areas economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  methods for distributing or delivering products  and type or class of customers 
we evaluate segment performance based on revenue  operating income  and income before income taxes 
all centrally incurred corporate costs are allocated to the segments based principally on operating income 
the reporting segments follow the same accounting policies used for our consolidated financial statements as described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
at january   we transferred four operating units from the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment to the information management and distribution segment and one operating unit from the information management and distribution segment to the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
these transfers were completed to better align these operating units results with operating units of similar core competencies 
the identified segments are as follows information management and distribution 
we offer business process outsourcing bpo solutions that help our customers manage the document in flow  workflow processing and statement out flow of their mission critical business document processes 
our bpo solutions enable customers to automate their complex workflow processes by digitizing extremely large volumes of documents  capturing information from the documents  hosting electronic documents on our web based repository  and preparing statements that customers mail or present electronically to their end users 
in conjunction with statement out flow  we provide full service printing and direct mail services 
we offer our bpo solutions to businesses in document intensive industries  such as healthcare insurance  financial services  healthcare provider  transportation logistics  and federal and state government 
in  information management and distribution represented of revenue and of pre tax income 
project revenue accounted for of the segment s revenue with recurring revenue accounting for the remaining during healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance 
we offer specialized knowledge based processing and consulting services that include medical records release  record management services for healthcare institutions  temporary staffing for healthcare institutions  providing managed care compliance reviews  class action claims administration  and professional economic research and litigation services 
in  healthcare regulatory and legal compliance represented of revenue and of pre tax income 
the greater proportion of pre tax income results from the higher margin nature of project revenue 
project revenue accounted for of the segment s revenue with recurring revenue accounting for the remaining during results of operations the following table sets forth certain items as shown in item selected financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue cost of services special charges depreciation gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges amortization operating income loss interest and other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss cost of services consists primarily of compensation and benefits to employees providing goods and services to our clients  occupancy costs  equipment costs  and supplies 
our cost of services also includes the cost of products sold for micrographics supplies and equipment  computer hardware and software  and business imaging supplies and equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist primarily of compensation and related benefits to sales and marketing  executive management  accounting  human resources and other administrative employees  other sales and marketing costs  communications costs  insurance costs  and legal and accounting professional fees and expenses 
special charges represent expenses and asset write downs associated with the strategic realignment plan 
we sold or closed operating units pursuant to this plan 
special charges consist primarily of net loss or gain on sale or closure  other asset write downs  and accrued contingencies such as legal claims  contract termination costs and various disposal expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue our revenue possesses both project and recurring characteristics 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue margins are usually higher than our average margins and the workload can be highly volatile 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements and predominately occurs within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on transaction volumes sent to us by our customers at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customers volumes are generally not contractually or otherwise guaranteed 
recurring revenue typically possesses lower margins than project revenue but is usually more predictable 
total revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  lower recurring revenue was the primary reason for the revenue decline 
we experienced significantly lower volumes within our print and mail service offering in addition to the loss of our service contract with the city of new york s human resource administration 
these two factors resulted in a recurring revenue decrease of million or 
project revenue increased modestly at million or primarily due to stronger revenue performance from our class action claims administration and professional economic research and litigation support service offerings 
revenue within our information management and distribution segment decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the major contributing factors for declining revenue were lower volumes within our print and mail service offering  and the loss of our service contract with the city of new york s human resource administration 
our print and mail service offering continues to experience lower business volumes due to a decline in demand related to us companies reduction in direct mail marketing spending 
this trend began during early as a result of the economic recession and was further complicated by the september  terrorist attacks 
in addition to lowering customer demand for print and mail services  this trend has created overcapacity within the print and mail industry resulting in significant pricing pressures 
as of december   we have yet to experience a change in this trend or identify indicators that would suggest a near term turnaround for this service offering 
during  revenue from our print and mail service offering declined million or 
additionally  during the third quarter of  the city of new york s human resource administration informed us that we did not receive their renewal contract award 
the contract was transitioned to the new vendor during the second quarter of resulting in million of lower revenue for the year within our information management service offering 
this contract contributed million of revenue during versus million during and will not contribute any revenue in other factors contributing to lower revenue within our information management service offering include non repeating project work representing a decline of million  lower volumes from transportation customers representing a decline of million  and lower revenue from credit card customers representing a decline of million 
partially offsetting the factors driving lower revenue was strong revenue growth from our mortgage industry customers for data capture and repository services 
during we added several new mortgage applications for current and new customers 
revenue from our mortgage services customers increased approximately million when compared to we also experienced strong revenue growth from our statement processing service offering 
during  revenue from our statement processing service offering increased or million 
project revenue accounted for of the information management and distribution segment s revenue in compared to in revenue within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to higher project revenue within our class action claims administration and professional economic research and litigation support service offerings 
during  these service offerings collectively increased million or derived from several large matters related to large  multi national clients 
offsetting the strong revenue achievement from these service offerings was lower revenue performance from our medical coding and release of medical information service offerings that declined million or during increased competition at the local market level was the primary factor driving the decline from prior year 
however  we expect to continue to leverage our market position through a centralized  low cost model more fully integrated with electronic document and data management solutions 
project revenue accounted for of the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment s revenue in compared to in gross profit gross profit increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our gross profit benefited from a higher mix of project revenue  which historically produces higher margins than our recurring business 
additionally  we began productivity initiatives during aimed at lowering the labor component of our production cost structures 
examples of these initiatives include deployment of our high speed scanning solution  development of common production control systems including optical character recognition technology  pay for performance pay strategies  and strategic offshore vendor relationships 
collectively  these initiatives and lower revenue resulted in lower production personnel costs of million or when compared with personnel costs 
we also lowered the amount of bad debt expense incurred during our heightened focus for improved accounts receivable collections has benefited operating cash flow and had the effect of lowering bad debt expense million during significant factors offsetting the areas of gross profit improvement were higher employee medical insurance costs in the amount of million and higher worker s compensation and business insurance in the amount of million 
consequently  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  our sg a increased primarily from higher personnel costs related to our company wide internal revenue growth initiatives and the technology based productivity initiatives that improved gross profit within our information management and distribution operating segment 
when compared to  personnel costs increased million driving the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue 
operating income operating income decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the year over year decline relates to the improvement in gross profit offset by the higher sg a expense discussed above 
while the sales and productivity initiatives resulted in higher gross profit  the investment in sg a more than offset the in year benefit 
however  these investments were important in order to drive internal revenue growth and profitability in future years 
interest and other expense interest and other expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower balances on long term obligations  a lower interest rate environment  and the expiration of our interest rate hedge 
the average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in our interest rate on borrowings were predominantly variable in nature with the exception of the interest rate hedge which expired during march see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
therefore  interest rate risk exists for our long term obligations at december  increases in short term rates would have the effect of increasing interest expense and lowering operating results in future periods 
income before income taxes income before income taxes improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due to the reduction in interest expense and the improvement in gross profit offset by the increase in sg a expense discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  divested operating units and lower project revenue contributed million and million  respectively  to the decline 
recurring revenue increased million reflecting a shift in revenue mix between our project and recurring revenue 
revenue within our information management and distribution segment increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to strong business volumes from our government and mortgage industry customers and the strategic acquisition of united information services uis  a provider of statement processing services  during the first quarter of segment revenues were negatively impacted by print and mail volumes that were down million or compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in industry spending  especially since september   and to customers reduced advertising budgets resulting from continued softness in the current economic environment 
during the third quarter of  the city of new york human resources administration informed us that we did not receive their renewal contract award 
this contract contributed million of revenue in the information management and distribution segment in and transitioned to the new vendor during the second quarter of project revenue accounted for of the information management and distribution segment s revenue in compared to in revenue within our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to lower project revenue within our legal claims administration services  which was down approximately million 
several large legal claims administration cases were completed during while the current year consisted mostly of medium size projects with one large project during the third and fourth quarters of the lower project revenue in our legal claims administration services was partially offset by increased volumes from our healthcare medical coding services and from our legal consulting and compliance services 
project revenue accounted for of the healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment s revenue in compared to in gross profit gross profit decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  divested operating units contributed million or to the decline 
gross profit decreased an additional million or primarily due to lower project revenue  which historically produces higher margins than our recurring business  lower volumes from print and mail services and pricing pressures primarily in the information management and distribution segment 
other significant factors contributing to lower gross profit in include higher employee medical insurance costs of million and increased worker s compensation insurance expense of million 
consequently  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million  or of revenue for the year ended december  to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  overall our sg a increased from higher medical insurance costs of million and higher performance based incentive compensation of million  offset by expense control and reduction initiatives implemented during the first quarter of and million of sg a costs incurred by operating units divested during other factors contributing to higher sg a costs include i an unfavorable court ruling involving an isolated legal matter in our healthcare  regulatory and legal compliance segment resulting in sg a expense of million related to legal and interest costs  and ii higher personnel related costs of million in our information management and distribution segment related to sales and marketing  operational project management and technology personnel to support the information management growth strategy 
operating income loss operating income loss improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the year over year improvement relates to the million of special charges incurred during from the divestitures and closures  and the elimination of goodwill amortization during as a result of adopting sfas no 
offsetting the favorable items were the decline in project revenue in our legal claims administration services  the overall shift in revenue mix from higher margin project revenue to lower margin recurring revenue  pricing pressures primarily in the information management and distribution segment  and the higher sg a expenses discussed above 
interest and other expense interest and other expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower balances on long term obligations  lower interest rates and the write down of million of deferred debt costs due to refinancing long term obligations in the average interest rate on borrowings decreased from in to in the interest rate on borrowings is predominantly variable in nature with the exception of the interest rate hedge which was placed in effect during december  effectively fixing the interest cost for million of long term obligations through march see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
however  interest rate risk exists for the remaining million of long term obligations at december  increases in short term rates would have the effect of increasing interest expense and lowering operating results in future periods 
income loss before income taxes income loss before income taxes improved from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   largely due to the items discussed above 
pro forma results to reflect divestitures and special charges the consolidated gaap results for include  through the effective date of divestiture  the operating units that were divested in the second and third quarters of as the strategic realignment plan was completed in  the consolidated gaap results for represent our ongoing results that exclude the results from operations of the divested companies and closed facilities through the effective date of divestiture or closure  and the related special charges from the divestitures and closures 
in order to provide year over year comparability  the following table presents pro forma ongoing results 
we believe this presentation is meaningful in analyzing trends in our ongoing operations and the best measure for determining future operating performance 
year ended december  consolidated gaap pro forma adjustments pro forma results consolidated gaap pro forma adjustments pro forma results in thousands revenue      gross profit      sg a      operating income loss     interest and other expense  net    income loss before tax     fluctuations in quarterly results of operations revenue from our services shows no overall significant seasonal variations  however  some seasonality exists at the operating unit level 
further  service revenue can vary from period to period due to the impact of specific projects and the level of transaction volumes sent to us by our customers 
quarterly results may also vary as a result of the timing of acquisitions and the timing and magnitude of costs related to such acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital  including million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to significant cash collections of aged accounts receivable in that provided million of operating cash flow benefit 
days sales outstanding improved day to business days at december  compared to business days at december  providing only million of operating cash flow benefit during as a result of the significant collection improvements experienced in and  operating cash flow was higher than what we believe to be sustainable levels 
therefore  we expect operating cash flow in to be in the range of million to million 
for the year ended december   investing activities consisted primarily of additions to property  plant and equipment of million and acquisition related payments of million 
during  we made investments in high speed scanning systems in order to increase productivity in our information management service offering and expanded our production facilities through the addition of major facilities in burbank  ca  denver  co  and irving  tx 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
acquisition related payments consisted primarily of settlements of contingent consideration obligations on past acquisitions 
not all of the periods applicable for contingent consideration targets have been completed and additional amounts may be payable in future periods under the terms of the agreements 
if all contingent consideration targets under the current agreements were achieved  the maximum amount of consideration to be paid would be million  with approximately million to be paid in and approximately million to be paid in in accordance with the agreements  we would be required to satisfy approximately million of the million potential liability in common stock related to a past tax free stock merger and we have the option to satisfy million of the million potential liability in common stock with final valuation determined at date of issuance 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december  we made payments for common stock repurchases of million 
in april  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
under this program  share repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market as market conditions warrant 
repurchased shares will be retired and restored to the status of authorized but unissued shares of the company 
during  we activated the share repurchase program and repurchased  shares at an average cost of per share including  shares repurchased during the three months ended december  at an average price of per share 
additionally  we made payments of million on our line of credit  net of proceeds borrowed from our line of credit of million 
we utilize our line of credit to fund general operating requirements of the company as well as fund significant investments such as acquisitions or capital expenditures 
at december   we had million of working capital  including million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our focus on shortening the order to cash cycle resulting in improved collections in accounts receivable 
net accounts receivable were million at december  compared to million at december  our days sales outstanding improved days to business days at december  compared to business days at december  during the year ended december   million of uncollectible trade receivables were written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while these write offs had no impact on cash flows or operating results during  these write offs lowered our cash taxes paid during due to the related tax deduction 
for the year ended december   investing activities consisted primarily of additions to property  plant and equipment of million and acquisition related payments of million 
acquisition related payments consist of the purchase of uis in the first quarter of and certain other cash payments related to contingent consideration agreements of past acquisitions 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily related to payments of million on our line of credit  net of proceeds borrowed from our line of credit of million 
at december   we had million of working capital and million of cash 
cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily impacted by cash savings from tax planning and strong cash flow from recent acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of payments of million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
these outflows were offset by the net proceeds received from the sale of operating units 
net proceeds from sale of operating units were used for payment on the credit facility resulting in net cash provided by financing activities of million 
net reductions in debt were million for the year 
in april  we entered into a line of credit agreement with bank of america  suntrust bank and wells fargo bank  as co agents the credit agreement 
under this agreement  we can from time to time borrow up to million through april   subject to certain financial covenants and ratios 
meeting these requirements is highly dependent upon maintaining a minimum level of operating results and the continued demand for our services  among other factors 
our ability to borrow is contingent on certain leverage and fixed cost coverage ratios 
these ratios were scheduled to become more restrictive beginning in the quarter ended december  with the leverage ratio declining from times to times and the fixed charge coverage ratio increasing from times to times 
however  in september  an amendment was approved that extended the fixed cost coverage ratio requirement of until january  and will increase to at all times thereafter 
in addition to the leverage and fixed cost coverage ratios  we are subject to minimum net worth requirements 
effective march   an amendment was approved that allows for the reduction to the minimum net worth requirement for up to million of share repurchases 
after application of such ratios and our total commercial commitments of million for standby letters of credit  we had million available to borrow under the credit agreement as of december  management believes that it has sufficient liquidity from its cash flow and its revolving credit facility to meet ongoing business needs 
additionally  depending on the mix of stock and cash used in our strategic acquisition program  if any  we may need to seek further financing through the public or private sale of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance we could secure such financing if and when it is needed or with terms we deem acceptable 
effective april   we extended million of the million commitment for an additional year to april  in september  additional extensions were granted by member banks  bringing the total commitment extended to april  to million 
total fees paid in related to the extensions and amendments to the credit agreement were million 
effective april   we extended million of the million commitment to april  during the fourth quarter of  a participating bank in the credit agreement assigned million of its commitment to another bank who  effective december   extended this commitment to april  total fees paid in related to the extensions and amendments to the credit agreement were million 
management fully expects to replace or refinance the credit agreement upon its maturity scheduled for april  as a result of the extension agreements discussed in the previous two paragraphs  the million commitment under the credit agreement is scheduled to mature as follows in millions maturity date commitment remaining commitment april  april  april  total in january  we registered on form s registration no 
 shares of common stock for issuance in connection with our acquisition program the acquisition shelf  of which  shares were available as of december  the following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year to years to years after years long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    we have total commercial commitments of million for standby letters of credit as of december  we have a million letter of credit to serve as security for our self insured workmen s compensation program 
we have a million letter of credit to serve as a guarantee for performance under a contract with the new york state workers compensation board 
we have a letter of credit for million to serve as a guarantee for periodic principal and interest payments related to debt 
finally  we have a million letter of credit to serve as security for an appeal bond related to a legal matter 
we expect to pay approximately million to million in interest in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the related consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that  as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes to our financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we apply a consistent methodology at the end of each quarter to determine our account balances that require judgmental analysis 
revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue as it becomes realized or realizable and earned according to the criteria provided by staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue recognition occurs once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or otherwise determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue earnings activities possess both project and recurring customer relationships 
project revenue includes one time projects in which the customer relationship is not expected to continue after project completion 
project revenue is typically based on time and material arrangements 
revenue recognition occurs at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
project revenue represents approximately of total revenues and typically occurs within our healthcare  regulatory  and legal compliance segment 
recurring revenue is characterized by customer relationships that are generally for one year and may continue for longer 
recurring revenue is typically based on the transaction volumes provided by our customer at an agreed upon fixed rate per unit 
our customer s volumes are typically not contractual or otherwise guaranteed 
revenue recognition occurs once work is completed and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
recurring revenue represents the remaining of total revenues and typically occurs within our information management and distribution segment 
as a part of providing services to our customers  we incur incidental expenses commonly referred to as out of pocket expenses 
these expenses include items such as airfare  hotels  and mileage and are often reimbursable by our customers 
when reimbursable  we record both revenue and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
unearned income  included in other current liabilities  represents payments from our customers in advance of services being provided 
advanced payments are deferred as unearned income when received and recognized as revenue as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established and maintained based on our estimate of accounts receivable collectibility 
management estimates collectibility by specifically analyzing accounts receivable aging and other historical factors that affect collections 
such factors include the historical trends of write offs and recovery of previously written off accounts  the financial strength of the customer and projected economic and market conditions 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective judgments and changes in these factors may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
long lived asset impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management continually evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when events require  management performs the valuation by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets to the carrying amount of the asset being evaluated 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of assets being evaluated exceeds the expected future undiscounted cash flow 
at december   no events were evident that required valuation for potential impairment 
goodwill impairment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement states that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment test is based on fair value rather than undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets are tested at a reporting unit level rather than the individual operating unit level 
a reporting unit is either at the operating segment level or one reporting level below and could consists of several service offerings aggregated into a single reporting unit 
service offerings are aggregated when they are similar in the following areas economic characteristics  products and services  production processes  methods for distributing or delivering products  and type or class of customers 
valuation methods used in determining fair value include an analysis of the cash flows that the reporting units can be expected to generate in the future income approach and the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to similar publicly traded companies market approach 
in preparing these valuations management utilizes estimates to determine fair value of the reporting units 
these estimates include future cash flows  growth rates  capital needs  and projected earning margins among other factors 
estimates utilized in future calculations could differ from estimates used in the current period 
future years estimates that are unfavorable compared to current estimates could cause an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
therefore  an impairment charge resulting from goodwill or other intangible assets could result in a material adverse impact on our financial statements during the period incurred 
self insurance liabilities and reserves 
we are self insured for workmen s compensation liabilities and a significant portion of our employee medical costs 
we account for our self insurance programs based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have not been reported 
these loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
we limit our risk by carrying stop loss policies for significant claims incurred for both workmen s compensation liabilities and medical costs 
other loss contingencies 
we record liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
our loss contingencies consist primarily of estimates related to the probable outcome of current litigation 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
fin establishes standards for determining under what circumstances vies should be consolidated with their primary beneficiary  including those to which the usual condition for consolidation does not apply 
fin also requires disclosures about unconsolidated vies in which the company has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to vies created after january  we do not have interests in vies 
as such  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on july  and such adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
financial instruments that are within the scope of the statement  which previously were often classified as equity  must now be classified as liabilities 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise generally effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our term loans  revolving credit facility and industrial revenue bonds 
interest rates are fixed on the capitalized lease obligations 
we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million to hedge  through march   our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on million of our revolving credit facility 
the swap was designated by us as a cash flow hedge 
the interest rate swap expired on march  and was not replaced 
a basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in approximately million of additional expense in based on our expected average balance outstanding under the credit facility during
