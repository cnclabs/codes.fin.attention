the decline in our net income between years primarily reflected the following a million decline in net interest income reflecting a decline in the effective interest rate spread  a million increase in general and administrative expense due to higher costs associated with the increased number of branch locations and higher loan origination activity  and a million loss from trading securities that were sold in july and were intended to enhance net interest income and serve as a partial economic hedge against mortgage servicing rights 
those unfavorable items were partially offset by the following a million increase in net gains on sales of loans due to both a higher volume of loan sales and a higher gain per dollar of loan sold  a million improvement in loan servicing activities due primarily to a smaller addition to the valuation allowance for mortgage servicing rights  a million increase in loan and deposit related fees  a million improvement in provision for loan losses  and a million litigation award

navigation links critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant estimates and assumptions  which are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our financial statements allowance for mortgage servicing rights msrs losses 
msrs are reviewed for impairment based on their fair value 
the fair value of the msrs  for the purposes of impairment  is measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on available market quotes  market adjusted discount rates and anticipated prepayment speeds 
market sources are used to determine prepayment speeds  the net cost of servicing per loan  inflation rate  and default and interest rates for mortgages 
we capitalize and measure msr impairment on a disaggregated basis based on the following predominant risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans fixed rate mortgage loans by loan term and coupon rate less than  basis point increments between and  and greater than  and loan term for adjustable rate mortgages 
impairment losses are recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum  with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing income loss 
at december   the allowance totaled million  compared to the prior year end allowance of million 
for further information  see note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of expected interest rate lock commitments 
we enter into commitments to make loans that we intend to sell to investors whereby the interest rate on the loan is set prior to funding 
these interest rate lock commitments are considered to be derivatives and are recorded at fair value 
this value is calculated using market sources  adjusted by an anticipated fallout factor for interest rate lock commitments that are not expected to fund 
at december   an asset was recorded for interest rate lock derivatives of million  compared to the prior year end asset balance of million 
for further information  see interest rate lock derivatives on page and note on page and note on page of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for losses on loans and real estate 
the allowance for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses 
we have implemented and use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to specific large loans loans over million  we evaluate the allowance on an individual loan basis  including an analysis of the creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status of the borrower  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
generally  we review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and composition of their collateral as a whole because of the relatively homogeneous nature of the portfolios  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
the allowance is determined by applying factors that take into consideration past loss experience and asset duration for each major asset type to the associated asset balance or loss statistics against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of the allowances 
at december   these allowances totaled million  compared to the prior year end allowances of million

navigation links results of operations net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings interest bearing liabilities 
the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities and the relative dollar amounts of these assets and liabilities principally affects net interest income 
our net interest income totaled million in  down million or from and million or lower than the decline during reflected a lower effective interest rate spread  as our average interest earning assets increased by million or to billion 
our effective interest rate spread averaged in  down from  the average for both and the decline in was due to our yield on interest earning assets declining more rapidly than our cost of funds 
the more rapid decline primarily reflected our positive interest rate gap ie  more interest earning assets reprice to market interest rates within one year than do interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the decline in our effective interest rate spread also reflected a higher proportion of lower yielding investment securities  a higher proportion of adjustable rate mortgages tied to the month moving average of annual yields on actively traded us treasury securities to a constant maturity of one year mta that currently have lower fully indexed yields than those tied to the fhlb eleventh district cost of funds index cofi and a lower percentage of higher yielding subprime loans 
the following table presents for the years indicated the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities and the resultant costs  expressed as rates 
the table also sets forth our net interest income  interest rate spread and effective interest rate spread 
the effective interest rate spread reflects the relative level of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and equals the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  divided by average interest earning assets for the year 
the table also sets forth our net interest earning balance the difference between the average balance of interest earning assets and the average balance of total deposits and borrowings for the years indicated

when a loan we service for others prepays  most of our loan servicing agreements require us to pay interest to the investor up to the date we remit funds to them 
that additional interest cost is what we call payoff and curtailment interest cost 
however  we benefit from the use of those proceeds from the time of repayment until we are required to remit the funds to the investor

page 
navigation links asset liability management and market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk in our lending and deposit taking activities 
this interest rate risk primarily occurs to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature on a different basis generally more rapidly than our interest earning assets 
since our earnings depend primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest and dividends earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  our principal objectives are to actively monitor and manage the effects of adverse changes in interest rates on net interest income while maintaining asset quality 
our primary strategy to manage interest rate risk is to emphasize the origination of adjustable rate mortgages or loans with relatively short maturities 
interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages are primarily tied to cofi  mta  libor and cmt 
in addition to the interest rate risk associated with our lending and deposit taking activities  we also have market risk associated with our secondary marketing activities 
changes in mortgage interest rates  primarily fixed rate mortgages  impact the fair value of loans held for sale as well as our interest rate lock commitment derivatives  where we have committed to an interest rate with a potential borrower for a loan we intend to sell 
our objective is to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates through use of forward sale and purchase contracts with government sponsored enterprises and whole loan sale contracts with various parties 
these contracts are typically obtained at the time the interest rate lock commitments are made 
therefore  as interest rates fluctuate  the changes in the fair value of our interest rate lock commitments and loans held for sale tend to be offset by changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts 
the method used for assessing the effectiveness of a hedging derivative  as well as the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspects of the hedge  is established at the inception of the hedge 
although we continue to hedge as previously done  sfas  as applied to our risk management strategies  may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity  depending on levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items  but will have no effect on the overall economics of the transactions 
we generally do not enter into hedging contracts for speculative purposes 
changes in mortgage interest rates also impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights 
rising interest rates typically result in slower prepayment speeds on the loans being serviced for others which increase the value of mortgage servicing rights 
declining interest rates typically result in faster prepayment speeds which decrease the value of mortgage servicing rights 
generally  we have not hedged our mortgage servicing rights 
however  in light of the federal reserve s change in bias towards weakness and the potential for further declines in market interest rates  we purchased during the second quarter of year us treasury securities as a partial economic hedge against the value of our mortgage servicing rights 
these securities were classified in a trading account and were carried at fair value  with any changes in fair value reflected in earnings 
this partial economic hedge was closed in july of as interest rates began to rise 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for implementing the interest rate risk management policy which sets forth limits established by the board of directors of acceptable changes in net interest income and net portfolio value from specified changes in interest rates 
the ots defines net portfolio value as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
our asset liability management committee reviews  among other items  economic conditions  the interest rate outlook  the demand for loans  the availability of deposits and borrowings  and our current operating results  liquidity  capital and interest rate exposure 
in addition  our asset liability management committee monitors asset and liability maturities and repricing characteristics on a regular basis and performs various simulations and other analyses to determine the potential impact of various business strategies in controlling interest rate risk and the potential impact of those strategies upon future earnings under various interest rate scenarios 
based on these reviews  our asset liability management committee formulates a strategy that is intended to implement the objectives set forth in our business plan without exceeding the net interest income and net portfolio value limits set forth in our interest rate risk policy

navigation links one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the following table which sets forth the repricing frequency of our major asset and liability categories as of december   as well as other information regarding the repricing and maturity differences between our interest earning assets and total deposits and borrowings in future periods 
we refer to these differences as gap 
we have determined the repricing frequencies by reference to projected maturities  based upon contractual maturities as adjusted for scheduled repayments and repricing mechanisms provisions for changes in the interest and dividend rates of assets and liabilities 
we assume prepayment rates on substantially all of our loan portfolio based upon our historical loan prepayment experience and anticipated future prepayments 
repricing mechanisms on a number of our assets are subject to limitations  such as caps on the amount that interest rates and payments on our loans may adjust  and accordingly  these assets do not normally respond to changes in market interest rates as completely or rapidly as our liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if we used different assumptions or if actual experience differed from the assumptions set forth

this means that more interest earning assets mature or reprice within six months than total deposits and borrowings 
this compares to a positive six month gap of at december  and at december  we originated and purchased for investment approximately billion during  billion during and billion during of loans and mortgage backed securities with adjustable interest rates or maturities of five years or less 
these loans represented approximately during  and of all loans and mortgage backed securities originated and purchased for investment during these periods

we primarily originate fixed rate loans for sale in the secondary market and price them accordingly to create loan servicing income and to increase opportunities for originating adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we may originate fixed rate loans for investment when funded with long term funds to mitigate interest rate risk and small volumes to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure or that meet required yield and other approved guidelines 
for further information  see secondary marketing and loan servicing activities on page we are better protected against rising interest rates with a positive six month gap 
however  we remain subject to possible interest rate spread compression  which would adversely impact our net interest income if interest rates rise 
this is primarily due to the lag in repricing of the indices to which our adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities are tied  as well as the repricing frequencies and periodic interest rate caps on these adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities 
the amount of such interest rate spread compression would depend upon the frequency and severity of such interest rate fluctuations 
in addition to measuring interest rate risk via a gap analysis  we establish limits on  and measure the sensitivity of  our net interest income and net portfolio value to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous and sustained movements in interest rates in basis point increments 
we utilize an internally maintained asset liability management simulation model to make the calculations which  for net portfolio value  are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
first  we estimate our net interest income for the next twelve months and the current net portfolio value assuming no change in interest rates from those at period end 
once the base case has been estimated  we make calculations for each of the defined changes in interest rates  to include any associated differences in the anticipated prepayment speed of loans 
we then compare those results against the base case to determine the estimated change to net interest income and net portfolio value due to the changes in interest rates 
the following are the estimated impacts to net interest income and net portfolio value from various instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rates based upon our asset and liability structure as of year ends and since we base these estimates upon numerous assumptions  like the expected maturities of our interest bearing assets and liabilities and the shape of the period end interest rate yield curve  our actual sensitivity to interest rate changes could vary significantly if actual experience differs from those assumptions used in making the calculations

rather  it only reflects contractual maturities adjusted for anticipated prepayments 
market risk sensitive instruments are generally defined as on and off balance sheet derivatives and other financial instruments 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as certain deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we do not consider these financial instruments to be materially sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  and historically  the balances have remained fairly constant over various economic conditions 
the weighted average interest rates for the various fixed rate and variable rate assets and liabilities presented are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the fair value of our financial instruments is determined as follows fed funds and fhlb stock equal their book values due to their short term repricing characteristics 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities are based on the closing market price quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for sale are based on bid quotations from financial market monitoring firms 
loans held for investment takes into consideration discounted cash flows through the estimated maturity or repricing dates using estimated market discount rates 
demand deposits  money market and savings accounts are equal to their book values 
time deposits and borrowings are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using wholesale borrowing rates offered for similar terms 
junior subordinated debentures are based upon the closing stock price of the associated capital securities published in financial information services or newspapers and may be called at our option beginning in july of the degree of market risk inherent in loans with prepayment features may not be completely reflected in the disclosures 
although we have taken into consideration our historical prepayment trends adjusted for current market conditions to determine expected maturity categories  prepayment features are triggered by changes in the market rates of interest 
unexpected changes may increase the rate of prepayments above those anticipated

it is our policy to take appropriate  timely and aggressive action when necessary to resolve non performing assets 
when resolving problem loans  it is our policy to determine collectibility under various circumstances which are intended to result in our maximum financial benefit 
we accomplish this by either working with the borrower to bring the loan current or by foreclosing and selling the asset 
we perform ongoing reviews of loans that display weaknesses and maintain adequate loss allowances on the loans 
for a discussion on our internal asset review policy  refer to allowance for losses on loans and real estate on page at december   million of our non performing assets were located outside of california  compared to million outside of california a year ago 
we evaluate the need for appraisals of non performing assets on a periodic basis 
we will generally obtain a new appraisal when we believe that there may have been an adverse change in the property operations or in the economic conditions of the geographic market of the property securing our loans 
our policy is to obtain new appraisals at least annually for all real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
non accrual loans it is our general policy to account for a loan as non accrual when the loan becomes days delinquent or when collection of interest appears doubtful 
in a number of cases  loans may remain on accrual status past days when we determine that continued accrual is warranted because the loan is well secured and in process of collection 
as of december   we had no loans days or more delinquent which remained on accrual status 
we reverse and charge against interest income any interest previously accrued with respect to non accrual loans 
we recognize interest income on non accrual loans to the extent that we receive payments and to the extent that we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we restore these loans to an accrual status only if all past due payments are made by the borrower and the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest 
at december   non accrual loans aggregating million were less than days delinquent relative to their contractual terms 
troubled debt restructurings we consider a restructuring of a debt a troubled debt restructuring when we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant 
troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms  reducing the stated interest rate or reducing the amounts of principal and or interest due or extending the maturity date 
the restructuring of a loan is intended to recover as much of our investment as possible and to achieve the highest yield possible

navigation links delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan and does not cure the delinquency within days  we normally record a notice of default to commence foreclosure proceedings  so long as we have given any required prior notice to the borrower 
if the loan is not reinstated within the time permitted by law for reinstatement  which is normally five business days prior to the date set for the non judicial trustee s sale  we may then sell the property at a foreclosure sale 
in general  if we have elected to pursue a non judicial foreclosure  we are not permitted under applicable law to obtain a deficiency judgment against the borrower  even if the security property is insufficient to cover the balance owed

as a percentage of its loan category  residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end  while subprime residential one to four units decreased from at year end to at year end a higher incidence of delinquency is expected on subprime loans as these borrowers have a history of delinquencies for which we charge higher interest rates to compensate for that risk 
in addition  the loan to value ratio on these loans is generally lower thereby providing more equity protection against loss

navigation links allowance for losses on loans and real estate we maintain a valuation allowance for losses on loans and real estate to provide for losses inherent in those portfolios 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance quarterly to maintain the allowance at levels sufficient to provide for inherent losses 
a key component to our evaluation is our internal asset review process 
our internal asset review department conducts independent reviews to evaluate the risk and quality of all our assets 
our internal asset review committee is responsible for the review and classification of assets 
the internal asset review committee members include the chief internal asset review officer  president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief administrative officer  chief lending officer  general counsel and director of compliance risk management 
the internal asset review committee meets quarterly to review and to determine asset classifications and to recommend any changes to asset valuation allowances 
with the exception of payoffs or asset sales  the classification of an asset  once established  can be removed or upgraded only upon approval of the internal asset review committee or the chief internal asset review officer as delegated by the committee 
the chief internal asset review officer reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board of directors regarding overall asset quality  the adequacy of valuation allowances on classified assets and our adherence to policies and procedures regarding asset classification and valuation 
we use an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate general valuation allowances to cover asset losses 
our current asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
we use the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk for determining the valuation allowance at a point in time 
we currently use a six grade system to classify our assets 
the current grades are pass  watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
we consider substandard  doubtful and loss assets classified assets for regulatory purposes 
a brief description of these classifications follows the pass classification represents a level of credit quality which contains no well defined deficiency or weakness 
the watch classification identifies an asset that currently contains no well defined deficiency or weakness  but warrants close monitoring eg  loans to facilitate the sale of real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this category may also be used for assets upgraded from lower classifications where continuing monitoring is deemed appropriate 
a special mention asset does not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant an adverse classification  but does possess a correctable deficiency or potential weakness deserving management s close attention 
substandard assets have a well defined weakness or weaknesses 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
an asset classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values 
we consider doubtful to be a temporary classification until resolution of pending weakness issues enables us to more clearly define the potential for loss 
page 
navigation links that portion of an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of so little value that its continuance as an asset  without establishment of a specific valuation allowance  is not warranted 
a loss classification does not mean that an asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value  but rather it is not reasonable to defer writing off or providing for all or a portion of the asset even though partial recovery may occur 
we will generally classify as loss the balance of the asset that is greater than the net fair value of the asset unless we can expect payment from another source 
therefore  the amount of an asset classified as loss reflects the total of specific valuation allowances established for the particular asset 
specific valuation allowances are not includable in determining the bank s total regulatory capital 
the ots has the authority to require us to change our asset classifications 
if the change results in an asset being classified in whole or in part as loss  a specific allowance must be established against the amount so classified or that amount must be charged off 
ots guidelines set forth quantitative benchmarks as a starting point for the determination of appropriate levels of general valuation allowances 
the ots directs its examiners to rely on management s estimates of adequate general valuation allowances if the bank s process for determining adequate allowances is deemed to be sound 
the allowances for losses on loans and real estate are maintained at an amount management deems adequate to cover inherent losses 
we have implemented and use an internal asset review system and loan loss allowance methodology designed to provide for the detection of problem assets and an adequate allowance to cover loan losses 
in determining the allowance for loan losses related to specific large loans loans over million  we evaluate the allowance on an individual loan basis  including an analysis of the creditworthiness  cash flows and financial status of the borrower  and the condition and the estimated value of the collateral 
generally  we review all loans under million by analyzing their performance and composition of their collateral as a whole because of the relatively homogeneous nature of the portfolios  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
given the above evaluations  the amount of the allowance is based upon the total of general valuation allowances  allocated allowances and an unallocated allowance 
we utilize the asset classifications from our internal asset review process in the following manner to determine the amount of our allowances general valuation allowances this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie  assets classified pass or watch and takes into consideration loss that is imbedded within the portfolio but has not yet been realized 
generally  we believe that borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans  or loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loans 
we determine general valuation allowances by applying factors that take into consideration past loss experience and asset duration for each major asset type to the associated asset balance 
allocated allowances this element relates to assets with well defined deficiencies or weaknesses ie  assets classified special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
we calculate losses on an ongoing basis by credit classification for each major asset type 
factors based upon those loss statistics are applied against current classified asset balances to determine the amount of allocated allowances 
included in these allowances are those amounts associated with assets where it is probable that the value of the asset has been impaired and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine our carrying value of the asset exceeds the net fair value and no alternative payment source exists  then we record a specific allowance for the amount of that difference 
unallocated allowance this element is more subjective and is reviewed quarterly to take into consideration estimation errors and economic trends that are not necessarily captured in determining the general valuation and allocated allowances

impaired loans we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we carry impaired loans at either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the loan s observable market price or the net fair value of the collateral securing the loan 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment 
generally  loans we collectively review for impairment include all single family loans and performing multi family and non residential loans having principal balances of less than million  unless an individual loan or borrower relationship warrants separate analysis 
in determining impairment  we consider large non homogeneous loans with the following characteristics non accrual loans  debt restructurings and performing loans which exhibit  among other characteristics  high loan to value ratios or delinquent taxes 
we base the measurement of collateral dependent impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral 
we value non collateral dependent loans based on a present value calculation of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective rate 
we generally use cash receipts on impaired loans not performing according to contractual terms to reduce the carrying value of the loan  unless we believe we will recover the remaining principal balance of the loan 
we include impairment losses in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to provision for loan losses 
we include adjustments to impairment losses due to changes in the fair value of the collateral of impaired loans in provision for loan losses 
upon disposition of an impaired loan  we record loss of principal through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the recorded investment in loans for which we have recognized impairment totaled million  down page

in addition to losses charged against the allowance for loan losses  we have maintained a valuation allowance for losses on real estate and joint ventures held for investment 
the provision in is related to one property under construction 
the provision reductions in the previous two years were  in general  due to a continuing improvement in the real estate market which favorably impacted the valuation of certain neighborhood shopping center investments and to a reduction in the investment in certain joint venture investments 
the following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for real estate and joint ventures held for investment during the years indicated

capital resources and liquidity our sources of funds include deposits  advances from the fhlb and other borrowings  proceeds from the sale of loans  mortgage backed securities and real estate  payments from loans and mortgage backed securities and sales of loan servicing  and income from other investments 
interest rates  real estate sales activity and general economic conditions significantly affect repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and deposit inflows and outflows

our principal source of liquidity is our ability to utilize borrowings  as needed 
our primary source of borrowings is the fhlb 
at december   our fhlb borrowings totaled billion  representing of total assets 
we currently are approved by the fhlb to borrow up to of total assets to the extent we provide qualifying collateral and hold sufficient fhlb stock 
that approved limit would have permitted us  as of year end  to borrow an additional billion 
to the extent deposit growth falls short of satisfying ongoing commitments to fund maturing and withdrawable deposits  repay maturing borrowings  fund existing and future loans  make investments  and continue branch improvement programs  we may utilize our fhlb borrowing arrangement or other sources

stockholders equity totaled million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  contractual obligations and other commitments through the normal course of operations  we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
our obligations generally relate to funding of our operations through deposits and borrowings as well as leases for premises and equipment  and our commitments generally relate to our lending operations 
we have obligations under long term operating leases  principally for building space and land 
lease terms generally cover a five year period  with options to extend  and are non cancelable 
currently  we have no significant vendor contractual obligations 
our commitments to originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment 
undisbursed loan funds and unused lines of credit include funds not disbursed  but committed to construction projects and home equity and commercial lines of credit 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since some commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing lines and letters of credit requires the same creditworthiness evaluation as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we evaluate each customer s creditworthiness 
we receive collateral to support commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary

for further information regarding our derivative instruments  see asset liability management and market risk on page and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements on page we sell all loans without recourse 
when a loan sold to an investor without recourse fails to perform according to the contractual terms  the investor will typically review the loan file to determine whether defects in the origination process occurred and whether such defects give rise to a violation of a representation or warranty made to the investor in connection with the sale 
if such a defect is identified  we may be required to either repurchase the loan or indemnify the investor for losses sustained 
if there are no such defects  we have no commitment to repurchase the loan 
there were no repurchases or indemnification losses related to such defects in and there were million of loans repurchased and million of indemnification losses in these sale contracts may also contain provisions to refund purchase price premiums to the investor if the loans prepay during a period not to exceed days from the sale s date

financial accounting standards board interpretation financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
prior to fin r  a company included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin r also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidated requirements of fin r apply to all special purpose entities spes by the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  the provisions of fin r for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities that are not spes are required to be applied by the first reporting period that ends after march  we have no business interests that require consolidation as a result of applying the provisions of fin r

for the purpose of issuing capital securities  was previously reported on a consolidated basis  with the capital securities issued by the trust shown on the balance sheet consistent with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   in accordance with fin r revised december  the trust is no longer reported on a consolidated basis 
therefore  the capital securities of million no longer appear on the balance sheet 
instead  the junior subordinated debentures of million payable by downey financial corp 
to the trust and the investment in the trust s common stock of million are separately reported

current accounting issues interest rate lock derivatives in accordance with sfas  expected interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivatives and marked to market in accordance with sfas all other interest rate lock commitments are excluded from sfas  pursuant to sfas in october  the fasb decided to add a project to its agenda that would clarify how fair value should be measured for interest rate lock derivatives 
the fasb will determine if it is appropriate to recognize an asset component when measuring the value of the interest rate lock derivative 
no timetable has been established yet for the completion of this project 
in the meantime  in a speech given by a securities and exchange commission sec staff member in december  it was expressed that the sec staff s view for valuing interest rate lock derivatives is that they are written options in which a liability should be recognized initially  with the offsetting debit to the extent that consideration is not received recorded as sfas losses in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities 
subsequent to initial measurement  the commitments would be valued like other written options 
that is  the amount would always be reported as a liability until expiration or termination of the commitment 
the speech directed compliance with this accounting policy guidance by the first reporting period beginning after march  currently  we do not recognize an asset on the initial day of an interest rate lock derivative  but we do recognize an asset component when market interest rates drop below the committed interest rate 
if generally accepted accounting principles are changed to reflect the sec s views  the timing of the gain recognition inherent within our interest rate lock derivatives would be delayed until the anticipated loans are sold 
generally  loans held page 
navigation links for sale are sold within to days after the initial recognition of the interest rate lock derivative 
the provisions for the sec s accounting policy guidance are to be applied prospectively 
at december   we had assets recorded for interest rate lock derivatives of million and capitalized basis adjustment to loans held for sale of million  which reflects the change in fair value of the interest rate lock derivative from the date of commitment to the date of funding 
at december   assets were recorded for interest rate lock derivatives of million and capitalized basis adjustment to loans held for sale of million 
the offsetting credit to these assets was recorded as sfas gains in net gains on sales of loans and mortgage backed securities
