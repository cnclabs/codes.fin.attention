item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview america s car mart  inc  a texas corporation the company  is the largest publicly held automotive retailer in the united states focused exclusively on the buy here pay here segment of the used car market 
references to the company typically include the company s consolidated subsidiaries 
the company s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries  america s car mart  inc  an arkansas corporation  car mart of arkansas and colonial auto finance  inc colonial 
collectively  car mart of arkansas and colonial are referred to herein as car mart 
the company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers 
many of the company s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems 
as of april   the company operated stores located primarily in small cities throughout the south central united states 
in october  the company made the decision to sell all of its operating subsidiaries except car mart  and relocate its corporate headquarters to bentonville  arkansas where car mart is based 
as a result of this decision  all of the company s other operating subsidiaries were sold and their operating results have been included in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations are described in note p in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
car mart has been operating since car mart has grown its revenues at a compound annual rate of over the last eight years 
finance receivables tend to grow at about the same rate as revenues 
growth results from same store revenue growth and the addition of new stores 
revenue growth in fiscal was lower than the company s historical average partially as a result of selling more lower priced vehicles and a slower pace of opening new stores 
the company expects revenues to increase about in fiscal the company s primary focus is on collections 
each store handles its own collections with supervisory involvement of the corporate office 
over the last nine years car mart s credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged between approximately and 
credit losses in fiscal were on the high end of the range partially as a result of selling more lower priced vehicles 
lower priced vehicles tend to have more mechanical difficulties that result in a higher level of repossessions 
late in fiscal the company substantially reduced the sale of lower priced vehicles 
the company expects credit losses  as a percentage of sales  to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s gross margins as a percentage of sales have been fairly consistent from year to year 
over the last nine years car mart s gross margins as a percentage of sales have ranged between approximately and 
gross margins as a percentage of sales in fiscal were on the high end of the range partially as a result of selling more lower priced vehicles 
the company s gross margins are set based upon the cost of the vehicle purchased with lower priced vehicles having higher gross margin percentages 
as a result of the company s decision late in fiscal to substantially reduce the sale of lower priced vehicles  the company expects gross margins  as a percentage of sales  to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal hiring  training  and retaining qualified associates are a continuing focus for the company 
the rate at which the company adds new stores is oftentimes limited by the number of trained managers the company has at its disposal 
in fiscal  the company intends to add resources to increase its ability to train new store managers and corporate office management personnel

operating data retail units sold    average stores in operation average units sold per store 
average retail sales price    same store revenue growth receivables avg interest rate compared to revenues increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of i revenue growth from stores that operated a full twelve months in both periods million  or  ii revenue growth from stores opened during fiscal or stores that opened or closed a satellite location during fiscal or fiscal million  and iii revenues from stores opened during fiscal million 
same store revenue growth slowed to in fiscal from in fiscal principally as a result of a smaller increase in the average retail sales price in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and more conservative underwriting practices beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal the slowing of growth in the average retail sales price stems from a decision at the beginning of fiscal to sell a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles 
although lower priced vehicles have higher gross margin percentages  and are more affordable than higher priced vehicles  selling lower priced vehicles has a negative impact on revenue growth  and  as discussed below  loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
as a result of the negative impact on revenue growth and the higher charge off experience  during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
revenue growth slowed to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal principally as a result of i the lower same store revenue growth discussed above  ii fewer new lot openings in fiscal seven new lots opened  one satellite lot closed as compared to fiscal nine new lots opened  and iii the timing of new lot openings in fiscal as compared to fiscal lot openings in fiscal occurred later in the year as compared to fiscal 
presently  the company plans to open eight new stores in fiscal cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i selling a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles during the first nine months of fiscal lower priced vehicles have higher gross margin percentages than higher priced vehicles  ii the company s decision in late december to raise prices by about  or  on most of the vehicles it sells  and iii encouraging store managers to more closely adhere to the company s pricing matrix and not to use their discretionary authority to discount the sales price of vehicles 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i lower compensation expense at its irving  texas office in connection with the relocation of the company s principal headquarters from irving  texas to bentonville  arkansas during fiscal  and ii lower compensation expense in connection with a change in the senior management bonus program  partially offset by higher insurance and advertising costs 
provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher charge offs as a percentage of sales and an increase of the company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivable principal balances 
as discussed above  the company believes the increase in charge offs was partially attributable to a decision at the beginning of fiscal to sell a higher percentage of lower priced vehicles 
lower priced vehicles have higher margins on a percentage basis and are more affordable to the company s customers 
however  historical data indicates that loans on lower priced vehicles have higher charge off experience than loans on higher priced vehicles 
as a result of the negative impact on revenue growth as discussed above and higher than normal charge off experience  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company decided to substantially reduce its purchase and sale of lower priced vehicles and began purchasing and selling slightly higher priced vehicles 
in february the company formally adopted additional delinquency standards for its larger stores 
the additional delinquency standards prescribe the percentage of accounts at larger stores that can be days past due  days past due and over days past due 
previously  the company only had delinquency standards for accounts one and two weeks past due and three or more weeks past due 
as a result of the tightening of its delinquency standards  at april  the percentage of accounts over days past due had been reduced to  from at april  the company believes that in the long run the adoption of the additional delinquency standards will assist the company in reducing charge offs  as well as maintaining the percentage of accounts over days past due at historically lower levels 
with the additional delinquency standards  store managers and collection personnel are motivated monthly store team bonuses are tied to meeting delinquency and repossession standards to address severely past due accounts on a more timely basis  which management believes will result in more accounts being saved  rather than charged off 
as a result of the higher charge offs discussed above  the company determined it was necessary to increase its overall allowance for credit losses 
during fiscal  the company increased its allowance for credit losses by basis points  from of finance receivable principal balances at april   to of finance receivable principal balances at april  interest expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 
in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i a decrease in the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility the rate was reduced by basis points in november  and ii a lower level of borrowings relative to the sales volume of the company 
compared to revenues increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of i revenue growth from stores that operated a full twelve months in both periods million  or  ii revenue growth from stores opened during fiscal or stores that added a satellite location during fiscal or fiscal million  and iii revenues from stores opened during fiscal million  partially offset by a decrease in other interest income 
million 
interest income as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of a decrease in the maximum interest rate that can be charged on arkansas originated loans 
interest charged on arkansas originated loans is limited to the federal primary credit rate plus 
as of april   approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales was in both fiscal and fiscal selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase was principally the result of i changing the staffing policy at the store level in the middle of fiscal such that more personnel are employed at the same number of active customer accounts store staffing levels are based upon the number of active customer accounts  ii creating several new positions at the corporate office in the middle of fiscal to assist in managing the company s growing business  and iii higher insurance costs  partially offset by a reduction in compensation and office expenses at its irving  texas office in connection with the relocation of the company s principal headquarters from irving  texas to bentonville  arkansas during fiscal provision for credit losses as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i increased staffing at the store and corporate office levels  and ii improvements in the company s underwriting and collection practices 
interest expense as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was principally the result of i a decrease in the prime interest rate interest charged on the company s revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime interest rate  and ii a lower level of borrowings relative to the sales volume of the company 
during fiscal the company recorded a million non cash charge related to stock option based compensation 
the charge pertains to the company s stock option plan which contained a cashless exercise feature 
due to such cashless exercise feature  options granted under the plan were characterized as variable options under generally accepted accounting principles 
under variable option accounting  changes in the market value of the company s common stock generally result in charges or credits to stock based compensation with an offsetting entry to additional paid in capital 
in order to avoid future stock option based compensation charges or credits  effective may  the company rescinded the cashless exercise provision of its plan 
also during fiscal  the company recorded a million restructuring charge severance and office closing costs in connection with the decision to relocate its corporate headquarters from irving  texas to bentonville  arkansas 
further  during fiscal  the company wrote down the carrying value of two emerging technology internet investments and certain equipment by million that were deemed to be impaired 
the emerging technology internet investments were made a few years prior to the company s decision in october to focus exclusively on the business of car mart 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain historical information with respect to the company s statements of cash flows in thousands years ended april  operating activities income loss from continuing operations    finance receivables  net    stock option based compensation  other   total   investing activities purchase of property and equipment and other   note collections from discontinued operations   sale of discontinued operations  purchase of minority interest  total    financing activities revolving credit facility  net    repayment of other debt  purchase of common stock    exercise of stock options and warrants   total    cash provided by used in continuing operations the company generates cash flow from income from continuing operations 
most or all of this cash is used to fund finance receivables growth 
to the extent finance receivables growth exceeds income from continuing operations  generally the company increases its borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
for the most part  the company s growth is self funded 
at april  the company had million of cash on hand and an additional million of availability under its million revolving credit facility 
on a short term basis  the company s principal sources of liquidity include income from continuing operations and borrowings from its revolving credit facility 
on a longer term basis  the company expects its principal sources of liquidity to consist of income from continuing operations and borrowings from a revolving credit facility 
further  while the company has no present plans to issue debt or equity securities  the company believes  if necessary  it could raise additional capital through the issuance of such securities 
the company expects to use cash to i grow its finance receivables portfolio by approximately the same percentage that its sales grow  ii purchase property and equipment of approximately million in the next twelve months in connection with opening new stores and refurbishing existing stores  and iii to the extent excess cash is available  reduce debt 
in addition  from time to time the company may use cash to repurchase its common stock 
the company s revolving credit facility matures in april the company expects that it will be able to renew or refinance its revolving credit facility on or before the scheduled maturity date 
the company believes it will have adequate liquidity to satisfy its capital needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual payment obligations the following is a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of april  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt   operating leases   total    impact of inflation inflation has not historically been a significant factor impacting the company s results 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into operating leases for approximately of its store and office facilities 
generally these leases are for periods of three to five years and usually contain multiple renewal options 
the company expects to continue to lease the majority of its store and office facilities under arrangements substantially consistent with the past 
other than its operating leases  the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from the company s estimates 
the company believes the most significant estimate made in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the determination of its allowance for credit losses  which is discussed below 
the company s accounting policies are discussed in note b in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at a level it considers sufficient to cover anticipated losses in the collection of its finance receivables 
the allowance for credit losses is based primarily upon historical credit loss experience  with consideration given to recent credit loss trends and changes in loan characteristics ie  average amount financed and term  delinquency levels  collateral values  economic conditions  underwriting and collection practices  and management s expectations of future credit losses 
judgment is necessary to determine the proper weight to place on certain quantitative and non quantitative information such as changes in underwriting and collection practices  economic conditions and credit loss trends 
further  there is no certainty that future credit losses will resemble historical credit losses 
consequently  it is at least reasonably possible that actual credit losses could be materially different from the recorded allowance for credit losses if future conditions are materially different from the future conditions assumed by the company  or if management improperly weights current credit loss information 
seasonality the company s automobile sales and finance business is seasonal in nature 
the company s third fiscal quarter november through january is historically the slowest period for car and truck sales 
many of the company s operating expenses such as administrative personnel  rent and insurance are fixed and cannot be reduced during periods of decreased sales 
conversely  the company s fourth fiscal quarter february through april is historically the busiest time for car and truck sales as many of the company s customers use income tax refunds as a down payment on the purchase of a vehicle 
further  the company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its finance receivable credit losses 
as a percentage of sales  the company s first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to have lower credit losses averaging over the last eight years  while its second and third fiscal quarters tend to have higher credit losses averaging over the last eight years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk on its financial instruments from changes in interest rates 
in particular  the company has exposure to changes in the federal primary credit rate and the prime interest rate of its lender 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes or to manage interest rate risk 
the company s earnings are impacted by its net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on interest bearing assets and the interest paid on interest bearing notes payable 
as described below  a decrease in market interest rates would generally have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company s financial instruments consist of fixed rate finance receivables and variable rate notes payable 
the company s finance receivables generally bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to 
these finance receivables generally have remaining maturities from one to months 
the company s borrowings contain variable interest rates that fluctuate with market interest rates ie  the rate charged on the company s revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime interest rate of its lender 
however  interest rates charged on finance receivables originated in the state of arkansas are limited to the federal primary credit rate at april  plus 
typically  the company charges interest on its arkansas loans at or near the maximum rate allowed by law 
thus  while the interest rates charged on the company s loans do not fluctuate once established  new loans originated in arkansas are set at a spread above the federal primary credit rate which does fluctuate 
at april   approximately of the company s finance receivables were originated in arkansas 
assuming that this percentage is held constant for future loan originations  the long term effect of decreases in the federal primary credit rate would generally have a negative effect on the profitability of the company 
this is the case because the amount of interest income lost on arkansas originated loans would likely exceed the amount of interest expense saved on the company s variable rate borrowings assuming the prime interest rate of its lender decreases by the same percentage as the decrease in the federal primary credit rate 
the initial impact on profitability resulting from a decrease in the federal primary credit rate and the rate charged on its variable interest rate borrowings would be positive  as the immediate interest expense savings would outweigh the loss of interest income on new loan originations 
however  as the amount of new loans originated at the lower interest rate increases to an amount in excess of the amount of variable interest rate borrowings  the effect on profitability would become negative 
the table below illustrates the estimated impact that hypothetical changes in the federal primary credit rate would have on the company s continuing pretax earnings 
the calculations assume i the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate remains in effect for two years  ii the increase or decrease in the federal primary credit rate results in a like increase or decrease in the rate charged on the company s variable rate borrowings  iii the principal amount of finance receivables million and variable interest rate borrowings million  and the percentage of arkansas originated finance receivables  remain constant during the periods  and iv the company s historical collection and charge off experience continues throughout the periods 
increase decrease in interest rates year increase decrease in pretax earnings year increase decrease in pretax earnings in thousands in thousands a similar calculation and table was prepared at april  the calculation and table were materially consistent with the information provided above
