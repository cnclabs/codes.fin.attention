item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of consumable dental products and related small equipment  and a manufacturer and distributor of products for use in infection prevention in both the medical and dental markets 
prior to december   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of apogent technologies inc  which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of fisher scientific international inc on december   apogent spun off its dental business by way of a pro rata distribution to its shareholders of all of our outstanding common stock together with related preferred stock purchase rights 
as a result of the spin off  we became an independent  publicly traded company 
our two business segments are professional dental and specialty products 
in fiscal we began reporting in the specialty products segment the net sales of certain endodontic products whose sales were previously included in the net sales of the professional dental segment 
at the commencement of the fiscal year we added to the net sales of the specialty products segment the net sales of certain other endodontic products that were also previously included in the net sales reported for the professional dental segment 
we did not restate the operating results of either the professional dental segment or the specialty products segment for the periods prior to the periods in which the reporting of the net sales of the endodontic products changed 
while it would have been possible to restate the net sales for the prior periods to reflect the change  it was impracticable to restate the prior period operating results as the effect the change in net sales had on selling  general and administrative expenses could not be calculated 
the change in the recording of the endodontic products net sales from the professional dental segment to the specialty products segment did not impact the consolidated results of operations for any of the fiscal year periods reported herein 
our corporate general and administrative expenses have been allocated to the segments using the same ratio as the ratio of the segment s net sales to our total net sales 
the allocation is made without regard to the level of the benefit each segment received from the corporate expenses 
the corporate general and administrative expenses include certain legal and other expenses which may be associated with only one segment 
however  as a result of our method of allocating those expenses  a portion of the cost is reflected in both our professional dental and specialty products segments 
for example  in fiscal expenses of million associated with patent litigation involving only the specialty products segment were allocated to both the professional dental segment and specialty products segment 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item of this annual report 
overview based upon the information we have available to us  we estimate the growth of the worldwide dental market for the type of products we sell to be between and percent  with the us market growing at the upper end of the range 
the factors that we believe will allow the market to continue to grow in the to range are  among others things  a steadily growing demand by consumers for endodontic  periodontic  orthodontic  cosmetic and other specialized procedures in an effort to retain and improve the appearance of their natural teeth  the aging baby boomer segment of the population who we think are more likely to require repair and reconstructive dental procedures  such as root canals and the placement of crowns or bridges  technological advances in dental products which reduce both the discomfort to the patient and the treatment time thereby attracting more patients  
table of contents an increasing worldwide population  creating more dental patients  and an expected growth in per capita and discretionary incomes in emerging nations which should result in healthcare  including dental services  becoming a greater priority 
our worldwide net sales grew from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase 
our fiscal net sales increase is due to favorable foreign currency fluctuations of  internal growth of and acquisitions of 
both our overall net sales growth rate and our internal net sales growth rate in fiscal were less than they were in fiscal  which experienced an overall net sales growth of and internal growth rate of 
we define internal net sales as total net sales excluding foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions made in the past twelve months 
the slowness we experienced in our internal net sales growth rate was the result of the negative internal growth experienced by our professional dental segment 
our professional dental segment had negative internal growth of for the fiscal year 
if we exclude equipment sales from the calculation of our professional dental segment internal net sales  the segment experienced positive internal growth of over the prior year period  although that rate is still below the segment s historical growth rate of to 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was the greatest in the us market 
the decrease was largely due to the decrease in the sales of our led curing light  the customer purchases made at the end of fiscal of our professional dental segment products in advance of a price increase scheduled to take effect at the beginning of fiscal  the adjustments made by the largest customer of our dental burs in its inventory levels due to a configuration change in the packaging of their products which resulted in a temporary reduction in their purchases of dental burs  a decline in the demand for dental amalgam products  a reduction in the growth of our dental composite products to a single digit increase  and a delay in the launch of our new impression material  impacting the ability to grow what is a significant product line for our professional dental segment 
we expect to continue to experience a decline in the net sales of our led curing light  which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal and generated significant net sales during the fiscal year 
unlike our consumable product sales which generate consistent sales as the products cannot be reused  a curing light has a life span of to years 
as a result  the sales made of that product in fiscal were not repeated in fiscal and are expected to continue to decline 
we anticipate the sales of premise  our new dental composite  and kavitan lc  our new glass ionomer  will be additive to the sales of our other dental composites  resulting in greater growth in fiscal for that product line 
likewise  standout  our new impression material is expected to increase the sales of our impression materials 
we expect the sales of our dental burs to return to their normal levels as the packaging reconfiguration for our largest customer has been completed 
as a result of the various measures we have undertaken  we anticipate that our internal growth rate in fiscal will return to our historical levels 
in contrast to the decrease in the internal net sales growth rate of our professional dental segment  our specialty products segment had an internal growth rate in fiscal of 
the majority of the growth occurred in the us market which had an internal net sales growth of  while the internal net sales growth in all other markets grew at 
the internal net sales growth rates in fiscal were for the us market and for all other markets 
the increase in net sales is a result  in part  of an increase in demand for our damon self ligating bracket  the net sales of our inspire ice clear ceramic bracket  which was introduced in the first quarter of  the sales of our damon self ligating bracket which was introduced in the third quarter of fiscal  the increase in sales of our ni ti endodontic files  and an increase in the sales of certain of our orthodontic arch wires 
we intend to continue to focus our selling efforts on the damon self ligating bracket system and our inspire ice and titanium orthos brackets 
we believe those product lines present us with a series of differentiated products which will continue to create selling opportunities that will allow us to achieve internal sales growth in at the upper end of our historical to internal growth rate  although reductions in the payments under certain governmental health reimbursement programs  such as those in germany where reimbursement programs 
table of contents exist  could impact our selling efforts 
as we focus on our efforts on our newer products  we expect to experience a decline in our more traditional bracket product line 
operating income for fiscal was million  representing a slight increase from the corresponding fiscal period operating income of million 
as a percent of sales our operating income decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal our operating income in fiscal was negatively impacted by million incurred in the closure of ormco s production facility in tijuana  mexico and an increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses due to the costs incurred in the evaluation of prospective mergers and acquisitions  the expense of our sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts  the charges caused by our foreign currency zero cost collar hedges  and legal expenses associated with certain patent litigation relating to the specialty products business segment 
we do not expect to incur any significant charges connected to the tijuana facility closure and anticipate a reduction in the costs associated with the patent litigation in fiscal interest expense in fiscal was million or million less than the prior year period 
the decrease was a result of lower average debt in the year of million  or million less than in the prior year period  partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate to  from in the prior year period 
the increase in the average interest rate was the result of the pay down of our floating rate debt  which carried a lower interest rate than our fixed rate debt 
we expect to see a slight increase in our average interest rate in fiscal as we anticipate interest rates will continue to rise and as we continue to pay down our lower interest rate debt 
income taxes in fiscal were million or of income before taxes as compared to income taxes of million  or of income before taxes in fiscal the reduction in our tax rate is primarily attributable to the benefits resulting from the consolidation of several of our european facilities into switzerland  which has a lower tax rate 
we do not anticipate any further reduction in our tax rate  unless there is a substantial change in the geographical mix of our products  which we do not expect 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act 
should we decide to repatriate earnings of non us subsidiaries under the terms of the jobs creation act  there may be an impact on our tax rate

critical accounting estimates we believe the following critical accounting estimates  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources and are inherently uncertain 
as a result  changes in estimates  assumptions and general market conditions on which our judgments and estimates are based  could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have two non contributory defined benefit pension plans that cover all regular united states based employees with more than five years of service 
our accumulated benefit obligation  the fair value of plan assets and the amount of annual pension cost are calculated based on a number of actuarial assumptions including an expected long term return on plan assets  assumed rates of compensation increase and the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluate input from our actuaries as well as information available from the securities markets 
the assumptions and factors used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market conditions  earlier or later retirement ages or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by us 
the actuarial assumptions are evaluated annually as of the beginning of each fiscal year 
at october   the discount rate was 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the projected pension obligation is decreased or increased  accordingly 
the estimated effect of a decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected pension benefit obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 
the expected long term rate of return on the pension plan assets is the weighted average rate of the long term investment return expected on those assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  the gain would reduce future pension expense over a period of approximately to years 
as of october   we utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the estimated effect of a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would decrease the projected pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million 

table of contents the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
at october   we utilized a rate of 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pension obligation and annual pension expense 
the estimated effect of a increase in the assumed rate of compensation increase would increase the projected pension obligation by million and increase annual pension expense by million

we perform an annual review in the first quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting units revenue based on market segment growth rates and our market segment share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular segment s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  internal estimates  and external sources  all of which are developed as part of our long range planning process 
we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis by comparison to available and comparable market data 
no impairment charges for goodwill was recorded in the year ended september  long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset s carrying value is not recoverable though the related cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value  based upon the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain of our long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory 
the determination of obsolete and excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
the estimates of future demand for our products are based in part upon historical sales data and estimated future demand based on the information we currently have available to us 
if our forecasted demand for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output or sell existing inventory accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
net sales rebate accruals we have various rebate programs in each of our business segments 
each rebate program has different criteria for calculating rebate payments 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future rebate payments and establish accruals at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our accruals for rebates are estimated based on customers historical and estimated future performance against the terms and conditions of our rebate programs  which are typically on a calendar year basis 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

table of contents acquisitions as discussed in item business research and development  we have maintained an active program of development and introduction of new products 
we believe that introducing new products is important to maintain our competitive position 
we have also pursued numerous acquisition opportunities  completing acquisitions since acquisitions completed since the beginning of fiscal are as follows company acquired acquisition date acquisition type description professional dental surgical acuity  inc asset manufacturer of magnification lenses and fiber optic lighting systems used for illumination during dental procedures spofadental a 
s stock manufacturer of consumable dental supplies bioplant products  inc asset manufacturer of bone regeneration product specialty products innova lifesciences corporation stock manufacturer of dental implants and attachments these acquisitions included in our business segments are consistent with our strategy of acquiring product lines that can be manufactured in existing facilities  sold through existing sales and distribution networks or that expand our geographic reach 
we intend to continue to seek out acquisition candidates consistent with our strategy 
however  there can be no assurance of the number or size of future acquisitions 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we implemented and completed a plan to close our facility in tijuana  mexico by the end of the first quarter of fiscal  and as a result of this plan  recorded restructuring charges of million million after tax in the fiscal year ended september  the charges are comprised of severance and termination costs associated with the employees whose employment we terminated as a result of the closure and recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the fiscal year

in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million million after tax 
the charge is primarily comprised of severance and termination costs associated with the employees whose employment we terminated as a result of the consolidation of several of our european facilities into our hawe neos facility in switzerland 
of the million restructuring charge  approximately million is related to cash payments for severance and contractual obligations  million for the cash payment of tax liabilities included in income taxes payable while the balance of approximately million relates to non cash charges

international operations a substantial portion of our sales  income and cash flows is derived internationally 
the financial position and the results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  are measured using the local currency of the countries in which such operations are conducted and are then translated into us dollars 
while the reported income of foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency  the effects of foreign currency 
table of contents fluctuations are mitigated by the fact that our subsidiaries operations are conducted in numerous foreign countries and  therefore  in numerous foreign currencies 
in addition  our us export sales may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar  as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases upward or downward according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
from time to time we employ currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we have hedged our foreign currency exposure to protect against currency fluctuations in fiscal by securing monthly zero cost collar contracts with a notional amount of approximately million for the euro  a notional amount of approximately million for the japanese yen  and a notional amount of approximately million for the australian dollar 
a total currency loss in the amount of million was recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended september   while a currency loss of million net of income tax  representing the fair value of the zero cost collars  was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
additionally  in june  we entered into cross currency debt swap transactions to hedge our net investment in hawe neos and sybron dental specialties japan 
the agreements were contracts to exchange a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a swiss franc principal amount of million at the termination date of june  and a us dollar principal amount of million in exchange for a japanese yen principal amount of million at the termination date of june  for fiscal year  the fair value of the cross currency debt swap transaction loss net of income tax included in the cumulative translation adjustments was million 
for additional information regarding foreign currency risk management please refer to item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we expect to continue to employ measures to protect our earnings from currency volatility through the use of currency options  forward contracts or similar instruments beyond fiscal year the following table sets forth our domestic sales and sales outside the united states in  and see also note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
year ended september  in thousands domestic net sales international net sales total net sales inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on net sales or income during any of the periods presented above 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
liquidity and capital resources general we intend to fund our working capital requirements primarily related to inventory and accounts receivable  capital expenditure requirements primarily related to the purchase of machinery equipment  acquisitions  principal and interest payments on our credit facility defined below  obligations under the sale leaseback defined below  restructuring expenditures  other liabilities and periodic expansion of facilities  to the extent available  with funds provided by operations and short term borrowings under the revolver defined below 
while cash provided from operating activities may be impacted by a variety of factors  such as lower revenues  an increase in expenses  and the continued risk of a competitive market and changes in demand for our 
table of contents products  we believe that our cash flow from operations  unused amounts available under our revolver defined below and access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital investment  acquisition and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that will be the case 
to the extent that funds are not available from these sources  we would have to raise additional capital in another manner 
as of september   million of the million revolving credit facility was available for borrowing 
it is currently our intent to reduce total debt and to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy when those acquisitions appear to be in the best interest of the stockholders  taking into account our level of debt and interest expense 
if significant acquisition opportunities become available  of which there can be no assurance  we may require financing beyond the capacity of our credit facility defined below 
in addition  certain acquisitions previously completed contain earnout provisions requiring further payments in the future if certain financial results are achieved by the acquired companies 
as of september   we had million in cash on hand  of which  million normally would have been used to reduce debt 
rather than pay down term debt  which cannot be drawn upon once paid down  we held the cash to use toward the purchase of the common shares of innova lifesciences corporation  which was made in october the statements contained in the immediately preceding paragraph concerning our intent to continue to pursue our acquisition strategy are forward looking statements 
our ability to continue our acquisition strategy is subject to a number of uncertainties  including  but not limited to  our ability to raise capital beyond the capacity of our credit facility and the availability of suitable acquisitions candidates at reasonable prices 
year ended september  working capital increased from million at september  to million at september  the current ratio increased from at september  to at september  the current ratio increased as a result of increases in inventory and cash 
the increase in cash was primarily at our offshore entities 
cash increased from million at september  to million at september   an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  offset by net cash used in investing activities of million and net cash used in financing activities of million 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
increases in net income and the tax benefit from stock option exercises were more than offset by increases in inventory  prepaids and the net change in the deferred tax accounts 
days sales outstanding decreased slightly  from at september   to at september  inventory increased million from september  to september   resulting in an increase in inventory days on hand to as of september  from as of september  the increase in inventory is partially due to inventory builds to support our recent and upcoming product launches 
additionally  we are building inventories in advance of the january expiration of our union contract at our michigan manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
a significant portion of the million increase from fiscal to fiscal is due to the modernization of our european manufacturing facilities 
we expect capital expenditures for all of fiscal to be approximately million  including the purchase of manufacturing facilities in wisconsin and connecticut which had been leased previously 
net cash used for financing activities for the year ended september  was million  as compared to million for the same period in fiscal net debt repayments were million  offset by cash received from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of million 
as a result of the upgrade in our credit rating by standard poor s and moody s investors service  we amended our credit facility in july and received a basis point reduction in the margin on our term loan 
table of contents and amended our covenants to allow us to utilize up to million for stock repurchases or dividend payments  at our discretion 
previously we were limited to million for these purposes 
we currently have no plans to initiate a stock repurchase program or begin paying dividends 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements and to comply with our debt covenants is dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors affecting us  many of which are beyond our control 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of september  year ended september  working capital decreased from million at september  to at september  the current ratio decreased from at september  to at september  the current ratio decreased as a result of increases in accrued payroll as well as employee benefits and income taxes payable  both of which were the result of the improved performance in fiscal as compared to fiscal during the same period cash increased from million to million  primarily due to million provided by operating activities and million of other cash inflows  offset by million of cash used for acquisitions  million of capital expenditures  and million of net debt reduction 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the primary causes of the increase in cash provided by operations were the increases in net income of million million of which was the result of ceasing goodwill amortization  income taxes payable of million and accrued payroll and employee benefits of million  as well as a decrease in inventory of million 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable increased by million from september  to september   consistent with the increase in sales from the fourth fiscal quarter of to the fourth fiscal quarter of days sales outstanding increased slightly  from at september   to at september  inventory decreased million from september  to september  as a result of our increased focus on supply chain and inventory management 
inventory days decreased to at september  from at september  credit facilities and senior subordinated notes on june   we terminated our then existing million credit facility and entered into a million syndicated credit facility for which credit suisse first boston is the administrative agent 
the credit facility the credit facility  provides for a five year million revolving credit facility the revolver  a seven year million term loan the term loan b and a five year million revolving credit facility the euro tranche 
sybron dental specialties  inc  kerr corporation  ormco corporation and pinnacle products  inc the domestic borrowers are joint and several borrowers under the revolver and the term loan b  and hawe neos holdings sa hawe neos is the borrower under the euro tranche 
sybron dental specialties became a borrower under the revolver and term loan b as a result of the merger of sybron dental management into sybron dental specialties effective january  in addition to the credit facility  we also completed on june   the sale of million of senior subordinated notes due the senior subordinated notes in a private offering 
we used the proceeds of the term loan b  together with proceeds from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  to repay all of the million of borrowings outstanding as of june  under our previous credit facility 
the credit facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by sybron dental specialties  inc  the other domestic borrowers and each of our present and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  and is secured by substantially all assets of each such entity  including the capital stock of each domestic subsidiary 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of each of our first tier material foreign subsidiaries 
the euro tranche is also guaranteed by certain foreign subsidiaries and is 
table of contents secured by a pledge of of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries and by some of the assets of our swiss subsidiary  hawe neos  certain direct subsidiaries of hawe neos and certain of our other indirect foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility may be prepaid at any time without penalty except for libor and euro libor breakage costs 
under the credit facility  subject to certain exceptions  we are required to apply all of the proceeds from any issuance of debt  half of the proceeds from any issuance of equity  half of our excess annual cash flow and  subject to permitted reinvestments  all amounts received in connection with any sale of our assets and casualty insurance and condemnation or eminent domain proceedings  in each case to repay the outstanding amounts under the facility 
the term b loan amortizes annually for the first six years  payable quarterly  with the balance to be paid in the seventh year in equal quarterly installments 
as a result of the upgrade in our credit rating by standard poor s and moody s investors service  we amended our credit facility on july   and received a basis point reduction in the margin on our term b loan 
the term b loan now bears interest  at our option  at either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b the base rate  plus between and basis points  in each case as determined according to the rating of the credit facility by standard and poor s and moody s 
the per annum interest rate ending september  was libor  plus basis points 
as of september   the amount outstanding on the term b loan was million 
the average interest rate at september  on the term b loan was after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements we had in effect as of that date 
the revolver bears interest  at our option  at a per annum rate equal to either a the libor rate  plus between and basis points  or b the base rate  plus between and basis points  in each case as determined on a quarterly basis according to a leveraged based pricing grid with leverage ratios from x to x

the credit facility also has certain financial covenants  including  without limitation  maximum leverage ratios  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum net worth and maximum capital expenditures 
our ability to meet our debt service requirements and to comply with such covenants is dependent upon our future performance  which is subject to financial  economic  competitive and other factors affecting us  many of which are beyond our control 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at september  in connection with entering into our credit facility on june   we issued million of senior subordinated notes bearing interest at  maturing on june  the senior subordinated notes are our unsecured obligations  subordinated in right of payment to all our existing and future senior debt in accordance with the subordination provisions of the indenture 

table of contents prior to january   sybron dental management  inc sdm was a guarantor subsidiary of sybron dental specialties  inc sds for our senior subordinated notes 
effective january   sdm was merged into sds 
the senior subordinated notes are generally not redeemable at our option before june  some limited redemption is allowed if we receive cash from an equity offering 
at any time  and from time to time on or after june   we may redeem the senior subordinated notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the percentage of principal amount set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
twelve month period commencing june  percentage and thereafter as a result of the terms of our credit facility  we are sensitive to a rise in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates would result in increased interest expense on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates 
in order to reduce our sensitivity to interest rate increases  from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements 
as of september   we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding aggregating a notional amount of approximately million 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we are required to pay fixed rate amounts equal to the swap agreement rates listed below 
in exchange for the payment of the fixed rate amounts  we receive floating rate amounts equal to the three month libor rate in effect on the date of the swap agreements and the subsequent reset dates 
for each of the swap agreements  the rate resets on the quarterly anniversary of the swap agreement s effective date until the agreement s expiration date 
the net interest rate paid by us on the indicated notional amount is approximately equal to the sum of the relevant swap agreement rate plus the applicable eurodollar rate margin 
the rates and durations as of september  are as follows expiration date notional amount swap agreement date swap agreement rate swap effective date march  million january  march  june  million january  march  sale leaseback in  we completed the sale and leaseback the sale leaseback of our then principal domestic manufacturing and office facilities with an unaffiliated third party 
the transaction has been accounted for as a financing for financial statement purposes  thus the facilities remain in property  plant and equipment 
the transaction was treated as a sale for income tax purposes 
the financing obligation is being amortized over the initial year lease term 
the initial term of each lease is years with five five year renewal options and provides the option to purchase the leased premises at fair market value from june  to may  on the fifth anniversary of the leases and every five years thereafter including renewal terms  the rent is increased by the percentage equal to of the percentage increase in the consumer price index over the preceding five years 
the percentage increase to the rent in any five year period is capped at 
in january   the annual rent payments increased from million to million 
the next adjustment will occur on january  we have the option to purchase the facilities according to the terms of any bona fide offer received by the lessor from a third party at any time during the term of the leases 
we may be obligated to repurchase the property upon the event of a breach of certain covenants or occurrence of certain other events

for a more complete description of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes  please see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
cautionary factors this report contains  and other disclosures that we make from time to time may contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  expect  goal  objective  outlook  could  intend  may  might  plan  potential  predict  should  or will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology signify forward looking statements 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations  contain projections of our future results of operations or our financial conditions  or state other forward looking information 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward looking statements 
although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results 
in addition to the assumptions and other factors referenced specifically in connection with such statements  the following factors could impact our business and financial prospects and affect our future results of operations and financial condition we are a holding company and are dependent upon dividends  interest income and loans from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations 
we are a united states holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries  some of which are located in other countries 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will therefore be dependent on receipt of dividends  interest income and loans from our direct and indirect subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries may be limited in the amounts they are permitted to pay as dividends to us on their capital stock as a result of statutory and other contractual restrictions 
in particular  there are significant tax and other legal restrictions on the ability of non us subsidiaries to remit money to us 
as a result  some or all of our subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends to us 
if they do not  we may not be able to make debt service payments on our debt instruments 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive industry and we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete effectively 
numerous competitors participate in our business segments  some of which have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
our principal competitors in the professional dental business segment include dentsply international inc  m espe and ivoclar vivadent group  and in the specialty products business segment  our principal competitors include m unitek  an affiliate of m company  gac international a subsidiary of dentsply  american orthodontics  nobel biocare and straumann 
some of the companies have a larger sales force and invest more heavily in research  product development and product marketing than we do 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve or maintain adequate market share or margins  or compete effectively  against these companies 
we rely heavily on manufacturing operations to produce the products we sell  and we could be injured by disruptions of our manufacturing operations 
we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce most of the products we sell 
while we do not presently anticipate any significant disruption of those operations  should a disruption occur  for any reason  such as strikes  labor disputes  or other labor unrest  power interruptions  fire  war  or other force majuere  could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business 
in particular  we rely upon our facilities in mexico to manufacture a substantial portion of our orthodontic products 
any disruption in our ability to import those products into the united states could severely impact our orthodontics sales 
although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers  our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices 
our current labor contracts with the united auto workers union at our professional dental business segment s romulus michigan facility will expire on january  we are currently in negotiations to extend the union agreements until january  a work stoppage could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and ship products 
we rely upon others to assist in the education and promotion of our products  and the loss of the participation of these individuals could adversely affect our net sales 
we work with various dental clinicians to educate the dental community on the features and benefits of our products 
some clinicians  such as dr 
dwight damon  are a key component to our strategy for growing our sales 
the inability or unwillingness of one or more of these clinicians to continue to assist us could negatively impact our ability to increase the sales of certain significant products 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we presently have  and will continue to have  a substantial amount of indebtedness which requires significant interest payments 
as of september   we had million in total long term borrowings including current portion  and million in stockholders equity 
in addition  subject to restrictions in the indenture for our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility  we may incur additional indebtedness 
our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences  which include the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service on our senior subordinated notes and other indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to us for other purposes such as potential acquisitions and capital expenditures  
table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest  including through interest rate swap agreements  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
from time to time we have engaged in interest rate hedges to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to employ interest rate hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  our credit facility contains numerous restrictive operating and financial covenants  which could limit our operating flexibility 
our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  and other factors beyond our control 
increases in interest rates would adversely affect our cash flows and therefore our results of operations 
in addition  the terms of any additional debt or equity financing that we may incur could restrict our operational flexibility and prevent us from pursuing business opportunities of value to our stockholders 
we may incur impairment charges on our intangible assets with indefinite lives that would reduce our earnings 
on october   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life be tested at least annually for impairment 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also be tested for impairment between the annual test if an event occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
as of september   goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives represented approximately of our total assets 
if during the testing an impairment is determined  our financial results for the relevant period will be reduced by the amount of the impairment  net of income tax effects  if any 
future exchange rate fluctuations or inflation may adversely affect our results of operations 
we manufacture many of our products  including those in our professional dental business segment  in our facilities in mexico  canada  switzerland  czech republic and italy 
these products are supported by our sales offices in europe  japan  australia  czech republic  south america and mexico 
in fiscal  our foreign facilities selling  general and administrative expenses represented approximately of our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses while our foreign sales represented approximately of our total net sales 
we measure our financial position and results of operations from substantially all of our international operations  other than most us export sales  using local currency of the countries in which we conduct such operations and then translate them into us dollars 
the reported income of our foreign subsidiaries will be impacted by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to a particular local currency 
our us export sales may also be affected by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the value of the us dollar as foreign customers may adjust their level of purchases according to the weakness or strength of their respective currencies versus the us dollar 
in addition  any future increases in the inflation rate in any country where we have operations may negatively affect our results of operations 
to the extent these local currencies depreciate against the us dollar  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents we have engaged in currency hedges to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
if we are unable to  or elect not to continue to employ currency hedges  it could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and profitability 
as we expand our international presence  these risks may increase 
acquisitions have been and continue to be an important part of our growth strategy  failure to consummate strategic acquisitions could limit our growth and failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely impact our results 
our business strategy includes continued growth through strategic acquisitions  which depends upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and our ability to quickly resolve transitional challenges 
failure to consummate appropriate acquisitions would adversely impact our growth and failure to successfully integrate them would adversely affect our results 
these challenges include integration of product lines  sales forces and manufacturing facilities and decisions regarding divestitures  cost reductions  and realizing other synergies 
also  these challenges involve risks of employee turnover  disruption in product cycles and the loss of sales momentum 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully manage them in the future 
also  our credit facility and the indenture for the senior subordinated notes limit our ability to consummate acquisitions by imposing various conditions which must be satisfied 
our profitability may be affected by factors outside our control 
our ability to increase sales  and to profitably distribute and sell our products  is subject to a number of risks  including changes in our business relationships with our principal distributors  competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our markets  pricing and technological competition  risks associated with the development and marketing of new products in order to remain competitive and risks associated with changes in demand for dental services which can be affected by economic conditions  health care reform  government regulation  and more stringent limits on expenditures by dental insurance providers or governmental programs 
we strive to increase our margins by controlling our costs and by improving our manufacturing efficiencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that our efforts will continue to be successful 
margins can be affected by many factors  including competition  product mix  and the effect of acquisitions 
if we are unable to successfully manage growth and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete effectively and our revenues may drop significantly 
we intend to continue to expand our business over time into new geographic regions and additional products and services  subject to the sufficiency of our cash resources and our ability to comply with the covenants in our various debt instruments 
our future performance will depend  in large part  upon our ability to implement and manage our growth effectively 
our growth in the future will continue to place a significant strain on our administrative  operational  and financial resources 
we anticipate that  if we are successful in expanding our business  we will be required to recruit and hire a substantial number of new managerial  finance  accounting  and support personnel 
failure to retain and attract additional management personnel who can manage our growth effectively would have a material adverse effect on our performance 
to manage our growth successfully  we will also have to continue to improve and upgrade operational  financial and accounting systems  controls and infrastructure as well as expand  train and manage our employees 
our failure to manage the future expansion of our business could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our ability to hire and retain competent employees is also subject to a number of risks  including unionization of our non union employees and changes in relationships with our unionized employees 
in particular  many of our non management employees in europe are subject to national labor contracts  which are negotiated from time to time at the national level between the national labor union and the employees council 
there is a risk of strikes or other labor disputes at our locations which are unionized or are subject to national contracts which could affect our operations 

table of contents we rely heavily upon key distributors  and we could lose sales if any of them stop doing business with us 
in fiscal  approximately of our sales were made through our top five independent distributors 
mergers and consolidation of our distributors have temporarily slowed sales of our products in the past and may do so in the future 
we believe that the loss of either one of our top two distributors  the only distributors who account for more than of our consolidated net sales and who sell primarily into the dental segment  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition until we find alternative means to distribute our products 
we are subject to product liability litigation and related risks which could adversely affect our business 
because many of our products are designed for use in and around a patient s mouth  and because many of these products contain chemicals  metals  and other materials  we are subject to claims and litigation brought by patients or dental professionals alleging harm caused by the use of or exposure to our products 
we may need to devote substantial amounts of time and attention to defending ourselves and may also be required to pay large amounts in settlement or upon judgment 
we may also be required to or may voluntarily recall products  which would require substantial effort and cost 
litigation or a product recall could divert significant amounts of our management s time from other important matters 
our business could also be adversely affected by public perceptions about the safety of our products  whether or not any such concerns are justified 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results due to factors outside of our control 
our business is subject to quarterly variations in operating results caused by a number of factors  including business and industry conditions  the timing of acquisitions  distribution chain issues  and other factors beyond our control 
all these factors make it difficult to predict operating results for any particular period 
we may be subject to risks arising from other business and investment considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings or in other publicly written documents 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment abroad could materially adversely affect our business 
our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in canada  switzerland  italy  the czech republic and mexico 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on our foreign operations may materially adversely affect our operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in countries where we have operations differ from those in the united states and our foreign operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks  including  but not limited to changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  affecting our activities in mexico and canada  changes in local labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire and retain local employees  currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency  potentially adverse tax consequences  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  political conditions in countries where we have operations  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  and changes in general economic conditions in countries  such as italy and mexico  that have historically been less stable than the united states 

table of contents if any of the events described were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense  we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development 
the indenture relating to our senior subordinated notes and our credit facility permit us to incur significant amounts of additional debt 
if we incur additional debt  our interest expense will rise 
we may find we do not have enough available cash to pay for the increased interest expense and other budgeted expenses 
we may need to reduce our discretionary expenses  including research and development  which could reduce or delay the introduction of new products 
we may not be able to maintain our level of investment in research and development as we incur more indebtedness and greater interest expense 
certain of our products and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulation  and our failure to obtain or maintain the required regulatory approvals for these products could hinder or prevent their sale and increase our costs of regulatory compliance 
our ability to continue manufacturing and selling those of our products that are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  state laws or other domestic or foreign governments or agencies is subject to a number of risks  including the promulgation of stricter laws or regulations  reclassification of our products into categories subject to more stringent requirements  or the withdrawal of the approval needed to sell one or more of our products 
the costs of complying with these regulations and the delays in receiving required regulatory approvals or the enactment of new adverse regulations or regulatory requirements may force us to cut back our operations  recall products  increase our costs of regulatory compliance  prevent us from selling a product or hinder our growth 
we may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to apogent  or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from apogent 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements executed in connection with our spin off from apogent in december  we and our us subsidiaries  in general  indemnify apogent and its subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of the dental business  including discontinued operations relating to our business 
similarly  apogent and its us subsidiaries indemnify us and our subsidiaries and affiliates against liabilities  litigation and claims actually or allegedly arising out of apogent s business  including discontinued operations related to the laboratory business  and other operations and assets not transferred to us 
these indemnification obligations could be significant 
the availability of these indemnities will depend upon the future financial strength of each of the companies 
we cannot determine whether we will have substantial indemnification obligations to apogent and its affiliates in the future 
we also cannot assure you that  if apogent has substantial indemnification obligations to us and our affiliates  apogent will have the ability to satisfy those obligations 
except as may be required by applicable securities laws or regulations  we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise

table of contents interest rate exposure interest rate risk management we use our credit facility and senior subordinated notes to finance our operations 
the credit facility exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  our interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  our interest expense also decreases 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
these interest rate swaps change a portion of our variable rate cash flow exposure to fixed rate cash flows 
we continue to assess our exposure to interest rate risk on an ongoing basis 
the table below provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of september  for these debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward month libor rates in the yield curve at the reporting date
