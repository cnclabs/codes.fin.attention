item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial statements  financial condition and results of operations of imclone systems 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under risk factors set forth in item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
introduction imclone systems is a biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to advance oncology care by developing a portfolio of targeted biologic treatments designed to address the medical needs of patients with cancer 
we focus on three strategies for treating cancer growth factor blockers  angiogenesis inhibitors  and cancer vaccines 
our lead product  erbitux is a first of its kind antibody approved by the fda for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
erbitux binds specifically to epidermal growth factor receptor egfr  her  c erbb on both normal and tumor cells  and competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor egf and other ligands  such as transforming growth factor alpha 
we are conducting  and in some cases have completed  potential registration studies evaluating erbitux for the treatment of colorectal  head and neck and pancreatic cancers  as well as other indications 
on february   the fda approved erbitux cetuximab injection for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
in addition  the fda also approved lonza s manufacturing facility 
erbitux inventory previously produced at lonza s facility will serve as supply for the initial demand for erbitux 
the company has withdrawn our manufacturing facility  bb  from the cmc section of the bla and submitted on february  a cmc supplemental bla for licensure of the facility 
based on pdufa guidelines  the fda has four months from the submission date to take action on the cmc supplemental bla filing 
the withdrawal and resubmission followed a request from the fda for information on a larger group of patients treated with drug supplied from bb to confirm previously submitted safety data from that facility 
this information has been collected from the company s phase ii erbitux single agent study of patients with egfr expressing refractory metastatic colorectal cancer imcl 
the cmc supplemental bla includes the previously withdrawn bb cmc section  as well as information on the larger group of patients 
subject to licensure of bb within the pdufa timetable  we believe we can meet full commercial demand for erbitux on an ongoing basis 
on december   swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  approved erbitux in switzerland for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer who no longer respond to standard chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan 
merck kgaa  received the approval for erbitux from swissmedic based on the company s european clinical study that included more than patients 
merck kgaa licensed the right to market erbitux outside the us and canada from imclone systems in in japan  merck kgaa has marketing rights to erbitux which are co exclusive to the co development rights of imclone systems and bms 
historically  we have devoted most of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and through collaborations with corporate partners and academic research and clinical institutions 
however  as a result of the approval of erbitux by the fda in february  we anticipate that we will earn royalty revenues on commercial sales of erbitux by our corporate partners 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from collaborative arrangements with our partners 
our revenues  as well as our results of operations  have fluctuated and are expected to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period due to several factors  including but not limited to the amount and timing of revenues earned from commercial sales of erbitux  the timing of when we begin to reflect cost of goods sold in our statement of operations from product sales to our corporate partners  whether we obtain fda approval for our bb manufacturing facility  our ability to manufacture products sufficient to meet demand  the status of development of our various product candidates  whether or not we achieve specified research or commercialization milestones  timely payment by our corporate partners of amounts payable to us  legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  and the addition or termination of research programs or funding support and variations in the level of expenses related to our proprietary product candidates during any given period 
as a result of our substantial research and development costs  we have incurred significant operating losses and have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of december  with the approval of erbitux by the fda on february   we anticipate that our accumulated deficit will decrease in the near future as we begin to earn revenues on commercial sales of erbitux by our partners and as we continue to recognize revenues from license fees and milestone payments 
although we cannot predict the level of revenues we will derive from these sales due to the lack of historical data  we expect that such revenues will offset  in part  our substantial research and development costs 
although we have historically devoted most of our efforts and resources to research and development  we expect to devote greater efforts and resources to the manufacturing  marketing  and commercialization of erbitux 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully manufacture  market  or commercialize erbitux or that potential customers will buy erbitux 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates are deemed critical when a different methodology could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate from period to period may have a material impact on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the company s critical accounting policies that require management to make significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are set forth below 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
revenue recognition historically  our revenues have been derived from three primary sources license fees and milestone payments  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of up front and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb  relating to erbitux and milestone payments received under the development and license agreement with merck kgaa with respect to erbitux 
we recognize all non refundable up front license fees as revenues in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
our most critical application of this policy  to date  relates to the  in license fees received from bms and er squibb under the commercial agreement which are being deferred and recognized as revenue based upon the actual product research and development costs incurred since september  to date by bms and er squibb and imclone systems as a percentage of the estimated total of such cost to be incurred over the year term of the commercial agreement 
the estimated total of such costs is the contractually specified minimum in the commercial agreement with bristol myers squibb 
of the  in up front payments received through december   approximately  was recognized as revenue during the twelve months ended december  and approximately  from the commencement of the commercial agreement through december  the methodology used to recognize deferred revenue involves a number of estimates and judgments  such as the estimate of total product research and development costs to be incurred under the commercial agreement 
changes in these estimates and judgments can have a significant effect on the size and timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  if management had chosen a different methodology to recognize the license fee and milestone payments received under the commercial agreement  the company s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for example  if the company were to recognize the revenues earned from the commercial agreement on a straight line basis over the life of the agreement  the company would have recognized approximately  and  as revenue for the twelve months and from the commencement of the commercial agreement  respectively through december  management believes that the current methodology used to recognize revenues under the commercial agreement is the most appropriate because it reflects the level of expenditure and activity in the period in which it is being spent as compared to the total expected expenditure over the life of the commercial agreement 
payments received under the development and license agreement with merck kgaa with respect to erbitux are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated service period 
non refundable milestone payments  which represent the achievement of a significant step in the research and development process  pursuant to collaborative agreements other than the commercial agreement  are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone 
royalty revenues from licensees  which are based on third party sales of licensed products and technology  are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collection of funds is reasonably assured 
collaborative agreement revenue consists of reimbursements received from bms and er squibb and merck kgaa related to clinical and regulatory studies  erbitux provided to them for use in clinical studies  and certain marketing and administrative costs 
collaborative agreement revenue is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements under the respective contracts 
withholding taxes in january  new york state notified the company that it was liable for the new york state and city income taxes that were not withheld because one or more of the company s employees who exercised certain non qualified stock options in and failed to pay new york state and city income taxes for those years 
on march   the company entered into a closing agreement with new york state  paying  to settle the matter 
subsequently  the company became aware of another potential income and employment tax withholding liability associated with the exercise of certain warrants granted in the early years of the company s existence that were held by certain former officers  directors and employees 
after the company informed new york state of the issue relating to the warrants  new york state  in june  notified the company that it was continuing the previously conducted audit of the company and was evaluating the terms of the closing agreement to determine whether or not it should be re opened 
on march   the company initiated discussions with the internal revenue service the irs relating to the federal income taxes applicable to the above noted issues 
although the irs has not yet asserted that the company is required to make a payment with respect to such failure to withhold  the irs may assert that such a liability exists  and may further assert that the company is liable for interest and penalties 
the irs has commenced audits of the company s income tax and employment tax returns  and new york state has commenced audits of the company s employment tax returns  for tax years through the company is cooperating fully with the irs and new york state with respect to these audits  and intends to continue to do so 
the company has not recognized accruals for penalties and interest that may be imposed with respect to the withholding tax issues described above and other related contingencies  including the period covered by the statute of limitations and the company s determination of certain exercise dates  because it does not believe that losses from such contingencies are probable  or in the event that any taxing authority makes a claim for penalties or interest  the company believes that it will be able to settle the total amount asserted including any liability for taxes for an amount not in excess of the liability for taxes already accrued with respect to the relevant withholding tax issue 
with respect to the statute of limitations and the company s determination of certain exercise dates  while the company does not believe a loss is probable  there is a potential additional liability with respect to these issues that may be asserted by a taxing authority 
if taxing authorities assert such issues and prevail related to these withholding tax issues and other related contingencies  including penalties  the liability that could be imposed by taxing authorities may be substantial 
the potential interest on the withholding tax liabilities could be up to a maximum amount of approximately  at december  potential additional withholding tax liability on other related contingencies amounts to approximately  exclusive of any interest or penalties 
in addition  the company has not recognized withholding tax liabilities in respect of exercises of certain warrants by a former director to whom warrants were issued and previously treated as non compensatory warrants 
based on the company s investigation  it believes that  although such warrants were compensatory  such warrants were received in connection with the performance of services by him in his capacity as a director  rather than as an employee  and  as such  are not subject to tax withholding requirements 
in addition  in  this former director erroneously received a portion of a stock option grant in the form of incentive stock options  which under federal law may only be granted to employees 
there can be no assurance  however  that the taxing authorities will agree with the company s position and will not assert that the company is liable for the failure to withhold income and employment taxes with respect to the exercise of such warrants and stock options by said director 
if the company became liable for the failure to withhold taxes on the exercise of the warrants and any stock options by this director  the aggregate potential liability  exclusive of any interest or penalties  would be approximately  production costs to date  all costs associated with the manufacturing of erbitux have been included in research and development expenses when incurred 
effective february   the date in which the company received approval from the fda for erbitux  we expect to begin to capitalize in inventory the cost of manufacturing erbitux for commercial sale and will expense such cost as cost of goods sold at the time of sale 
however  as we sell our existing inventory that was previously expensed  there will be a period of time whereby the company will reflect product and royalty revenues with no corresponding cost of goods sold 
although it is currently impossible to project demand for erbitux due to lack of historical experience  we may have sufficient inventory to supply our corporate partners with product for a significant period 
as we begin to package our bulk inventory  we will capitalize the cost of packaging and labeling such inventory 
therefore  we anticipate that our gross margin on sales of erbitux to our corporate partners will fluctuate significantly in and from quarter to quarter 
for example  we may experience a quarter whereby there will be no cost of goods sold on product sales and royalties earned from sales of erbitux  quarterly results that may reflect product sales and royalty revenues with cost of goods sold consisting solely of packaging and labeling cost  and we may experience quarterly results where some of our revenues will have no corresponding cost  partial cost  or fully loaded cost of goods sold 
therefore  we believe that our gross margin will be distorted for comparison purposes for a significant period after february  depending on market demand for erbitux 
in addition  we anticipate that the comparability of our cost of goods in the future may also be impacted due to differences in the cost of goods sold for inventory manufactured by lonza and inventory manufactured at bb litigation the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings as fully disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 no reserve has been established in our financial statements for these legal proceedings because we do not believe that a loss is probable 
however  if in a future period  events in any such legal proceedings render it probable that a loss will be incurred  and if such loss is reasonably estimable at that time  we will establish such a reserve 
thus  it is possible that legal proceedings may have a material adverse impact on the operating results for that period  on our balance sheet or both 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate that their full carrying value may not be recovered 
assets are considered to be impaired and written down to fair value if expected associated undiscounted cash flows are less than carrying amounts 
fair value is generally determined as the present value of the expected associated cash flows 
we have built bb and are building bb  and purchased a material logistics and warehousing facility 
bb is dedicated to the clinical and commercial production of erbitux and bb will be a multi use production facility 
erbitux is currently being produced for clinical studies and commercialization at bb the material logistics and warehousing facility includes office space  a storage location and sampling laboratory for erbitux 
the newly renovated administrative facility houses the clinical  regulatory  sales  marketing  finance  human resources  project management and mis departments  as well as certain executive and legal offices and other necessities 
based on management s current estimates  we expect to recover the carrying value of such assets 
changes in regulatory or other business conditions in the future could change our judgments about the carrying value of these facilities  which could result in the recognition of material impairment losses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
as of december  the company has provided a valuation allowance against its total gross deferred tax assets because  more likely than not  its gross deferred tax assets will not be realized 
although management believes that our reserves as of december  for these uncertainties are appropriate  we expect that as we sell erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use and earn royalties from the expected commercial sales of erbitux  we will need to revise our conclusions regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets due to expected changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
in addition  there may be other factors such as changes in tax laws  future levels of research and development spending and future levels of capital expenditures that may impact our effective tax rate in the future 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the interpretation replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was issued on january  the effective date of fin r depends on whether the reporting enterprise is a public or nonpublic company and on the nature of the entity in which the reporting entity has a variable interest 
the adoption of this accounting pronouncement will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the comparable period in we derive our revenues from three primary sources license fees and milestone revenue  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
the increase in revenues in is primarily as a result of an increase in license fee and milestone revenue of  partially offset by a decrease in collaborative agreement revenue of  and in royalty revenue of  license fees and milestone revenue total license fees and milestone revenue in of  consist of recognition of up front payments received under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb of approximately  recognition of payments received under the development and license agreements with merck kgaa of  and license fees from glaxosmithkline plc 
glaxo of  the increase in license fees and milestone revenue from of  is due to an increase in revenue recognized under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb as a result of increased expenditures in product research and development during by bms and er squibb and imclone systems and the receipt of an additional payment of  from bms during royalty revenue royalty revenue consists primarily of royalty payments received from abbott pursuant to the licensing of some of our diagnostic products and techniques on a worldwide basis 
during we earned royalty payments of  primarily from abbott  a decrease of  from the corresponding period in the decrease is due to the fact that abbott discontinued the sales of these products during  therefore we expect that any royalties in the future will be minimal as they exhaust their existing inventory 
in addition  as a result of the approval by swissmedic in december of of erbitux in switzerland  we earned approximately  of royalty revenue on sales of erbitux by merck kgaa in switzerland during the month of december with the approval of erbitux by the fda in february and the approval in switzerland by swissmedic in december of  we expect that our royalty income will experience a significant increase beginning in the second quarter of as our partners bms and er squibb and merck kgaa sell erbitux in their respective approved markets 
collaborative agreement revenue collaborative agreement revenue consists of reimbursements from our partners bms and merck kgaa under our collaborative agreements 
there are three primary categories for which we receive reimbursement from our partners clinical and regulatory expenses  the cost of erbitux supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies  and certain marketing and administrative expenses 
during  we earned  in collaborative agreement revenue of which  represents amounts earned from bms and er squibb and  represents amounts earned from merck kgaa as compared to  earned in of which  was earned from bms and er squibb and  was earned from merck kgaa 
the decrease in collaborative agreement revenue in of  is primarily due to a decrease in product supplied to merck kgaa during for use in clinical studies 
with the approval of erbitux in both switzerland and the united states  we will begin to sell inventory to our partners for their subsequent commercial sale 
therefore  we expect an increase in revenues derived from the sale of inventory for commercial distribution by our partners 
we also anticipate that the majority of the increase will be derived from sale of inventory to bms and er squibb  which based on our agreement with such parties  will be at cost plus a markup 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the corresponding period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses of  a decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses of  a decrease of  due to a recovery of a previous write off in of  relating to a withholding tax liability and a decrease of  relating to expenses associated with the bms acquisition  stockholder and amended commercial agreements 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical and regulatory expenses of  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in research and development expenses include costs associated with our in house and collaborative research programs  product and process development expenses  costs to manufacture erbitux and other product candidates prior to any approval that we may obtain of a product candidate for commercial sale and quality assurance and quality control costs 
research and development reflect costs that are reimbursable from our corporate partners 
approximately  and  of costs reflected in research and development for the years ended december  and  respectively  are reflected under collaborative agreement revenue since they represent inventory supplied to our partners for use in clinical studies 
with the approval of erbitux by the fda on february   our research and development expenses will no longer reflect prospectively from that date the cost associated with manufacturing erbitux 
costs incurred in the production of erbitux for sale to our corporate partners will be included in inventory and expensed as cost of goods sold at the time of sale of such inventory 
the decrease in research and development expenses of  for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately  related to cost incurred in connection with the manufacturing of erbitux by lonza  a contract manufacturer 
for the years ended and  research and development included approximately  and  respectively of inventory cost manufactured by lonza under a service agreement that was completed by june of this decrease was partially offset by increased expenditures in discovery research and increased costs associated with the full scale production of bb the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investment in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug or biological product to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of pre clinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct human clinical studies for drugs or biologics  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and filing by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a nda for a drug product or a bla for a biological product to allow commercial distribution of the drug or biologic 
due to the inherent risks associated with candidate discovery and development  as well as the regulatory approval process  we  by necessity  manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a manner designed to generate new clinical candidates into development 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments assigned to any one program prior to the phase iii stage of development or the future cash inflows from these programs 
clinical and regulatory clinical and regulatory expenses for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in clinical and regulatory expenses consist of costs to conduct our clinical studies and associated regulatory activities 
the increase experienced in is primarily as a result of incremental costs incurred due to increased activity in our clinical programs including an increase of approximately  in salary and benefits based on increased headcount during approximately  and  of the costs included in this category for the years ended december  and  respectively is reflected as revenues under collaborative agreement since they represent costs that are reimbursable by our corporate partners 
we expect to continue our investment in our clinical programs and therefore  we expect increased clinical and regulatory expenditures in the future 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses include marketing and administrative personnel costs  including related facility costs  additional costs to develop internal marketing and field operations capabilities  costs to pursue arrangements with strategic corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses also include amounts reimbursable from our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  a decrease of  or from the comparable period in this decrease is primarily due to a payment made in the second quarter of for separation compensation and other post employment benefits of  associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
in addition  during april  bms paid us  which represented the refund of a previously written off deposit related to the exclusive right to negotiate a long term supply agreement with lonza  which was recognized as a decrease to marketing  general and administrative expenses in this decrease was partially offset by a payment of  in related to an employment agreement with a former executive officer and an increase in marketing expenses of approximately  incurred in order to support our marketing efforts going forward 
we expect incremental expenditures in marketing  general and administrative expenses as we continue to support our commercialization efforts for erbitux and as we continue to build the necessary infrastructure that will support the expected growth of our business 
recovery write down of withholding tax assets and industrial development revenue bonds tax expense in  we recognized the recovery of the previous write down of the withholding tax asset and the elimination of the withholding tax liability of  attributable to the exercise of warrants by our former general counsel  john b 
landes  because mr 
landes has represented to us that he has paid the taxes associated with this liability 
the write down of withholding tax assets in of  is primarily composed of the write down that was reversed in in april  the company discovered that we were in breach of certain covenants in our industrial development revenue bonds due may issued by the new york industrial development agency the ida bonds 
we recorded additional tax expense of  for the year ended december  and  of additional tax expense for during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service in settlement of our federal income tax liabilities associated with the ida bonds for an amount less than previous estimates of federal tax liability 
as a result  the company has recognized a benefit of  attributable to the recovery of tax expense attributable to the ida bonds 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average monthly cash and cash equivalents balance and a decrease in interest rates associated with our portfolio of marketable securities 
interest expense was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in the overall decrease in interest expense from the year ended december  to was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized during the construction of bb in branchburg  new jersey  from  to  interest expense for both periods included interest on the convertible subordinated notes due march  the convertible subordinated notes issued in february  interest on the ida bonds with a principal amount of  which were redeemed on june   interest on financing our corporate insurance and interest recorded on various capital lease obligations under a financing agreement with finova technology finance  inc finova and with ge capital leasing 
we recorded gains on securities available for sale of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent net realized gains from the sale of investments in our available for sale securities portfolio  which as of december  amounted to  provision for income taxes income taxes of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are the result of various tax law changes in the state of new jersey  one of which is the establishment of the alternative minimum assessment tax to which we are subject 
net losses we had a net loss to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or per share for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss and net loss per share to common stockholders was due to the factors noted above 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the comparable period in we derive our revenues from three primary sources license fees and milestone revenue  royalty revenue  and collaborative agreement revenue 
the increase in revenues in is primarily as a result of an increase in collaborative agreement revenue of  partially offset by a decrease in license fees and milestone revenue of  and in royalty revenue of  license fees and milestone revenue total license fees and milestone revenue in of  consist of the recognition of payments received under the commercial agreement with bms and er squibb of approximately  and license fee revenue received under the development and license agreements with merck kgaa of  and license fees from glaxo of  the decrease in license fees and milestone revenue in of  from the comparable period in  is primarily due to a decrease of  in milestone revenue received from merck kgaa partially offset by an increase of  in license fee revenue earned from bms and er squibb in royalty revenue royalty revenue consists primarily of royalty payments received from abbott pursuant to the licensing of some of our diagnostic products and techniques on a worldwide basis 
during we earned royalty payments of  primarily from abbott  a decrease of  from the corresponding period in collaborative agreement revenue collaborative agreement revenue consists of research and development funding revenues derived from our collaborative agreements with bms and merck kgaa 
during  we earned  of which  represents amounts earned from bms and er squibb and  from merck kgaa  as compared to  earned in of which  was earned from bms and er squibb and  was earned from merck kgaa 
the increase in collaborative agreement revenue in of  is primarily due to an increase in product supplied to merck kgaa during for use in clinical studies and also due to a full year of bms activity in compared to four months in operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  amounted to  an increase of  or from the corresponding period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in research and development and clinical and regulatory expenses of  and in marketing  general and administrative expenses of  partially offset by a decrease in withholding tax asset expense of  and in expenses associated with the bms acquisition  stockholder and amended commercial agreements of  research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in research and development expenses include costs associated with our in house and collaborative research programs  product and process development expenses  costs to manufacture erbitux and other product candidates prior to any approval that we may obtain of a product candidate for commercial sale or committed purchase obligations of our corporate partners  and quality assurance and quality control costs 
research and development expenses include costs that are reimbursable by our corporate partners 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the costs associated with full scale production at bb  costs related to the manufacturing services agreements with lonza  expenditures in the functional areas of product development and pilot plant manufacturing associated with our other monoclonal antibodies and increased expenditures associated with discovery research 
clinical and regulatory clinical and regulatory expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in clinical and regulatory expenses consist of costs to conduct our clinical studies and associated regulatory activities 
the decrease experienced in is due to the fact that the majority of the expenses associated with clinical studies for erbitux were incurred before and there was a decrease in the level of expenditures during due to regulatory uncertainty of erbitux 
approximately  and  of the costs included in this category for the years ended december  and  respectively  are reflected as revenues under collaborative agreement since they represent costs that are reimbursable by our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses include marketing and administrative personnel costs  including related facility costs  additional costs to develop internal marketing and sales capabilities  costs to pursue arrangements with strategic corporate partners and technology licensors  and expenses associated with applying for patent protection for our technology and products 
marketing  general and administrative expenses also include amounts reimbursable from our corporate partners 
marketing  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  an increase of  or in the increase in marketing  general and administrative expenses primarily resulted from the second quarter separation compensation and other post employment benefits of  associated with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer  dr 
samuel d 
waksal  legal expenses associated with the pending class action lawsuits  shareholder derivative lawsuits and investigations by the sec  the subcommittee on oversight and investigation of the us house of representatives committee on energy and commerce and the us department of justice expenses associated with higher public relations costs due to the factors noted in above  expenses associated with higher insurance premiums with respect to director and officer liability insurance  the write off of an expired negotiating right with lonza of  in and expenses associated with general corporate activities 
write down of withholding tax assets write downs of withholding tax assets for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  reflects the write down of a  asset  offsetting withholding tax liabilities of the same amount  incurred upon the failure to withhold upon the exercise of certain non qualified stock options and certain warrants granted to our former president and chief executive officer  dr 
samuel d 
waksal 
in and prior years  we generally did not withhold federal  state or local income taxes at the time of exercise of non qualified stock options or warrants 
the majority of these exercise transactions occurred during the years ended december  and during the second quarter of  we wrote off  attributable to our failure to withhold on a warrant exercise by john b 
landes  our former general counsel 
industrial development revenue bonds tax expense in april  we discovered that we were in breach of certain covenants in our ida bonds 
we therefore recorded additional tax expense of  for each of the years ended december  and relating to these bonds 
interest income  interest expense and other income expense interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates associated with our portfolio of debt securities 
interest expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or in the overall decrease in interest expense from to was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of interest capitalized during the construction of bb in branchburg  new jersey  from  to  interest expense for both periods included interest on the convertible subordinated notes issued in february  interest on the ida bonds with a principal amount of  which were redeemed on june   interest on financing our corporate insurance and interest recorded on various capital lease obligations under a financing agreement and a financing agreement with finova 
we recorded gains on securities and investments of  and losses of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net losses on securities and investments for the year ended december  included  in write downs of our investment in valigen nv and a  write off of our convertible promissory note from act group  inc these losses were partially offset by gains in our portfolio of debt securities of  during the year ended december  provision for income taxes income taxes of  for the year ended december  are the result of various tax law changes in the state of new jersey  one of which is the establishment of the alternative minimum assessment tax ama to which we are subject 
net losses we had a net loss to common stockholders of  or per share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or per share for the year ended december  the increase in the net loss and net loss per share to common stockholders was due to the factors noted above 
liquidity and capital resources at december  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale of approximately  as compared to  at december  historically  we have financed our operations through a variety of sources  most significantly through the issuance of public and private equity and convertible notes  license fees and milestone payments and reimbursements from our corporate partners and interest income and net realized gains earned on cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale 
summary of cash flows years ended december  thousands of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    historically our cash flows from operating activities have fluctuated significantly due to the nature of our operations and the timing of our cash receipts 
during  we used  of cash for operating activities primarily due to the fact that we invested approximately  in research and development and clinical and regulatory activities in support of our ongoing investment in these areas  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
we also incurred approximately  in marketing general and administrative expenses to support our operations including incremental expenses related to building our marketing infrastructure in order to support our commercialization efforts of erbitux 
in addition  we also incurred net interest expense including amounts capitalized of approximately  these expenses  less depreciation and amortization of approximately  were partially offset by the receipt of  in license fee payments and approximately  related to reimbursements under our collaborative agreements 
with the approval of erbitux by the fda on february   we expect that our operating cash flows will experience significant fluctuations in future periods as a result of an increase in milestone payments in and expected increases in revenues from the commercial sale of erbitux 
net cash flows provided by investing activities increased by  and  in and  respectively 
our primary sources and uses of cash under investing activities are from the net activity in our securities available for sale portfolio  which we manage  based on our liquidity needs and amounts invested in capital expenditures 
a significant portion of our capital expenses relate to the construction of bb and equipping bb for the manufacturing of erbitux 
during  our cash flows from investing activities increased by  due to an increase in net sales of securities available for sale  partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures 
during  we operated under regulatory uncertainty as to whether we would receive fda approval for erbitux 
as such  we decided to delay some of our capital expenditures until during  our net cash flows from investing activities increased by  primarily due to an increase in sales of our securities available for sale portfolio  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures 
we expect that our investment in capital expenditures in will increase as we continue the construction of bb net cash flows provided by financing activities increased by approximately  in primarily due to  received from merck kgaa based upon the achievement of certain defined milestones for which merck kgaa received equity in imclone systems 
on december   swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  approved erbitux in switzerland for the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer who no longer respond to standard chemotherapy treatment with irinotecan 
on february  the fda approved erbitux cetuximab injection for use in combination with irinotecan in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are refractory to irinotecan based chemotherapy and for use as a single agent in the treatment of patients with egfr expressing  metastatic colorectal cancer who are intolerant to irinotecan based chemotherapy 
as a result of the fda s approval of erbitux  we received a milestone payment of  from bms and er squibb on march  the receipt of these funds will provide the company with the necessary liquidity to fund our projected operating expenditures and our investment and financing commitments in although it is impossible to predict the level of revenues that we will generate from the sale of erbitux by our corporate partners due to the lack of historical data  we anticipate that our business model and therefore our future financial condition and our future operating performance will experience significant changes 
therefore  past performance will not be indicative of our future performance 
for example  we will begin to generate revenues from the commercial sale of erbitux by our corporate partners 
we will also generate revenues from the sale of erbitux to our corporate partners for commercial use 
in addition  we will experience a period of time whereby our revenues will not have corresponding cost of goods sold prior to utilization of all inventory manufactured prior to date of approval by the fda  since we have previously expensed such cost as research and development 
as of december  the company had long term debt outstanding of  consisting of convertible subordinated notes due march  we are considering financing alternatives available to the company with respect to this indebtedness 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and the milestone payment of  received on march  as a result of the fda approval of erbitux  will provide us with sufficient liquidity to support our operations at least through december   and beyond 
we are also entitled to reimbursement for certain marketing and research and development expenditures and certain other payments  some of which are payable contingent upon the achievement of research and development milestones 
such contingent amounts include  in cash based payments under our commercial agreement with bms and er squibb  as well as up to  in equity based milestone payments under our erbitux development and license agreement with merck kgaa and up to  in cash based milestone payments under our bec development agreement with merck kgaa 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve these milestones 
our future working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to progress and cost of our research and development programs  pre clinical testing and clinical studies  the amount and timing of revenues earned from the commercial sale of erbitux  whether we obtain fda approval for the bb manufacturing facility  our corporate partners fulfilling their obligations to us  timing and cost of seeking and obtaining additional regulatory approvals  timing and cost of manufacturing scale up and effective commercialization activities and arrangements  level of resources that we devote to the development of marketing and field operations capabilities  costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  technological advances  legal costs and the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings and investigations  status of competition  our ability to maintain existing corporate collaborations and establish new collaborative arrangements with other companies to provide funding to support these activities  and the adequacy of our estimations of liabilities for tax related matters discussed above

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our holdings of financial instruments comprise a mix of us dollar denominated securities that may include us corporate debt  foreign corporate debt  us government debt  foreign government agency guaranteed debt and commercial paper 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
generally  we do not invest in portfolio equity securities  commodities  foreign exchange contracts or use financial derivatives for trading purposes

our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we invest in securities that have a range of maturity dates 
typically  those with a short term maturity are fixed rate  highly liquid debt instruments and those with longer term maturities are highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates or with periodic interest rate adjustments

interest on the securities is adjusted monthly  quarterly or semi annually  depending on the instrument  using prevailing interest rates 
these holdings are highly liquid and we consider the potential for loss of principal to be minimal 
our outstanding fixed rate convertible subordinated notes in the principal amount of  due march   are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the fair value of fixed interest rate instruments are affected by changes in interest rates and in the case of the convertible notes by changes in the price of our common stock as well
