introduction we are a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced power conversion products and board level computing solutions incorporated into embedded communications systems 
we generate revenue and earn profits through the sale of these products to oem s and distributors  predominately in the communications industry 
our operations are global  with design  manufacturing and sales resources in north america  europe and asia 
our business is organized into two operating segments  power conversion and communications products 
the power conversion group designs  manufacturers and sells ac dc and dc dc power conversion products 
the communications products group designs  manufactures and sells cpu boards and wan i o boards bundled with software protocols embedded in communications infrastructure systems 
the two segments share a strategic direction  but have separate operations 
our products are used in commercial applications in the server and storage  networking  wireless infrastructure and telecommunications sectors of the communications industry 
our revenue is dependent on the success of our customers products and services  which incorporate our products as a component or sub system 
our customers success is impacted by macroeconomic and industry trends  primarily corporate spending on information technology and capital spending by communication services providers 
spending in these areas contracted sharply in  and  to a lesser extent  in the first half of in the fourth quarter of  spending appeared to recover as evidenced by the higher revenues reported across the industry 
in evaluating our products  customers consider quality  reliability  technology  service and cost relative to our competitors 
the trend towards dpa is the technological shift having the greatest impact on our products 
we are investing heavily in pol and other dpa technologies in order to grow our competitive advantage in this area 
in order to meet the cost requirements of our customers  we have consolidated our production in low cost countries 
we generate cash through net income  efficient working capital and capital equipment management and equity and debt financing transactions 
although we incurred significant net losses in the past three years  we generated substantial cash through reductions in working capital and by minimizing capital equipment purchases 
we are financed through a mixture of equity and debt 
we took actions in to lengthen our debt maturities and to allow us more flexibility to invest in our business 
our debt is in the form of convertible senior subordinated notes due and an asset based senior revolving credit facility  the availability under which is determined in accordance with a borrowing base calculation using domestic accounts receivable and inventory 
overview beginning in and continuing through  there was a decrease in demand experienced throughout the communications industry as consumers of computing and communications equipment became more conservative with their capital investment plans 
the decline in our revenue that followed resulted in substantial operating losses  as we were unable to reduce our cost structure in line with the revenue reductions 
the operating losses required waivers from our lenders and a renegotiation of terms on our existing revolving credit agreement  including reductions in the amount available for borrowing  during in the fourth quarter of  we announced a series of restructuring actions to significantly lower operating costs 
the restructuring plan provided a path to return to profitability and executing that plan was a primary focus of management 
entering  we identified four goals for the year achieve quarterly profitability  improve liquidity  grow revenue and continue to invest in research and development 
these goals were substantially achieved as outlined below 
achieve quarterly profitability 
in  we executed our restructuring plan  including the closure of our kindberg  austria and youghal  ireland factories and consolidating production in our lower cost china and hungary plants 
these and other actions reduced excess capacity and better aligned our cost structure with our revenue stream 
the cost reductions combined with an increase in end market demand resulted in a profit being recorded in the fourth quarter of  the first quarterly profit since improve liquidity 
we entered the year with million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  due to expire in  and a million convertible subordinated note  due in  but redeemable by the note holder finestar in january in august  we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes  due in and used a portion of the net proceeds to pay off the finestar note 
we also replaced our prior credit facility with a five year  million senior revolving credit facility with fleet capital 
the financing transactions undertaken in have lengthened our debt maturities and provide greater flexibility to make longer term investments in our business 
we also generated million of operating cash flow primarily driven by reductions in working capital 
the operating cash flow and the cash provided by the financing activities described above  allowed us to fund capital expenditures and increase cash by million to million at the end of the year 
grow revenue 
sales in increased from to million driven by new product introductions and improvement in end market demand 
revenue increased sequentially from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter  as demand improved across all of our market sectors late in the year 
continue to invest in research and development 
although we reduced our cost structure  we continue to invest in technology and new products to grow our business 
we invested million or of revenue on research and development in  consistent with our spending 
we exited in a substantially stronger competitive and financial position 
with the improvements made to our cost structure and liquidity  our focus in will be on growing the business 
our goals for are to grow market share  enter new communications market segments  continue to invest in industry leading technology and maintain profitability for the year 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risk related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly  and we consult with our sales and customer service organizations in order to determine the projections for each component and finished good 
because of the magnitude of the value of our inventory  any adjustment to excess and obsolete inventory would likely be material to our results 
the estimate of inventory reserves is critical in both of our segments 
we refined our calculation related to estimating our excess and obsolete inventory reserves during the fourth quarter of the refinement resulted in an increase to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve of million in the fourth quarter of the year 
in  our gross inventory continued to decrease due to increased demand  enhanced resource management and the disposal of obsolete inventory 
these factors contributed to a significant decrease in the reserve balance at the end of compared to at december   our inventory reserve balance was million  representing of the value of our gross inventory 
this compares with million  or of gross inventory  at the end of warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products returned to us during such warranty period at no cost to the customer 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and communications with our customers 
changes in such estimates can have a material effect on net income and require us to forecast expected warranty claims 
the estimate of warranty obligations is critical in both segments 
the reserve is determined by first comparing the historical relationship between warranty costs  which are made up of labor and materials required to repair the parts returned  and revenue over the prior two years to calculate a rate 
the rate is then applied to shipments under warranty using a sliding scale  based on historical return patterns 
the reserve also includes specific large exposures that are probable and reasonably estimated 
we have recognized expenses related to warranty costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
each of these represents approximately of revenue in their respective periods 
our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
goodwill we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
on december  under sfas no 
 we assess goodwill using a two step approach on an annual basis in august of each year  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
sfas no 
states that potential impairment exists if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the assets of that unit 
the amount of the impairment to recognize  if any  is calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our initial application of sfas no 
did not indicate an impairment existed 
management s assumptions about future sales and cash flows on which the fair value estimate is based require significant judgment as prices and volumes fluctuate due to changing business conditions 
in addition  the impact of recognizing a goodwill impairment charge was material to our results of operations in and could be material in the future to our consolidated financial results 
during  based on business conditions at that time  we performed an updated assessment of impairment of goodwill 
as a result of this assessment  we recognized an impairment loss of during the third quarter of the year 
for additional information on the assessment and impairment  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we performed the same test in the third quarter of  and determined an impairment did not exist 
as of december   the balance of goodwill was million  making our estimate of future earnings critical 
we will continue to assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
to the extent we decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include a benefit within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
a change in these estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the net operating loss carryforwards that make up our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on historical tax positions  tax planning strategies and expectations about future taxable revenue by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the net deferred tax assets are million and million  net of the valuation allowance  at the end of and  respectively 
results of operations consolidated sales 
the following table summarizes revenue by business segment in comparison to previous periods in millions compared to compared to power conversion communications products artesyn solutions total in communications products  the increase in compared to million is primarily attributable to increases in sales to our wireless and telecommunications customers  as several new programs entered development and our customers experienced an increase in end user demand 
in power conversion  the decrease in revenue compared with million is due primarily to a decrease in sales to our server and storage customers in the first half of this was partially offset by an increase in sales to our distribution customers reflecting the impact of expanding our distribution network 
during  we realized sequential growth as revenue increased from million in the first quarter to million in the fourth quarter 
revenue growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across all of our markets due to new product introductions and increased end user demand as spending on information technology and capital spending by communications service providers increased 
based on orders received in the fourth quarter of and our customers forecasts  we expect the higher level of demand to continue through the first half of the decrease in sales in compared to is primarily the result of a significant decrease in demand we experienced from most of our major customers starting in early the decreased level of customer demand was driven by lower spending on information technology and reduced capital spending by communication service providers 
the reduction in sales was also impacted by the sale of artesyn solutions in the fourth quarter of if the impact of artesyn solutions were removed  the reduction in sales in compared to would be million  or 
gross profit 
below is a comparison of gross profit and gross profit as a percent of revenue for  and in millions compared to compared to gross profit inventory charges gross profit excluding inventory charges gross profit as a percent of revenue gross profit as a percent of revenue excluding inventory charges included in the results are charges of approximately million for increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves as a result of a change in the reserve calculations 
the charges were recorded in cost of sales  and reflect a refinement in our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory resulting from industry trends toward shorter product lifecycles and other factors 
we did not record charges for excess and obsolete inventory outside of our normal recurring adjustment in the increase in gross profit  excluding the impact of the additional inventory charge million  was primarily the result of manufacturing cost reductions resulting from our restructuring actions taken during the last two years approximately million and improvements in volume and sales mix 
manufacturing costs were reduced due to the closure of our kindberg  austria factory in april  the closure of our youghal  ireland factory in september  headcount reductions across all of our factories and lower inventory charges due to the significant reduction of inventory on hand 
in  our communications products segment accounted for approximately of our total sales compared to approximately in the increased sales recorded by communications products  which includes higher margin software content and a historically higher pricing structure than power conversion  was the primary reason for the improved sales mix 
we also experienced sequential improvement in gross profit as a percent of revenue during  as our gross profit percentage increased from in the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
the improvement during was primarily the result of cost reductions from the restructuring actions discussed above 
the decrease in gross profit in compared to was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue in compared to approximately million 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by the exclusion of artesyn solutions from our consolidated results in approximately million and supplier cancellation charges incurred in approximately million 
these effects were somewhat offset by cost savings from our manufacturing locations  accounting for the balance of the change between periods 
during  we recorded a charge related to excess and obsolete inventory of million related to raw materials purchased and finished goods manufactured to fulfill orders cancelled or delayed as customer demand unexpectedly decreased in the period 
this charge corresponds to the charge recorded in of million previously discussed 
the restructuring actions to reduce excess capacity and lower manufacturing costs were largely complete at the end of gross profits in will be favorably impacted by the full year effect of the restructuring actions implemented throughout additionally  higher demand will increase manufacturing capacity utilization  which was approximately at the end of  allowing for better coverage of fixed costs and an improvement in gross profit as a percent of revenue 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for  and are as follows in millions of revenue selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring and related charges goodwill impairment goodwill amortization gain on sale of artesyn solutions total operating expenses included in was a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  resulting from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million 
the effect in was a reduction of approximately million  accounting for the increase in sg a from to excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sg a decreased million in compared to as a result of the restructuring actions taken since these actions  which are discussed below in restructuring and related charges  were intended to reduce infrastructure and personnel and to maintain the proper relationship between operating expenses and revenue 
these cost saving initiatives are also the primary reason for the dollar reductions in sg a in as compared to in addition  approximately million of the decrease in sg a in compared to is attributable to the exclusion of artesyn solutions after its sale 
research and development expenses totaled million  or of sales  in both and there were some reductions in research and development expenses in as a result of the restructuring actions  but these amounts were offset by additional expenses related to the increase in new product introductions in the fourth quarter 
while we have reduced our research and development expenses and consolidated engineering facilities over the last several years to maintain an appropriate relationship with revenue  we believe a strong commitment to invest in research and development activities is vital to our ability to provide our customers with technologically capable  low cost product alternatives 
as a result  we expect the level of research and development expenses in to maintain its current relationship with revenue 
restructuring and related charges 
pursuant to our restructuring plans  we recorded the following restructuring and related charges in millions employee termination costs liability for payback of development grants facility closures total restructuring charges the amounts recorded in were related to the transfer of manufacturing functions to our china facility and further consolidation of our business in europe 
the amount recorded in included amounts related to the closure of our kindberg and youghal manufacturing facilities 
although the closures were not completed until  the majority of the expenses were recorded in during  the charges reflect the closure of our manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and several engineering and administrative facilities worldwide 
as part of ongoing restructuring efforts  we expect to record total charges of approximately million in  primarily related to costs that were not yet incurred when the restructuring was initiated  such as asset transfer costs and final amounts related to our restructuring actions in europe 
for additional information on our restructuring actions  please see note of our consolidated financial statements 
amortization impairment of goodwill 
on december   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization but is subject to an annual impairment test 
we have not recorded and will not record amortization expense related to goodwill in any period after adoption of sfas due to adverse business conditions in our end markets  we performed impairment tests of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
in the third quarter of the result of these tests indicated an impairment existed and a goodwill impairment loss was recognized in the power conversion segment for million and the communications products segment for million during the third quarter 
the total impairment charge of million is included in operating expenses in our annual assessment of the fair value of our reporting units was performed in in accordance with sfas no 
 and no additional impairment was recognized 
gain on sale of artesyn solutions 
during december  we sold our repair and logistics business  artesyn solutions  inc  to solectron global services  inc for million 
a substantial portion of the net proceeds was used to pay down outstanding debt 
the gain on the transaction was million and was included as a line item offset in operating expenses in loss on debt extinguishment 
losses on debt extinguishment were million in compared with million in in conjunction with the placement of our convertible notes in  a portion of the net proceeds from the placement was used to pay off our then outstanding million obligation to finestar 
the losses on debt extinguishment were comprised of the accretion of the remaining debt discount related to the transactions with finestar million along with the write off of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs million 
for additional information on the placement of convertible debt completed in and the transaction with finestar international limited  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in march  we entered into a new asset based revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation  which replaced our prior revolving credit facility 
loss on debt extinguishment in also includes million in expense related to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in association with our previous credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an agreement to amend the revolving credit facility in place at that time 
one of the results of this amendment was a reduction in the overall availability borrowing capacity under the agreement 
we recorded debt extinguishment expenses of million at the time related to the reduction in the facility s capacity 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net is detailed as follows in millions compared to compared to interest expense less interest income net interest expense we entered with substantially lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility compared to the beginning of during the first quarter of  we replaced our then existing revolving credit facility with a new  million  five year revolving asset based credit facility with fleet capital corporation 
using cash generated from operations  the outstanding debt on our credit facility was further reduced to zero at the end of  compared to million at the end of the reduction in interest expense was primarily the result of the reduced level of borrowings 
as discussed above  the note previously outstanding with finestar was paid off in the third quarter of as a result of the placement of convertible notes in  the million note outstanding with finestar at was replaced with million of notes at 
the additional borrowings and the higher interest rate will result in higher interest expense in compared to benefit for income taxes 
below is a comparison of the benefit for income tax and effective tax rate for  and in millions benefit for income taxes effective tax rate the difference in the and tax rates is the result of the non deductibility of goodwill written off and losses in certain tax jurisdictions that require a valuation allowance for the related deferred tax benefits 
we record deferred tax assets for tax benefits on losses 
we continually evaluate whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  and record a valuation allowance when appropriate 
if we continue to experience losses or elect to cease operations in certain tax jurisdictions  we may need to record additional valuation allowances in the appropriate jurisdiction  and our effective tax rate could change significantly 
the primary reasons for the difference between the effective tax rates in compared with periods was the non deductibility of the majority of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in along with the valuation allowance of million recorded in related to deferred tax assets in hungary 
net loss 
the net loss recorded in each of the last three years is as follow in millions  except per share data net loss net loss per basic and diluted share basic and diluted shares outstanding in comparison to  the improvement in net loss in resulted from the goodwill impairment loss  the additional excess and obsolete inventory charges and the significantly higher restructuring charges that were recorded in in addition  the higher gross profit as a result of manufacturing cost savings contributed to the improvement 
the primary reasons for the increased loss in in comparison to were the goodwill impairment charge recorded in  the gain on the sale of artesyn solutions recorded in and the reduction in revenue as discussed above 
there was no amortization expense recognized in related to goodwill  which partially offset the negative factors discussed above 
power conversion results for the power conversion segment in compared with prior years are as follows in millions compared to compared to revenue operating loss the decrease in revenue recorded in compared to was primarily the result of a decrease in sales to our server and storage customers somewhat offset by increases in sales to distribution customers 
the decline in server and storage revenue reflected lower demand from the purchasers of information technology and occurred primarily in the first half of the year 
during and  we made additional investments in our infrastructure designed to better service our distribution customers 
these investments consisted of expanding our sales staff and distribution networks in the us and europe  resulting in the growth in sales to distribution customers 
during  all of the markets serviced by our power conversion segment eroded compared to the reduction in end user demand was the single most important factor in the decline of the segment s revenue in compared to the primary reason for the reduction in the operating loss in was the million charge for goodwill impairment recorded in along with the restructuring charges recorded in in excess of the amount recorded in million 
the remainder of the difference is attributable to the additional excess and obsolete inventory charges recorded in million and costs savings resulting from the restructuring actions 
the goodwill impairment charge in is also the primary reason for the increase in the operating loss in compared to the remainder of the difference is attributable to the decrease in revenue million and an increase in restructuring charges million offset by amortization of goodwill recorded in million and the effect of cost savings initiatives 
communications products results for the communications products segment in compared with prior years are as follows in millions compared to compared to revenue operating income loss the increase in revenue in our communications products segment in compared to is primarily the result of increases in sales to our wireless and telecommunications customers 
the increase reflects the introduction of new products and higher sales of existing products as customers responded to improved end user demand 
the decrease in revenue in compared to reflects the decrease in demand in the wireless and telecommunications market sectors resulting from the reduction in capital spending by communications service providers 
the primary reason for the improvement in operating income in compared to is the goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in increased revenue in compared to was a substantial factor in the improvement approximately million  with the remainder of the difference being the inventory charge and restructuring expenses recorded in the goodwill impairment charge is also the primary difference between the operating loss recorded in in comparison to  along with the effect of lower revenue million 
these amounts were partially offset by the amortization expense recorded in million and cost savings resulting from restructuring actions 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statement information for each of the past three years in millions except statistical data cash and cash equivalents long term debt and capital leases convertible subordinated debt cash net of debt working capital statistics days of sales outstanding days of inventory on hand days of accounts payable outstanding the primary sources of cash currently available to us are cash on hand and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility 
these amounts are available to finance capital expenditures and payments of interest on our convertible senior subordinated debt 
movements in our working capital and cash flows from net income can be either sources or uses of cash  depending on prevailing business conditions 
during  our cash and equivalents increased from million at the end of to million at the end of the primary sources of cash were the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes in the third quarter of along with reductions in inventory and increases in accounts payable during the year 
these amounts were offset by the repayment of our note outstanding with finestar and amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility  increases in accounts receivable  capital expenditures and payments associated with previous acquisitions 
cash flows from operating activities 
during  our cash flows from operating activities served as a source of cash of million 
an improvement in the performance of our working capital accounts was the significant component of our sources of cash from operations in we were able to reduce our balances in inventory significantly while maintaining our performance in accounts receivable and extending our terms in accounts payable 
inventory decreased due to programs  such as vendor managed inventory  put in place to reduce inventory requirements 
operating cash flows were impacted by million in payments related to restructuring actions and million in federal income tax refunds in over the past three years  we have significantly improved our working capital performance as evidenced by the reduction in days of sales outstanding and days of inventory on hand and the increase in days of accounts payable outstanding 
looking forward  we anticipate only modest improvement in our accounts receivable and accounts payable performance  as we believe we are operating close to an optimal level for our industry 
we expect to continue to improve our inventory performance through better demand management and increased use of vendor managed inventory 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities reflect a net cash use of million in  comprised primarily of capital expenditures million and deferred payments related to previous acquisitions 
capital expenditures for the last two years have been below the level we would normally require to maintain and improve our manufacturing capabilities 
the plant closures that occurred have provided us with enough available equipment that we have been able to maintain the necessary manufacturing capacity 
trends in design are resulting in a higher number of surface mounted components in our products 
these trends  combined with the expectation of higher demand  are dictating an increase in the number of smt lines  automated test equipment and other related production equipment we currently utilize 
as a result  our capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately million in compared to the million recorded in in  we made deferred or contingent payments related to the acquisitions of spider software limited and azcore technologies  inc for approximately million 
the remaining million of contingent consideration for the azcore acquisition was paid in the first quarter of all deferred or contingent obligations related to past acquisitions have been satisfied 
for additional information on our acquisitions  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities 
in  cash flows from financing activities were a source of cash of million in the primary source of cash was the issuance of million of convertible senior subordinated notes due the net proceeds from the issuance were partially offset by the payoff of a million convertible subordinated note to finestar and payoffs related to the two revolving credit arrangements we had in place during on august   we completed an initial placement to qualified institutional investors of million of our convertible senior subordinated notes due  and on august   we completed the sale of an additional million 
net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes in the third quarter of were approximately million 
the placement was completed in order to replace the convertible note that had previously been issued to finestar and to provide us with additional long term working capital 
the note with finestar was to mature in and contained a provision that allowed either party to redeem the note in january the new convertible debt issuance extended the maturity date and removed the possibility of redemption on the part of the holder 
there are no financial covenant requirements associated with the convertible senior subordinated notes 
for additional information on the terms of the notes  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we received an investment by finestar  an entity controlled by mr 
bruce cheng  founder and chairman of delta electronics  a leading global power supply  electronic component and video display manufacturer and one of our competitors 
after the first closing of our august placement of convertible senior subordinated notes due  we fully paid the convertible subordinated note outstanding with finestar 
additionally  because the finestar note has been paid in full  the shares of our common stock underlying the convertible note are no longer issuable upon conversion or subject to the registration statement on form s filed in connection with the finestar transaction 
on march   we entered into a new five year  million senior revolving credit facility with fleet capital corporation 
the asset based facility replaced our prior senior revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march for additional information on the terms of our new asset based revolver  please see note of the consolidated financial statements 
on the day the agreement was completed  we used million of cash on hand to pay off the amounts outstanding under our previous credit facility 
we then borrowed million on the new facility  resulting in a net reduction of total outstanding borrowings of million 
while the total availability under the facility is limited to million  the amount available to be borrowed is based on our level of qualifying domestic accounts receivable and inventory  which is subject to changing business conditions 
generally  as our level of qualifying accounts receivable and inventory increases  our availability increases up to the prescribed limit 
as of the end of the year  our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was zero  and our availability was million 
in addition to other affirmative and negative covenants customary for asset based credit facilities  we are also subject to an ebitda covenant that is triggered when the amount available to be borrowed plus cash deposited with fleet falls below million 
as of the end of the year  the availability and the cash deposited with fleet were above the prescribed limit  and we were not subject to the additional covenant 
up to million of the facility s capacity can be used for letters of credit 
our sources of cash are the cash we currently have on hand  the availability we maintain on our asset based credit facility and expected cash generated from net income 
we are expecting to generate cash from net income in  but if our projections are significantly below our expectations  we believe that our other sources of cash are sufficient to cover our operating expenses  capital expenditures  restructuring requirements and interest payments for the next twelve months 
if we are not able to generate cash from operations for a sustained period of time  we would  after our cash on hand and available line of credit were depleted  need to identify additional sources of cash 
these sources could include additional issuances of debt or equity  sales of equipment or portions of the business 
from a long term perspective  our sources of cash are expected to remain the same 
we are dependent on generating cash from net income as our primary long term source of cash 
we would be required to identify other long term sources of cash if we were not able to generate cash from net income or if we decided to take on a strategic initiative  such as an acquisition  which would require cash 
we continually evaluate options with respect to additional financing  including the sale of debt or equity instruments and portions of the business 
any such financing or sale transactions could have an adverse effect on our stock price and could dilute our shareholders ownership interest in our company

economic and business conditions in the communications industry have caused us to incur significant losses in recent years  and our losses will continue if demand for communications infrastructure does not improve 
we have incurred significant losses in  and due to a drop in demand for our products resulting from a reduction in spending on computing and communications infrastructure during that time 
while we are seeing a reversal of this trend which is reflected in improvements in revenue in the second half of  we had net losses of million  million which includes non cash after tax write offs of million in goodwill impairment charges and million in additional excess and obsolete inventory charges and million for  and  respectively 
growth in the communications industry has been driven primarily by the expansion of the internet  broadband and wireless networks 
during the past three years  these applications have suffered a significant downturn 
our future revenue growth depends in large part on the resumed growth of these services as widely used media for commerce and communication 
in addition  unless we take steps to further reduce our cost structure  we do not anticipate a significant increase in profitability without revenue growth 
if demand for our products does not improve  we could continue to experience operating losses 
our future profitability depends on our ability to successfully market our products in a volatile  competitive industry characterized by rapidly changing prices  technologies and customer demand 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and  in some cases  short product life cycles 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment as well as an accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
to respond to the needs of our customers in the communications industry  we must continuously develop new and more advanced products at lower prices 
we are making significant investments in next generation technologies but there can be no assurance that these investments will lead to additional revenue and profitability 
our inability to properly assess developments in the communications industry or to anticipate the needs of our customers could cause us to lose business with our current customers and prevent us from obtaining new customers 
price erosion could have a material effect on our profitability 
we operate in an industry where quality  reliability  stability  product capability and other factors influence our customers decisions to purchase our products 
the price of our products is also a factor  and it could become a more important factor the more competitive our industry becomes 
the competitive nature of our industry could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  each of which would adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our strategies to manage the competition include  but are not limited to  maintaining an appropriate level of investment in research and development and sustaining and expanding relationships with our customers in the high growth sectors of our industry  however  there can be no assurance that such strategies will be effective 
we face risks by having most of our manufacturing capacity concentrated in foreign locations in  approximately of our total sales were from products manufactured in china and europe 
the closure of our facilities in austria and ireland in has further concentrated our manufacturing capacity of our power conversion segment to our low cost facilities in china and hungary 
we would expect the percentage of products sold that were manufactured in foreign locations to be in excess of of our total sales in the cost structure of these facilities and its relationship to our customers expectations for the price of our products makes our future success dependent on the ability to efficiently utilize our foreign manufacturing locations 
international operations are subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  interruptions in air or sea transportation  political or economic changes  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences  any or all of which could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products and deliver those products to our customers 
we rely on significant relationships with a small number of customers and the loss of any of those customers could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
our ten largest customers accounted for of our total sales for the fiscal year  with sales to hewlett packard  dell computer and sun microsystems accounting for approximately  and of our total sales  respectively 
while we are designed into and derive revenue from several distinct products with each customer  decisions by a small number of our customers to defer their purchasing decisions or to purchase products elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if we were to experience an unanticipated catastrophic quality issue ie  a product or design failure with one of our customers especially one of our three largest customers that threatened our relationship with that customer  the competitive nature of our industry could allow that customer to terminate its relationship with us and move its business to one of our competitors 
although we are designed in to many long term customer programs enabling us to be included in our customers new products over a product lifecycle  significant parts of our business depend primarily on continued relationships with our existing customers 
if one or more of such relationships are terminated for any reason  or significantly reduced  it could significantly reduce our total sales  thereby greatly impacting our future operating results and profitability 
if demand for our products were to increase  we could face production capacity constraints very quickly due to recent restructuring actions 
during the recent decrease in demand  we closed manufacturing facilities in broomfield  colorado  kindberg  austria  and youghal  ireland and moved production from these plants to our lower cost facilities in tatabanya  hungary and zhong shan  china 
our current capabilities are in line with what we expect to be required to produce over the near term 
if demand were to increase from our expectations  we would be forced to add additional production capacity on very short notice 
we began to see a turnaround in demand in the latter half of if our capacity constraints keep us from fulfilling customers orders  it could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations 
consolidating our manufacturing capacity into lower cost facilities could result in production delays and quality issues 
the decrease in demand experienced by our company and our industry over the past few years led to our decision to close several manufacturing and engineering facilities and move the production of a number of products to lower cost facilities 
although the closures and transfers have been completed  transition issues that normally occur when a new product goes into production at a new location may still result in production delays or quality issues 
any problems associated with delays of shipments to customers  cancellations of delayed shipments  diversion of management attention  increases in inventory levels  increases in quality issues  increases in warranty returns or an inability to achieve anticipated manufacturing cost reductions could result in a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face risks associated with the sale of our products in foreign locations 
international sales have been  and are expected to continue to be  an important component of our total sales 
in  international sales represented of our total sales 
because our customers do business in international locations  our future success is dependent on our continued growth and our ability to administer our sales operations in foreign markets 
the success and profitability of our international operations is subject to inherent risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  increased import duties  interruptions in air or sea transportation  political or economic changes  difficulties in managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  foreign currency exchange rates and potentially adverse tax consequences  any or all of which could adversely affect our operations 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain 
as a result of the custom nature of certain of our manufactured products  components used in the manufacture of these products are currently obtained from a limited number of suppliers  and a small percentage of components are purchased from a single vendor 
a change in suppliers  which could take several months to properly transition  could cause a delay in manufacturing  additional manufacturing costs  and a possible loss of sales that could adversely affect our future operating results and financial position 
with an asset based credit facility  we face risks associated with fluctuating credit availability 
the amount available for borrowing under our senior credit facility is calculated as a percentage of our domestic accounts receivable and inventory that meet certain criteria as set forth in the credit agreement  minus reserves as determined by our lender 
our lender maintains the right to change the advance rates and eligibility criteria for our domestic accounts receivable and inventory and the discretion to change or institute new reserves against our availability 
accordingly  the amount available for borrowing under our senior credit facility may be reduced due to the reduction in the amount of our eligible assets resulting from changing market conditions  and the application of or changes to eligibility criteria  as well as the reduction of advance rates and or the increase or change in reserve amounts  which may be imposed at the discretion of our lender 
these factors could have the result of reducing the amount we may borrow under the facility at a time when we have a need to borrow additional amounts or requiring repayments under the facility at a time when we do not have adequate cash flow to make such repayments or when such repayments may not be in our best interest due to the economic climate and or our financial condition at that time 
these consequences could negatively impact our liquidity and such impact could be material 
as of december   however  there were no amounts outstanding on our asset based revolving credit facility 
the provisions of our credit agreement could affect our ability to enter into certain transactions 
on march   we entered into a five year  million credit facility with fleet capital corporation 
the asset based facility replaced our prior revolving credit facility that was due to expire in march our credit agreement may restrict our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions including  among other things  the disposition of assets  making certain capital expenditures and forming or acquiring subsidiaries unless we obtain the prior written consent of fleet capital corporation 
because we cannot guarantee that fleet capital corporation will  in all circumstances  provide consent for the specific purposes for which we intend  our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions may be prohibited or delayed 
market consolidation could create companies that are larger and have greater resources than us 
our principal competitors include acbel polytech taiwan  delta electronics taiwan and thailand  emerson electric  invensys uk  lite on taiwan  power one  and tyco international 
if our competitors consolidate  they would likely create entities with increased market share  customer bases  proprietary technology  marketing expertise and sales forces and would likely have increased purchasing leverage for acquiring raw materials 
such a development may create stronger competitors  which would likely adversely affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve 
we face  and might in the future face  intellectual property infringement claims that might be costly to resolve 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting that our products or technology infringe on a third party s patent or other intellectual property rights 
such claims have resulted in litigation in the past  and could result in litigation in the future 
if we do not prevail in any such litigation  our business may be adversely affected  depending on the technology at issue 
in addition  our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and  in some instances  vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have on occasion resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
we cannot make the assurance that intellectual property claims will not be made against us in the future or that we will not be prohibited from using our technologies subject to any such claims or that we will not be required to obtain licenses and make corresponding royalty payments 
in addition  the necessary management attention to  and legal costs associated with  litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
currently  we are a defendant in one such patent infringement suit with vlt  inc for additional information on the vlt lawsuit  please refer to item legal proceedings and note of the consolidated financial statements 
our future success could depend on the protection of our intellectual property  costs associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our operating results 
we generally rely on patents and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in some of our technology and products  and such protections may become more important in our industry 
while we have been issued a number of patents and other patent applications are currently pending  there can be no assurance that any of the patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that any rights granted under these patents will  in fact  provide us with competitive advantages 
in addition  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims on future patents will be broad enough to protect our technology 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity of and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
our future profitability may be adversely affected by a change in governmental regulation 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could result in the need to modify products and could affect the demand for our products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
we rely on certain key personnel and a loss of such personnel could adversely affect our business 
if we lose one or more members of senior management  or if we cannot attract and retain qualified management or technical personnel  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our capacity to develop and implement new technology depends on our ability to employ personnel with highly technical skills 
competition for such qualified technical personnel is intense due to the relatively limited number of engineers available 
increased leverage as a result of the issuance of our convertible debt may harm our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had million of outstanding debt as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet included in this filing 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and the notes do not restrict our future issuance of indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of interest required with respect to outstanding indebtedness  increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  as well as to competitive pressure  and depending on the levels of our outstanding debt  our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  and general corporate and other purposes may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to the success of the marketing of our products  general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required  among other things to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the notes  or to sell selected assets 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our convertible notes upon a change of control 
our convertible notes issued during include a provision that the note holders have the right to tender the notes and request that the notes be repurchased if a change of control occurs 
should a change of control occur  no assurance can be given that we will have sufficient funds available to purchase notes that are tendered for repurchase or that we will be able to arrange financing on favorable terms 
a failure to repurchase the tendered notes constitutes an event of default under the indenture 
our board of directors ability to issue preferred shares could deter a change in control that could be profitable to our shareholders 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  as amended  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock in connection with our poison pill  and to establish the preferences and rights of any such shares of preferred stock issued 
the issuance of the preferred shares can have the effect of creating preferential dividends and or other rights and or delaying  making more difficult  or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
we have a poison pill that could deter a potentially profitable take over by a third party 
under our company s rights agreement  rights are issued along with each of our shares of common stock 
a holder of such rights can purchase from us  under specified conditions  a portion of a preferred share  or receive common stock of our company  or receive common stock of the entity acquiring us having a value equal to twice the exercise price of the right 
the exercise price of the right is 
this arrangement is often called a poison pill 
our poison pill may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company  even if a change of control is in the shareholders interest 
there are certain provisions of florida law that could limit acquisitions and changes of control 
the florida business corporation act  as amended  contains a section entitled control share acquisitions  which  in certain circumstances  eliminates the voting rights of shares acquired in quantities so as to constitute control shares  as defined under florida law 
florida law may also restrict business combinations between our company and owners of our common stock unless approved by two thirds of the voting shares of disinterested shareholders or by a majority of our company s disinterested directors 
these provisions may also have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for our company or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current price 
our former independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  has been found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges and involved parties are unlikely to be able to exercise effective remedies against such firm in any legal action 
our former independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  provided us with auditing services for prior fiscal periods through december   including issuing an audit report on our fiscal consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
on june   a jury in houston  texas found arthur andersen llp guilty of a federal obstruction of justice charge arising from the federal government s investigation of enron corp 
on august   arthur andersen llp ceased practicing before the commission 
arthur andersen llp has not reissued its audit report with respect to our audited consolidated financial statements  has not consented to the inclusion of its audit report and has not performed any procedures in connection with this filing 
as a result  there may not be an effective remedy against arthur andersen llp in connection with a material misstatement or omission with respect to our audited consolidated financial statements that are included in this report or any other filing we may make with the commission  including  with respect to any offering registered under the securities act or any claim under section of the securities act 
in addition  even if such a claim could be asserted  as a result of its conviction and other lawsuits  arthur andersen llp may fail or otherwise have insufficient assets to satisfy claims made by investors or by us that might arise under federal securities laws or otherwise relating to any alleged material misstatement or omissions with respect to our audited consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in connection with any future capital market transaction in which we are required to include financial statements that were audited by arthur andersen llp  as a result of the foregoing  investors may elect not to participate in any such offering or  in the alternate  may require us to obtain a new audit of previously audited financial statements 
consequently  our financing costs may increase or we may miss a capital market opportunity 
our shareholders will be diluted if we issue shares subject to options  warrants  convertible notes or payment of matching contributions under our k plan 
as of december   we had reserved the following shares of our common stock for issuance  shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants held by finestar international  which are subject to anti dilution provision that provide for adjustments to the exercise price of the warrants for issuances of additional securities below certain prices   shares issuable pursuant to stock options outstanding   shares available for future grant under the company s stock option plans   shares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior subordinated notes issued in august  shares for the purpose of making matching contributions under our k plan item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of derivative financial instruments 
in the past  we have managed our interest rate risk on variable rate debt instruments through the use of interest rate swaps  pursuant to which we exchange our floating rate interest obligations for fixed rates 
the fixing of the interest rates offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates during the term of the debt 
we have significant assets and operations in europe and asia and  as a result  our financial performance could be affected by significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate potential adverse trends  our operating strategy takes into account changes in exchange rates over time 
accordingly  in the past  we have entered into various forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenues 
the principal currency hedged was the euro 
it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet the objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
gains or losses that result from changes in foreign currency rates are recorded at the time they are incurred 
these gains or losses have not been material in any recent periods 
we currently have no hedging instruments outstanding
