advertisers have the ability to develop different ads for the same product or service that are designed for specific audiences  ensuring that the message appeals to all of the audience for the commercial 
different advertising messages are then simultaneously targeted to households through the use of technology that permits set top boxes to seamlessly jump between video signals  thereby invisibly tailoring the video experience to the profile of the viewing household

as of december   we had a total of people in our sales and marketing organization located in the united states  europe and asia pacific 
competition the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
current and potential competitors in one or more aspects of our business include interactive television technology companies and companies developing interactive television content and applications 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality  speed of product integration  breadth of network and platform coverage  scalability  price  possession of adequate intellectual property rights and sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents our competitors offering interactive television enabling technology include nds group plc  microsoft corporation  liberate technologies and scientific atlanta  inc nds group historically provided conditional access and limited interactive application technologies to its customers 
in  it extended its interactive services offerings with its acquisition of mediahighway from thomson multimedia and has begun to offer solutions that are more directly competitive with many of those that we offer 
nds group is controlled by the news corporation 
the news corporation recently completed its acquisition of a controlling stake in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  one of the two largest satellite operators in the united states 
the news corporation also controls bskyb  the largest satellite operator in the united kingdom and one of our most significant customers  and other satellite operators throughout the world 
while we continue to work with  and provide technology and services to many affiliates of the news corporation  including bskyb  its control of nds group  and the extension by nds group of its product offering  may significantly increase our competitive pressures and affect the willingness of other news corporation affiliates to work with us or to obtain products or services from us 
we cannot  therefore  be certain of the long term implications related to news corporation s control of nds group or the effects that such control may have upon our relationships and opportunities to work with the many satellite operators throughout the world that are controlled by news corporation 
for several years  microsoft corporation has been working to create interactive television solutions 
with equity interests in several network operators  microsoft may be able to influence the network operator s choice of providers of interactive television solutions 
we expect that microsoft will likely become a strong competitor in the market for interactive television solutions 
liberate technologies manufactures and licenses its software to network operators and set top box manufacturers and has announced relationships with several united states and united kingdom cable operators 
scientific atlanta  inc  in the form of powertv  develops and markets operating system and middleware software products for the advanced digital interactive cable television markets 
scientific atlanta is also a major manufacturer of set top boxes  and many of our customers or potential customers may seek to deploy set top boxes manufactured by scientific atlanta 
we have in the past competed with  and expect in the future to continue to compete with  both liberate and scientific atlanta 
in the markets for enhanced television technology and services and addressable and interactive advertising technology  our primary competition comes from companies such as navic networks  visible world corporation and nds group 
addressable and interactive technology is in its initial stages  and we expect additional competitors to appear as the market continues to develop 
navic provides set top data services for data connectivity to  from  and among digital set top boxes 
visible world provides a suite of services enabling a media outlet to develop and deliver content and advertising that can be geographically and demographically customized as well as dynamically updated based on business parameters  market trends and demands 
in the area of research and audience measurement  which we have begun efforts to market  we may encounter competition from traditional providers such as nielsen media research  agb group and tns  as well as new entrants into the markets such as digisoft or erin media inc nielsen media and others have significantly more experience and brand recognition in this sector than we do 
we may  therefore  be at a significant disadvantage in light of the market acceptance and long term relationships that many of our likely competitors will have 
while we expect that interactive television betting and gaming may provide a future source of potential growth  we also expect to face intense competition in jurisdictions in which we are permitted to deploy those product offerings 
companies with which we expect to compete include tvg network  bskyb and fancy a flutter 
because this aspect of interactive television remains nascent  we cannot be certain as to how competition will develop or the precise nature of the competitors that we may expect to encounter 
because of the significant regulatory issues affecting this sector and the benefits derived from operating under that regulatory framework over a long period  we may also face competition in the future from more traditional casino companies with long histories in the betting and gaming sector 

table of contents our interactive applications face competition from numerous parties 
companies that compete with our efforts to develop and launch applications on our middleware platform include dedicated applications providers such as gemstar tv guide international  nds  visiware  worldgate communications  and metatv  independent third parties that develop and provide applications for our middleware platform  and other middleware providers such as microsoft  liberate technologies and canal technologies we also face competition from media companies that have publicly announced interactive television initiatives  such as the discovery channel  espn  time warner cable and cnn 
in addition  certain network operators such as bskyb in the united kingdom have entered into agreements  joint ventures  and other relationships with technology and entertainment companies 
we expect competition in the interactive content and applications area to intensify as the general market for interactive television services further develops  particularly in the case of independent third parties that have the ability to develop applications for our middleware platform at relatively modest expense through the use of our applications development tools 
in the professional services area  we compete with third party system integrators such as accenture and imagine broadband  as well as with internal information technology staffs at our network operator customers 
other interactive television technology providers  such as liberate technologies and nds group  also provide a level of professional services in conjunction with their product offerings 
regulations the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  the online distribution of content and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
recent attempts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include an initiative by cable network operators in the united states to create a uniform platform for interactive television called open cable and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a platform called multimedia home platform 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products or services to respond to these developments  or otherwise hurt our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
if  and to the extent that  we continue to develop applications for the gaming and betting market  we also expect to become subject to additional regulatory oversight 
those laws and regulations are quickly evolving and changing 
to adequately address the legal and regulatory issues inherent in that market  we will need to dedicate significant resources to those matters and maintain effective controls to monitor changes in various laws and the effects on our business 
intellectual property and research and development as of december   we had patents issued in the united states  patents issued outside of the united states  and patent applications pending throughout the world 
we believe that our patent portfolio protects many of the key elements necessary to support digital interactive television 
our research and development expenses  excluding in process research and development charges related to acquisitions  amortization of share based compensation  and non cash warrant expense  for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in engineering  in sales  marketing  service and support  in content and programming and in finance and administrative services

liberate technologies  inc 
on february   opentv  inc  our subsidiary  filed a lawsuit against liberate technologies  inc alleging patent infringement in connection with two patents held by opentv  inc relating to interactive technology 
the lawsuit is pending in the united states district court for the northern district of california 
on march   liberate technologies filed a counterclaim against opentv  inc for alleged infringement of four patents allegedly owned by liberate technologies 
liberate technologies has since dismissed its claims of infringement on two of those patents 
in january  the district court granted two of opentv  inc s motions for summary judgment pursuant to which the court dismissed liberate technologies claim of infringement on one of the remaining patents and dismissed a defense asserted by liberate technologies to opentv  inc s infringement claims  resulting in only one patent of liberate technologies remaining in the counterclaim

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview we are one of the world s leading providers of software and solutions for interactive and enhanced television 
we derive our revenues from the licensing of our core software and related technologies  the licensing and distribution of our content and applications and the delivery of professional services 
we typically receive one time royalty fees from manufacturers or network operators once a set top box  which incorporates our software  has been shipped to  or activated by  the network operator 
we also receive professional services fees from consulting  engineering and training engagements  fees for the maintenance and support of our products and fees from revenue sharing arrangements related to the use of our interactive content and applications 
in addition  we also receive ongoing licensing fees for various software products that we sell 
our financial results are largely dependent upon the continued development of the digital television market and the related capital expenditures being made and expected to be made in the future by network operators to implement those enhanced technologies 
during  reductions by network operators in their capital spending and rollout of interactive television related products  and similar reductions by other participants in the interactive television market  had a significant adverse effect on the overall digital television market  and  as a result  on our results of operations 
we addressed these economic issues by controlling and reducing expenses during the second half of and into in  several of our existing network operator customers accelerated their marketing efforts for digital television  and  as a result  we experienced an increase in revenue from in addition  our operating results for the past several years have been affected by various acquisitions that we completed 
we acquired static holdings limited in  wink communications  inc in  actv  inc in july  and substantially all of the assets of bettingcorp limited in august we earn significant revenues from customers who are  or were  strategic investors in our business and certain other related parties 
in august  liberty media corporation acquired a controlling interest in us from mih limited 
as of december   liberty media s total ownership represented approximately of the economic interest and approximately of the voting power of our ordinary shares on an undiluted basis 
revenues from these current and former related parties and their controlled affiliates are set forth in the table below in millions 
other than liberty media  none of the parties referred to in the table below held an equity interest  as of december   in our company that exceeded five percent 
year ended december  motorola and general instrument echostar mih limited and its affiliates liberty media affiliates time warner wowtv there has been a worldwide trend of consolidation in the cable and satellite industries 
we believe this trend is likely to continue due to economic and competitive concerns and it appears to be expanding to include 
table of contents other companies involved with the interactive television industry 
the news corporation  for example  recently completed its acquisition of a controlling stake in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  one of the two largest satellite operators in the united states 
the news corporation also controls british sky broadcasting  the largest satellite operator in the united kingdom and one of our most significant customers  and other satellite operators throughout the world 
it also controls one of our competitors  nds group plc 
that type of consolidation  and similar trends in the industry  may affect our long term relationships with various customers and may also affect our ability to obtain business in the future 
while the short and long term effects of this trend remain uncertain  they may require us to modify our business to adapt to those changing relationships with industry participants and to address competitive concerns that may arise as companies consolidate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regards to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred tax assets  valuation of investments in privately held companies  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and restructuring costs 
all of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine what portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events 
professional services revenues from software development contracts  customization services and implementation support are recognized generally on the percentage of completion method 
for fixed bid contracts under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
the actual results could differ from the percentage estimates by the time a project is completed 
the recognition of revenues is partly based on our assessment of the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection of accounts receivable had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 

table of contents valuation allowances we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider our potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of our valuation allowance 
currently we have a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
adjustments may be required in the future if we determine that an amount of deferred tax assets can be realized 
valuation of investments in privately held companies we invest in equity and debt instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic objectives  and typically we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks of these investments 
we perform periodic reviews of these investments for impairment 
our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investee s operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value that is other than temporary and that the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  need for additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value  which is the amount we believe is recoverable from the investment 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets our long lived assets include goodwill and other intangible assets  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and in the case of goodwill  annually 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is revenue growth 
estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments that can be significantly impacted by changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  competition and demographic trends 
if our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
restructuring costs we monitor our organization structure and associated operating expenses periodically 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken to restructure the business  including terminating employees  abandoning excess lease space and incurring other exit costs 
any resulting restructuring costs include numerous estimates made by us based on our knowledge of the activity being affected and the cost to exit existing commitments 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
years ended december   and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of or million  from million in revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of or million  from million in royalties accounted for of revenues in  in and in the acquisitions of wink  actv and the bettingcorp assets accounted for 
table of contents million of revenues in and million of revenues in revenues by line item were as follows in millions year ended december  royalties services  support and other fees and revenue shares license fees total revenues royalties 
we derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes and other products that incorporate our software to manufacturers and network operators around the world 
royalty revenues are dependent on continued deployment of set top boxes by existing customers  upgrades to newer versions of our software by existing customers and new customers launching our technologies in their systems 
should set top box deployments and software upgrades by existing customers slow or the acquisition of new customers not occur  our royalty revenues would be negatively impacted in future years 
as there are a limited number of network operators capable of deploying interactive television on a large scale basis  we expect that our ability to achieve incremental royalty revenues could diminish in future years 
we recognize royalties upon notification of unit shipments or activation of our software by manufacturers or network operators 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenues upon delivery of the software 
royalties for the year ended december  were million  an increase of or million from million in growth was experienced in all regions 
europe had an increase of million due to strong shipments by bskyb  which was partially offset by lower shipments by other customers in europe 
americas had an increase of million due to strong shipments by echostar  which was partially offset by lower shipments by other customers 
asia pacific had an increase of million 
royalties for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of or million  from million in during we experienced a significant decline in set top box shipments 
the decline was especially acute in europe  where unit volume declined by in compared to in americas there was a nominal increase in royalties due to strong shipments by echostar  which was offset by lower shipments by other customers 
in asia pacific there was also a significant decline in royalties in five of our customers sell set top boxes to bskyb  which accounted for million  or  of royalties in and million  or  of royalties in in  a marketing payment we made to bskyb of million was offset against revenues we received from bskyb in accordance with new accounting regulations that generally require us to offset consideration we give to a customer against revenue received from that customer  rather than recording the consideration as an expense 
from an accounting perspective  this resulted in a negative amount of revenues from bskyb of million in the echostar royalty revenue is being amortized over the seven year term of our echostar agreements because echostar has a right to receive unspecified future applications when they are made available 
as such  the royalties recognized from echostar were million  or of royalties  in  million  or  in and million  or  in until we are able to recognize that royalty revenue  amounts that we receive from echostar are recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
our former controlling stockholder  mih limited  through its subsidiaries  purchased set top boxes from two of our customers 
effective april   all royalties were paid directly to us by the mih subsidiaries 
mih subsidiaries  directly and indirectly  accounted for million of royalties in  zero royalties in and million of royalties in services  support and other 
services  support and other revenue consist primarily of professional services consulting engagements for set top box manufacturers  network operators and system integrators and maintenance  support and training for set top box manufacturers and network operators 
as a result of a general 
table of contents slowdown in interactive television related spending by our customers in  revenues in this category have declined for the last two years

the remaining minimum guaranteed level of business through the end of is million

liberty media and affiliates accounted for million of services  support and other revenue in and million in mih limited and its related entities accounted for million of services  support and other revenue in  million in and million in echostar accounted for million of services  support and other revenue in  million in and million in fees and revenue shares 
fees and revenue shares consist of playjam games channel fees  interactive advertising fees  net betting and gaming revenues  and revenue shares received for advertising and other interactive services 
for the year ended december   fees and revenue shares were million  an increase of million  or  from million in our playjam fees accounted for million of the increase due to favorable currency exchange rates 
advertising fees related to the acquisition of wink accounted for an increase of million due to the inclusion of wink for twelve months in compared with four months in our betting and gaming fees related to the acquisition of the bettingcorp assets accounted for million in revenue shares accounted for an increase of million 
for the year ended december  fees and revenue shares were million  an increase of million from million in the increase was attributable primarily to the inclusion of playjam fees for twelve months in compared with six months in  and the development of new and more popular games combined with the introduction of an interactive payment mechanism 
advertising fees related to the acquisition of wink accounted for million in digital interactive television group  or ditg  a british telecommunications company that supports the collection from end users of premium rate telephony fees for the playjam channel on bskyb  accounted for million of our total fees and revenue shares for compared with million for individuals who play games on the playjam channel make payments to their telecommunications provider 
however  we receive our revenues from ditg  which acts as the payment intermediary 
on december   our carriage agreement with directv expired and we discontinued our prosync product offering on directv 
the fees we derived from prosync enabled set top boxes deployed in directv s network  such as fees from advertising  programming and licensing relationships  were approximately million in license fees 
we derive license fees from the licensing of products such as device mosaic  opentv streamer  opentv software developers kit and various applications 
due to a slowdown in interactive television related spending by network operators for the launch and expansion of their networks  we experienced a significant decline in license fees in and in order to reverse this declining trend  we will need to either license our software to new customers or sell additional licenses to existing customers 
license fees for the year ended december  were million  a decline of million  or  from million in license fees for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in liberty media affiliates accounted for million of license fees in and million in mih and its related entities accounted for million of license fees in and million in motorola accounted for million of license fees in echostar accounted for million of license fees in 
table of contents operating expenses our total operating expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and billion for the year ended december  excluding charges for impairment and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and charges for restructuring costs  all as described in more detail below  our operating expenses would have been million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the acquisition of wink in accounted for million of operating expenses for the year ended december  and million of operating expenses for the year ended december  the acquisitions of actv and the bettingcorp assets in accounted for million of operating expenses for the year ended december  the significant reduction in expenses in was attributable to the restructuring actions taken in and early we expect our total operating expenses for to be lower than  assuming no material changes to our business or significant changes necessary to reflect additional customer commitments

cost of revenues consist primarily of compensation related expenses and related overhead costs associated with professional services engagements  network infrastructure and bandwidth costs of our interactive games and betting channels  and amortization of developed technology 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues were in compared with in the primary reason for the decrease was the restructuring actions taken in and early there was also a decrease of million relating to a contract termination cost that did not recur in in addition  there was a decrease of million in amortization of share based compensation for certain options that were cancelled or became fully vested during these reductions more than offset the increase of million of expenses incurred from the acquisition of wink and the million of expenses incurred from the acquisitions of actv and the bettingcorp assets 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  cost of revenues were in compared with in the primary reason for the increase was million of costs related to the growth of the playjam business and the inclusion of playjam for twelve months in compared with six months in in addition  there were million of costs associated with wink  which was acquired in  million for estimated contract termination costs  and million for additional amortization of developed technology 
these increases were offset by decreases of million due to reduced staffing  consultants  travel and overhead costs for the professional services group as a result of the reduced volume of engagements  
table of contents million in bonus compensation  and million in share based compensation for certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested during research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses and related overhead costs incurred for both new product development and enhancements to our range of software and application products 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in compared with in the primary reason for the decrease was the restructuring actions taken in and early this decrease more than offset the increase of million from the acquisitions of actv and the bettingcorp assets 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in compared with in the primary reason for the decrease was reduced staffing  travel and overhead costs of million coupled with a decrease of million in bonus compensation  and a decrease of million due to lower share based compensation for certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested 
the results for included a provision of million for in process research and development associated with the acquisition of spyglass 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million  including million of in process research and development costs resulting from the acquisition of wink and an increase of million resulting from static being included in the results for the full year 
we believe that research and development spending is critical to remain competitive in the marketplace 
we will continue to focus on the timely development of new and enhanced interactive television products for our customers  and we plan to continue investing at levels that are adequate to develop our technologies and product offerings 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses and related overhead costs  and travel costs 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in compared with in as part of the restructuring actions taken in and early  discretionary marketing spending was reduced 
in addition  as a result of the cancellation of the agreement with directv in december  we reversed a million accrual that we had made for development funds which were no longer due to directv 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were in compared with in expenses attributable to our advertising  trade show  branding and other discretionary marketing programs decreased by million as we reduced expenses in response to the significant decrease in total revenues 
furthermore  expenses decreased by million due to reduced staffing  overhead and travel  million due to lower sales commissions and bonus compensation  and million due to lower share based compensation for certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested in these decreases were offset by an increase of million attributable to the acquisition of wink and million resulting from static being included in the results for a full year

table of contents certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested during  and a decrease of million in retention payments for certain key management personnel 
these decreases more than offset the increase in general and administrative expenses of million from the acquisitions of actv and the bettingcorp assets 
commencing in august  liberty broadband interactive television  inc  or liberty broadband  a wholly owned subsidiary of liberty media  provided management services for us 
we reimbursed them for the services based on the estimated percentage of time that various individuals employed by liberty broadband dedicated to the performance of services for us 
in addition  we also reimbursed them for an allocated portion of their administrative costs 
for the year ended december   total management charges from liberty broadband for compensation and general administrative costs were million 
in february  our management relationship with liberty broadband was terminated  which we expect to help reduce our general and administrative expenses in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million from million in as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in compared with in the increase included million from the inclusion of four months of operating results of wink  and million from the inclusion of static s operating results for a full year in in addition  the results include million for retention payments to certain key management personnel with no comparable expense in and an increase of million in the provision for doubtful accounts 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million due to lower share based compensation for certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested and lower bonus compensation 
restructuring costs 
during and  we took several initiatives to reduce operating expenses around the world 
as a result of these actions  headcount was reduced by employees in and approximately employees in provision was also made for excess office space and the write down of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment that was abandoned 
these initiatives resulted in total restructuring costs of million in and million in impairment and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
in july  we acquired spyglass  which resulted in approximately billion of goodwill 
at december   we recorded an impairment of million against the carrying value of goodwill as a result of our cash flow projections that indicated that the future cash flows were not sufficient to result in the recovery of the carrying value of our fixed and intangible assets 
in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we re evaluated the amount recorded as goodwill as of january  and determined that a transitional impairment of million had occurred 
this amount has been shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the third quarter of  due to reductions by network operators in their capital spending and rollout of interactive television related products and similar reductions by other customers  we revised our cash flow projections for the remainder of calendar year and future years 
based on these cash flow projections and other factors  including the decline in the market price of our class a ordinary shares  we determined that the remaining goodwill was impaired  and accordingly  wrote off the balance of million 
as a result of new accounting rules for goodwill  there was no amortization required in  whereas the amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december  in the third quarter of  we determined that an impairment of million had occurred in the value of the patents related to our openstar joint venture with echostar due to the absence of any current or future expected cash flow generated by the joint venture 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined than an impairment of million had occurred in the value of patents related to our acquisition of cablesoft due to the absence of any current or future expected cash flow associated with the cablesoft technologies 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated benefit periods of to years 
amortization of developed technologies was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as cost of revenues 
amortization of other intangible assets was million for the year ended december   million 
table of contents for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in amortization expense for compared to was due primarily to the expiration of the amortization of certain spyglass intangibles that had an amortization period of three years 
the decrease of million in amortization expense for compared to was due primarily to the impairment of the patents related to the openstar joint venture and the expiration of the amortization of certain spyglass intangibles that had an amortization period of years 
interest income as a result of declining interest rates in the united states coupled with decreases in our investment portfolio resulting from the sale of investment securities both to support our operations and to finance our acquisitions of wink in and actv and the bettingcorp assets in  interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  other income and expense items historically we made various equity investments in  and loans to  certain privately held companies 
most of these companies subsequently experienced severe cash flow problems  and we found it necessary to write down the value of our private equity investments 
for the year ended december   we wrote down the remaining balance of million of such private equity investments and our share of losses of private equity investee was million 
for the year ended december   there was a write down of private equity investments of million 
as a result of the acquisition of spyglass in july  we acquired certain marketable equity securities 
these securities were sold for realized losses of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december  other expense was million  which included million for the settlement of fees due under an investment banking arrangement 
minority interest in november  we established spyglass integration  inc  a co owned venture with motorola 
due to the losses of this venture  we recorded minority interest income of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  income taxes we have significant united states federal tax loss carryforwards 
however  we are subject to income taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and we have foreign taxes withheld from certain royalty payments 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   there was a net income tax benefit of million  which was comprised of a current tax provision of million offset by a deferred tax credit of million resulting from the fair value calculations for the aforementioned marketable equity securities acquired in connection with our acquisition of spyglass and which were subsequently sold 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to be able to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months by using existing cash balances and short term and long term marketable debt securities  if our assumptions about our revenues  expenses and cash commitments are generally accurate 
because we cannot be certain that our assumptions about our business or the interactive television market in general will prove to be accurate  our capital requirements may differ from our current expectations 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which was an increase of million from the prior year 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
taking into account short term and long term marketable debt securities of million  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of

one customer accounted for of net accounts receivable as of december  the primary uses of cash are payroll  general operating expenses and cost of revenues 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the increases in cash uses were due primarily to our continuing operating losses  including restructuring payments 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december   due primarily to the sale of marketable debt securities 
uses of cash included million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the sale of marketable debt securities to finance the acquisition of wink 
uses of cash included million for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and million for capital expenditures

uses of cash included million for the acquisition of static and million for capital expenditures  offset by million from the sale of marketable equity securities and million net from a decrease in marketable debt securities and other items 
cash provided from financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options and a capital contribution to fund management retention payments from our former controlling stockholder  mih limited 
for the year ended december   cash provided from financing activities was million due to proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares and a capital contribution from mih limited 
for the year ended december   cash provided from financing activities was million due to the exercise of warrants and stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
we use professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
the portfolio consists of highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities of the united states government and agencies  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit that predominantly have maturities of less than three years 
all investments are made according to our investment policy  which has been approved by our board of directors 
commitments and contractual obligations information as of december  concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations is summarized below in millions less than over total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business we enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for bandwidth  marketing  and other services 
minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million  million and million for the years ending december    and  respectively 
in addition  we have a variable commitment with a cable provider that is based on households that receive our prosync service 
based on current expectations  we believe that this commitment may aggregate up to approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we had two standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued to landlords at two of our leased properties and we had million of marketable debt securities pledged with a bank for foreign exchange facilities 
in march  we entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with sun microsystems  inc under which sun microsystems granted us a non exclusive  non transferable license to develop and distribute 
table of contents products based upon sun microsystems s java technology 
subsequent amendments extended our license through december as amended  the agreement requires us to make a payment of million to sun microsystems in february  less any amounts previously paid for support and royalty fees  which have been nominal to date 
indemnifications in the normal course of our business  we provide indemnification to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations  although our liabilities in those arrangements are customarily limited in various respects  including monetarily 
as permitted under the laws of the british virgin islands  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is not material

the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following factors in evaluating opentv and our business 
we have a history of net losses  and we may continue to experience net losses in the future 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
our net loss for the years ended december   and was approximately  million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and administrative expenses and expect to continue to suffer net losses in the near term 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve  sustain or increase profitability in the future 
any failure to significantly increase revenue as we implement our product and distribution strategies would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have historically derived a significant percentage of our revenues from licensing our core middleware product to network operators 
our opportunities for future revenue growth with that product  especially outside of the united states  may be limited 
we have on a historic basis derived a significant percentage of our total revenues from royalties associated with the deployment of our core middleware and fees charged for services rendered in support of our middleware deployments 
only a limited number of network operators worldwide currently deploy interactive products and services in a meaningful way 
while we continue to seek deployments within the united states  
table of contents we have a significant number of customers outside of the united states that have deployed our core middleware 
in most cases  the number of network operators in any particular country is relatively small  and to the extent that we have already achieved deployments in those countries  the opportunities for future growth of our middleware business may be limited 
accordingly  our ability to generate significant additional core middleware related revenues from customers outside of the united states may be limited 
in addition  to meet the different needs of our customers  we have deployed multiple versions of our core middleware platform to network operators around the world 
maintaining and supporting multiple platforms concurrently is expensive because it requires us to devote significant resources  including engineering and technical support  to older platforms that may not have significant distribution 
we intend  over time  to migrate our network operator customers to a standard middleware platform in order to reduce our costs 
however  it is difficult to predict the timing of network upgrades by operators  and when they do decide to upgrade  there can be no guarantee that they will choose to license our standard middleware platform or require certain customization 
our capacity to generate future revenues associated with our core middleware may also be limited due to a number of reasons  including network operators that have selected our core middleware may switch to another middleware platform for the provision of interactive services  reduce their pace of set top box deployment or stop deploying set top boxes enabled with our core middleware  decrease or stop their use of our support services  or choose not to upgrade or add additional features to the version of our core middleware running on their networks  network operators that have not selected our core middleware may choose another middleware platform for the provision of interactive services  or a meaningful opportunity to deploy our core middleware in the markets that have not yet adopted interactive television on a large scale may never develop or may develop at a very slow pace 
any of these eventualities would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect a more significant portion of our revenue growth in the future to be derived from interactive content and applications that we develop and market 
if we are not successful in developing and marketing that interactive content and those applications  our future revenue growth may be limited 
we expect over the next several years to develop extensive interactive content and applications  including gaming channels  addressable and targeted advertising and programming synchronous applications 
the market for interactive content and applications is still nascent and evolving 
historically  we have derived only a relatively small percentage of our total revenue from these offerings 
we cannot be certain that the demand for or the market acceptance of interactive content and applications will develop as we anticipate  and even if they do  we cannot be certain that we will be able to market that content and those applications effectively and successfully respond to changes in consumer preferences 
in addition  our ability to market those products will be affected to a large degree by network operators 
if network operators determine that our interactive content and applications do not meet their business or operational expectations  the operators may choose not to offer our applications to their customers 
to the extent that network operators fail to renew or enter into new or expanded contracts with us for provision of interactive content such as our enhanced interactive television service and applications such as the playjam channel  we will be unable to maintain or increase the level of distribution of our interactive content and applications and the associated revenue from those offerings 
moreover  due to global economic conditions  network operators may slow down their deployment of new content and applications offerings  and such actions would negatively impact our revenue 
accordingly  our ability to generate substantial revenues from our interactive content and applications offerings is uncertain 

table of contents we may seek to generate a significantly greater percentage of our revenue growth in the future from revenue sharing and subscription based arrangements 
if we are unsuccessful in developing those revenue models  then our future revenue growth may be limited and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
we have historically generated a substantial portion of our revenue from royalty and licensing fees related to the licensing of our core middleware products and from fees for professional services that we provide 
we believe that our capacity to generate future revenues in this manner may be limited  and if we are unsuccessful in evolving our revenue model  our opportunities for future revenue growth  particularly outside of the united states  may be limited 
we expect  over time  that we may need to seek an increasing percentage of our revenues from revenue sharing arrangements with network operators  programmers and advertisers 
in those instances  we would typically receive a percentage of the payments that a network operator  programmer or advertiser may receive from transactions that make use of our interactive content or applications 
we also expect  over time  that we may need to seek an increasing percentage of our revenues from subscription based fee arrangements 
in those instances  we would typically receive a fixed payment  over a period of time  based on the number of subscribers or viewers that use or access our technologies  content or applications 
there can no guarantee that we will be successful in entering into future revenue sharing or subscription based arrangements with network operators  programmers or advertisers or that we will be able to generate a substantial amount of revenue from these sources 
if our efforts are unsuccessful  then our future results of operations will be adversely affected 
we have acquired several businesses since october we continue to implement initiatives designed to enhance the integration of those businesses and to seek further consolidation of our worldwide operations 
our failure to effectively integrate those acquired businesses  or to streamline our operations  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we acquired wink communications  inc  a provider of interactive and enhanced television services  in october we acquired actv  inc  a provider of addressable advertising and related products and services  in july in addition  in august  we acquired substantially all of the assets of bettingcorp limited  a provider of gaming and gambling technologies and services 
we face many risks and challenges associated with integrating these acquisitions  including difficulties related to the integration of operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing business  especially outside the united states as with bettingcorp  diversion of management s attention from our business  incorporation of acquired products and business technology into our existing product lines  and adoption and maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies 
while we believe that we have made progress in integrating those businesses  and their personnel and technologies  with ours  we have not completed those efforts 
if we are not successful in integrating those businesses with ours  we may not realize the full benefits of the assets that we acquired 
moreover  if we do not successfully complete such integration and consolidation in a timely manner  the increased demands on management s time  and the increased costs associated with that process may also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to pursue restructuring initiatives that we initiated in while we have accomplished many of the objectives we established for that process  we continue to seek to align our resources appropriately as our business evolves 
that ongoing process may result in unanticipated consequences and may not be as successful in reducing expenses as we had anticipated 
in addition to the integration and consolidation efforts that we have undertaken in response to our various acquisitions  we began to implement several restructuring initiatives in in an effort to streamline our worldwide operations and reduce our operating expenses 
in this regard  we continue to undertake efforts to consolidate our operations  close and relocate various offices around the world  divest non strategic assets and reduce our headcount 
these initiatives may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our 
table of contents planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and diminished performance 
reductions in personnel  both anticipated and unanticipated  could materially and adversely impact our sales and marketing efforts  research and development efforts  and our professional services and general and administrative functions 
in conjunction with these restructuring initiatives  we have engaged and are continuing to engage in a review of our operations with a view towards improving our business performance 
there is a risk that  as new business strategies and administrative processes are developed and implemented  the changes we adopt will be unduly disruptive or less effective than our old strategies and processes 
this may adversely affect our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we may be unable in the future to raise additional capital required to support our operating activities 
we expect that our capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
nevertheless  we have incurred to date and we expect that we will continue to incur in the future significant expenses  many of which result from non cancelable operating commitments 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
we used approximately million in cash for operating activities during the fiscal year ended december  and million during the fiscal year ended december  we may need to raise additional capital in the future if our revenue growth does not meet our expectations or we are unable to reduce substantially the amount of cash used in our operating activities 
while we continue to monitor our operating expenses and seek to bring them in line with our revenues  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
to the extent we are required to raise additional capital  we may not be able to do so at all or we may be able to do so only on unacceptable terms 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or future prospects 
the market for our products and services is subject to significant competition  which could adversely affect our business 
we face competition from a number of companies  including many that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and a better recognized brand name than we do 
current and potential competitors in one or more aspects of our business include interactive technology companies  companies developing interactive television content and entertainment  and  in the professional services area  third party system integrators and internal information technology staffs at our network operator customers 
some of our customers or their affiliates offer products or services that compete with our products and services 
for example  in addition to our playjam and playmontecarlo applications  british sky broadcasting also offers its own competitive gaming and gambling applications through its broadcast network 
if any of these competitors achieves significant market penetration or other significant success within the markets upon which we rely as a significant source of revenue  or in new markets that we may enter in the future  our ability to maintain market share and sustain our revenues may be materially and adversely affected 
the trend of consolidation among industry participants may adversely impact our business  results of operations and future prospects 
there has been a worldwide trend of consolidation in the cable and direct broadcast satellite industries 
we believe this trend is likely to continue due to economic and competitive concerns 
this trend appears to be expanding to include other companies involved with the interactive television industry 
for example  the news corporation ltd 
recently completed its acquisition of a controlling stake in hughes electronics  the parent of directv  and nds group plc  an affiliate of news corporation  recently completed its acquisition of the mediahighway interactive television business from thomson 
while the full impact of this trend is uncertain at the present time  we will need to adapt to changing relationships with industry participants and address competitive concerns that may arise as companies consolidate 
if we are unable to successfully 
table of contents manage these changing relationships and address these competitive concerns  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts  the trading price of our class a ordinary shares could be negatively affected 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and they may vary substantially in the future depending upon a number of factors described below  including many that are beyond our control 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the rate of capital spending and the rollout of interactive television related products and services by network operators  the number  size and scope of network operators deploying opentv enabled interactive services and the associated rollout to subscribers  increased competition in general and any changes in our pricing policies that may result from increased competitive pressures  potential downturns in our customers businesses or in the domestic or international markets for our products and services  the ability to generate applications related revenue from existing and potential customers  changes in technology  whether or not developed by us  our ability to develop and introduce on a timely basis new or enhanced versions of our products that can compete favorably in the marketplace  and the timing of revenue recognition associated with major licensing and services agreements 
because a high percentage of our expenses  particularly compensation  is fixed in advance of any particular quarter  any of the factors listed above could cause significant variations in our earnings on a quarter to quarter basis 
you should not rely on the results of prior periods as an indication of our future performance 
any decline in revenues or a greater than expected loss for any quarter could cause the market price of our class a ordinary shares to decline 
a significant portion of our senior management team is new 
if they are unable to work together effectively  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
our business is highly dependent on the ability of our senior management team to work together effectively to execute our business plan 
our management team has changed significantly over the past several months 
in december  michael zeisser assumed the role of interim chairman of our board of directors 
in addition  our chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel and several other senior executives in important operational roles joined us in the last half of these individuals and our existing management team have not previously worked together 
if they are unable to effectively integrate themselves into our business or work together as a management team  we may not be able to manage our business effectively 
we depend upon key technical  consulting and support personnel to operate our business  and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel 
our business requires highly trained technical  consulting and support personnel to assist customers with launch and deployment of our products 
in the future  we may need to increase our technical  consulting and support staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
notwithstanding the 
table of contents current economic climate  hiring consulting and support personnel has remained very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the interactive television market  and we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel in the past 
even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain these qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts  which may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
interactive television remains an emerging business and it may not attract widespread market acceptance or demand 
our success will depend upon  among other things  the broad acceptance of interactive television by industry participants  including operators of broadcast and pay television networks  network operators and manufacturers of televisions and set top boxes  as well as by television viewers and advertisers 
because the market for interactive television remains an emerging market  the potential size of the market opportunity and the timing of its development are uncertain 
the growth and future success of our business will depend in part upon our ability to penetrate new markets and convince network operators  television viewers and advertisers to adopt and maintain their use of our products and services 
because much of our success and value lie in our ownership and use of our intellectual property  our failure to protect our intellectual property and develop new proprietary technology may negatively affect us 
our ability to effectively conduct our business will be dependent in part upon the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our rights in and to our technology 
we have typically entered into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  customers  strategic partners and vendors  in an effort to control access to  and distribution of  our software  related documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other proprietary information without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of our software and proprietary information will be difficult 
the steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property and the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable in some instances 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries or  alternatively  such protection may be difficult to enforce 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our intellectual property rights and the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and diversion of resources  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against us  which could have the effect of disrupting our business 
we may be the subject of claims by third parties alleging that we infringe their intellectual property 
the defense of any such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could result in the diversion of resources with respect to the defense of any claims brought  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of such infringement claims  a court could issue an injunction preventing us from distributing certain products  which could adversely affect our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights in order to avoid any litigation 
however  a license under such circumstances may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 

table of contents we grant certain indemnification rights to our customers when we license our software technologies 
we may  therefore  become subject to third party infringement claims through those commercial arrangements 
in addition  the damages to which we are subject may be increased by the use of our technologies in our customers products 
many of wink communications  actv s and our agreements with customers contain an indemnification obligation  which could be triggered in the event that a customer is named in an infringement suit involving their products or involving the customer s products or services that incorporate or use their products 
if it is determined that our products infringe any of the asserted claims in such a suit  we may be prevented from distributing certain of our products and we may incur significant indemnification liabilities  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  while damages claims in respect of an alleged infringement may  in many cases  be based upon a presumed royalty rate that the patent holder would have otherwise been entitled to  it is possible that our liability may increase as a result of the incorporation of our technology with our customer s products 
in some cases  potential damages against us could be based on the profits derived from a product that infringes through the use of our software even though we receive a relatively moderate economic benefit from the licensing arrangement 
the adoption of incompatible standards by our industry and rapid technological advances could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the migration of television from analog to digital transmission  the convergence of television  the internet  communications and other media  and other emerging trends  such as the deployment of high definition television and multicasting  are creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment in which to operate 
our ability to anticipate trends and adapt to new technologies and evolving standards is critical to our success 
recent attempts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include an initiative by cable network operators in the united states to create a uniform platform for interactive television called open cable and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a platform called multimedia home platform 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products or services to respond to these developments  or otherwise hurt our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
the deployment of new digital television applications  such as high definition television and multicasting multiple television programs through a single channel  may compete directly with our products and services for broadcast distribution capacity 
to the extent that such capacity cannot accommodate all of the applications that a cable or direct broadcast satellite system operator wants to distribute  then there is a risk that other applications will be deployed to the exclusion of our content and applications 
if this occurs  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we must stay abreast of cutting edge technological developments and evolving service offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of our services  and we must be able to incorporate new technologies into our products in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully  and any failure to do so may adversely affect us 

table of contents government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  the online distribution of content and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
in particular  governmental laws or regulations restricting or burdening the exchange of personally identifiable information could delay the implementation of interactive services or create liability for us or any other manufacturer of software that facilitates information exchange 
these governmental agencies may also seek to regulate interactive television directly 
future developments relating to any of these regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
through the use of our technology  we have the ability to collect personal and confidential information from set top boxes 
if we fail to protect this information from security breaches or misuse this information  then our operations could be disrupted and we could be subject to litigation and liability under privacy laws 
through the technology that we license for use in set top boxes  we have the ability  when requested by our customers  to collect and store personal information from users of our applications 
subject to applicable laws  and the agreement of our customers and consumers  we may also seek to use such information to help develop addressable and targeted advertising businesses 
storage and use of such information is subject to state and federal regulation and may also subject us to privacy claims relating to its use and dissemination 
in addition  a third party might be able to breach our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our servers where such information is stored and misappropriate such information or cause interruptions to our business operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to monitor the laws applicable to privacy matters  to protect against security breaches or to deal with the consequences of any breach 
a breach of privacy rights by us  network operators or other third parties could expose us to liability 
any compromise of security or misuse of private information could materially and adversely affect our business  reputation  operating results and financial condition and expose us to costly litigation and regulatory action 
concerns over the security of personal information transmitted through our applications and the potential misuse of such information might also inhibit market acceptance of our applications  and if this occurs  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
there are many regulations and restrictions that affect gaming and gambling activities throughout the world 
as we develop and seek to market gaming and gambling applications  we must assess the legality of these types of activities in different jurisdictions 
our inability to legally launch these applications  the uncertain regulatory landscape for these applications and the significant costs associated with ongoing evaluations regarding the state of gaming and gambling laws around the world may adversely affect our business 
we expect to develop and market gaming and gambling applications for interactive television based on technologies and know how that we acquired through bettingcorp 
in many jurisdictions throughout the world  the laws regulating gaming and gambling  particularly through media such as interactive television and the internet  are highly uncertain and subject to frequent change 
the penalties in many jurisdictions include both civil and criminal penalties 
while we continually assess the laws and regulations regarding gaming and gambling ventures  and engage special outside legal counsel to assist in that process  we cannot be certain that our interpretation of  or the advice that we receive from outside professionals with respect to  those laws will necessarily be the only possible interpretation 
the costs associated with that evaluative process are not  and will not be  insignificant 
in the event  that we are incorrect in our interpretation of certain laws or regulations  we may be subject to penalties 
moreover  we may be required to make significant changes to our business  if those laws or regulations change in ways that we do not anticipate or expect 
the uncertainty inherent in these matters  the changing nature of these laws and regulations  and the significant costs associated with our ongoing evaluation of those laws and regulations  may adversely affect our business over time 
if we do not believe that we can legally and effectively launch gaming and gambling applications  our future growth may be impaired 

table of contents our multinational operations expose us to special risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results and require increased time and attention of management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from customers located outside of the united states and have significant operations in a number of countries around the world 
our international operations are subject to special risks  including differing legal and regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements  potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy  misappropriation or weaker laws regarding intellectual property protection  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  currency fluctuations and devaluations  difficulties in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  language and cultural differences  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our software products may contain errors  which could cause us to lose revenue and incur unexpected expenses 
software development is an inherently complex and subjective process  which frequently results in products that contain errors  as well as defective features and functions 
moreover  our technology is integrated into the products and services of our network operator customers 
accordingly  a defect  error or performance problem with our technology could cause the systems of our network operator customers to fail for a period of time or to be impaired in certain respects 
any such failure could subject us to damage claims and claims for indemnification by our customers and result in severe customer relations problems and harm to our reputation 
while our agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit or exclude our exposure to potential liability claims in those circumstances  those provisions may not be effective  in all respects  under the laws of some jurisdictions 
as a result  we could be required to pay substantial amounts of damages in settlement or upon the determination of any of these types of claims 
the interests of our majority owner may differ from yours and may result in opentv acting in a manner inconsistent with your general interests 
liberty media corporation beneficially owns our class a and class b ordinary shares representing approximately of the economic interest and of the voting power of our ordinary shares outstanding as of december  as a result of its ownership of our ordinary shares  liberty media has sufficient voting power  without the vote of any other stockholder  to determine the outcome of any action presented to a vote of our stockholders  including amendments of our memorandum of association and articles of association for any purpose which could include increasing or reducing our authorized capital or authorizing the issuance of additional shares 
the interests of liberty media may diverge from your interests  and liberty media may be in a position to cause or require us to act in a way that is inconsistent with the general interests of the holders of our class a ordinary shares 

table of contents because we are controlled by liberty media  we are exempt from certain listing requirements of the nasdaq national market relating to corporate governance matters 
over the past several years  the national association of securities dealers has adopted certain listing requirements for the nasdaq national market system designed to enhance corporate governance standards of the companies who are listed thereon 
as a result of liberty media s beneficial ownership of our class a and class b ordinary shares  we are not subject to some of these requirements  including the requirement that a majority of our board of directors be independent under the guidelines established by the national association of securities dealers and certain requirements regarding the determination of our chief executive officer s compensation and our director nominees 
while we do not believe that our exemption from those requirements affects the manner and method by which we manage and operate the company  investors should be aware that we are not subject to those provisions and may have no obligation to comply with those requirements in the future unless our ownership profile changes 
because we are a british virgin islands company  you may not be able to enforce judgments against us that are obtained in united states courts 
we are incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process upon us within the united states or to enforce against us judgments obtained in the united states courts  including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
we have been advised by our british virgin islands counsel  harney westwood riegels  that judgments of united states courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states may be difficult to enforce in british virgin islands courts and that there is doubt as to whether british virgin islands courts will enter judgments in original actions brought in british virgin islands courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
because we are a british virgin islands company  your rights as a stockholder may be less clearly established as compared to the rights of stockholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum of association and articles of association and by the international business companies act of the british virgin islands 
principles of law relating to such matters as the validity of corporate procedures  the fiduciary duties of management and the rights of our stockholders may differ from those that would apply if we were incorporated in the united states or another jurisdiction 
the rights of stockholders under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as are the rights of stockholders in many other jurisdictions 
thus  our stockholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests in the face of actions by our board of directors or our controlling stockholder than they would have as stockholders of a corporation incorporated in another jurisdiction 
certain provisions contained in our charter documents could deter a change of control of us 
certain provisions of our memorandum of association and articles of association may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire or merge with us  which could reduce the market value of our class a ordinary shares 
the comparatively low voting rights of our class a ordinary shares as compared to our class b ordinary shares  approximately of which are beneficially owned by liberty media as of december   as well as other provisions of our memorandum of association and articles of association  may delay  deter or prevent other persons from attempting to acquire control of us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities  investments in privately held companies and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income 
most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands valuation of valuation of valuation of securities if securities if securities if interest rates fair value as interest rates interest rates issuer decrease of increase increase united states government and agencies state and local governments in the united states corporate notes and bonds non united states government certificate of deposit total the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuers of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
a majority of our worldwide customers are invoiced and make payments in united states dollars 
a minority of our worldwide customers are invoiced by our non united states business units under contracts that require payments to be remitted in local currency 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we regularly assess foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations 
we did not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or options in hedging foreign currency exposures during there were no foreign exchange forward contracts or other procedures implemented to hedge foreign currency exposures outstanding as of december
