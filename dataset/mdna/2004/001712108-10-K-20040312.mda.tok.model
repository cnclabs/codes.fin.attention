item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results please see part i  item above for an important discussion about forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect future results 
overview vitalworks inc is a leading provider of information and image management technology and services targeted to healthcare practices and organizations throughout the united states 
we provide it based  specialty specific solutions for imaging centers and hospital radiology departments  and medical practices specializing in anesthesiology  ophthalmology  emergency medicine  plastic surgery  dermatology  and internal medicine 
we also offer enterprise level systems designed for large physician groups and networks 
our range of software solutions provide image management  workflow management  and information management related to administrative  financial  and clinical functions for physicians  radiologists and other healthcare providers 
we provide our clients with ongoing software support  implementation  training  and electronic data interchange  or edi  services for patient billing and claims processing 
software license fees and system revenues are derived from the sale of software product licenses and computer hardware 
maintenance and services revenues come from providing ongoing product support  implementation  training and transaction processing services 
approximately of our total revenues were of a recurring nature in and in and  approximately of our total revenues were derived from the medical practices market and from the radiology market 
results of operations on november   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of amicas  inc  a developer of web based diagnostic image management software solutions  for million in cash  including direct transaction costs 
commonly referred to in the marketplace as pacs picture archiving and communication systems  these software solutions allow radiologists and other physicians to examine  store  and distribute digitized medical images 
we financed million of the purchase price through the use of our credit line 
the merger agreement provides for an additional purchase payment of up to million based on attainment of specified earnings targets through which  if paid  would be recognized as additional goodwill 
in addition  we assumed incentive plans for certain management employees of amicas that provide for up to million of compensation  tied to the attainment of the earnings targets for the contingent earn out period 
the addition of amicas provides us with the ability to offer radiology imaging center clients a comprehensive  integrated information and image management solution  incorporating the key components of a complete radiology data management system 
our results of operations include only one month of operating results of amicas 
for the month of december  amicas had total revenues of 
million  and a net loss of million which included a 
million charge for acquired in process technology  and depreciation and amortization expense of 
million 
revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services    percentage of total revenues software licenses and system sales    percentage of total revenues we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
training  implementation and edi services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the relative fair values of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and or maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
the fair value of an element is determined by the average price charged when that element is sold separately eg  the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on the average renewal price charged to clients for continued maintenance 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until objective evidence of fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
in the december quarter  we entered into certain contracts that include customer acceptance provisions 
these orders for products and services were derived from the high end of our markets 
we provide allowances for estimated future returns and discounts recorded as contra revenue  as well as bad debts  upon recognition of revenues 
recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
if we were to adopt new  or change our current  business practices in response to a preference from the market or otherwise  then our revenue recognition practices may be subject to significant change to comply with the requisite accounting principles 
for example  subscription type arrangements and practices strictly for software services and support would result in the recognition of revenues ratably over the term of the arrangement 
the increase in maintenance and services revenues in is mainly attributable to an increase in hipaa compliance implementation and training services revenues of million 
this increase was partially offset by declines in maintenance revenues of approximately million relating to net customer attrition  implementation and training services revenues of 
million relating to product sales that were down in  and the loss of rental revenue of 
million due to the sale of our former headquarters building in august the hipaa service revenues relate to the government s october compliance deadline regarding its electronic processing standards for most healthcare transactions among physicians  payors  patients and other healthcare industry participants 
accordingly  for the most part  these hipaa related services are no longer required 
excluding edi services revenues of million recognized in in connection with the settlement of a contract dispute with an edi supplier  maintenance and services revenues in increased million 
the increase is primarily attributable to i an increase in training and implementation services revenues of million  corresponding to the favorable trend in sales of software licenses and systems  and ii additional edi revenues  net of customer attrition  of approximately million  which reflect the conversion of a number of customer accounts to direct billing by us for printing services performed by certain third parties that  in the first nine months of  had been billed directly by the printing vendors 
our revised agreements with these printers now call for us to bill our physician practices directly for printing services and  in turn  remit a specified dollar amount per page to the printer 
accordingly  based on the amended agreements  we recognize of our direct billings as revenue  compared to an amount that previously was net of the printers fees 
moreover  the increases were partly offset by i the loss of revenues totaling million earned in under agreements to promote third party product and services  which agreements were terminated in  and ii a 
million decline in maintenance revenues related to net customer attrition 
software license and system revenues declined in primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of license and systems sold unit volume versus  for example  price decreases  particularly software products marketed to large physician group practices 
the decline was partially offset by an increase in software and system sales into the small group market of 
million 
we operate with a minimal amount of software licensing and system sales backlog 
therefore  quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of the signing of license agreements and product deliveries during each quarter  which are very difficult to forecast 
a significant portion of our quarterly sales of software product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter  generally with a concentration of our quarterly revenues earned in the final ten business days of that month 
also  our projections for revenues and operating results include significant sales of new product and service offerings  including our new image management systems  amicas r vision series pacs  our new radiology information system  radconnect r ris  and our intuition tm product line of practice management and electronic medical records systems  which may not be realized 
due to these and other factors  our revenues and operating results are very difficult to forecast 
as a result  comparison of our period to period financial performance is not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
moreover  if new software sales do not materialize  our maintenance and edi services revenues can be expected to decrease over time due to the combined effects of attrition of existing clients and a shortfall in new client additions 
in  software license and system revenues rose primarily due to an increase in the number of licenses and systems sold 
this increase was led by software sales made primarily to ambulatory imaging centers and radiology practices 
cost of revenues year ended december  change change dollars in thousands maintenance and services    percentage of maintenance and services revenues software licenses and system sales    percentage of software licenses and system sales cost of maintenance and services revenues consists primarily of the cost of edi insurance claims processing  outsourced hardware maintenance and edi billing and statement printing services  and postage 
the increase in principally reflects the additional use of third parties for implementation and training services 
the increase in the cost of maintenance and services revenues in primarily reflects additional costs of edi services incurred in connection with the conversion of a number of customers to direct billing for printing services  as discussed above regarding edi revenues 
in addition  in we recovered certain edi processing costs and recognized a credit of 
million in connection with the contract settlement referred to above 
cost of software license and system revenues consists primarily of costs incurred to purchase computer hardware  third party software and other items for resale in connection with sales of new systems and software and  beginning in  amortization of software product costs 
the increase in is largely attributable to an increase in amortization of software costs of million and 
million of additional software royalties 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in computer hardware costs of 
million due to a decline in computer hardware sales 
in  we anticipate approximately million of amortization relating to software product assets from the acquisition of amicas 
in  the increase in the cost of software license and systems revenues is mainly attributable to million in additional costs associated with an increase in the number of computer hardware units sold  and amortization of software product costs of 
million 
operating expenses year ended december  change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues research and development    percentage of total revenues depreciation and amortization    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include fixed and variable compensation and benefits of all personnel other than research and development personnel  facilities  travel  communications  bad debt  legal  marketing  insurance and other administrative expenses 
the increase in is primarily due to an increase in fixed compensation expense of million 
million from amicas  as well as additional costs and expenses for marketing of 
million 
million from amicas  for legal  travel  temporary staff and software maintenance of 
million each  and charges of 
million relating to merger and acquisition initiatives 
the increase in fixed compensation is mainly due to an increase in our employee base 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in variable compensation of million and bad debt expense of million 
moreover  includes a credit of 
million that reflects the favorable resolution of an outstanding matter involving a federally subsidized research and development project dating back to the credit was recognized through the reduction of certain accrued liabilities 
in  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was related to the savings that resulted from a major restructuring plan that we initiated in august we closed offices  the last five of which were closed in march and april  and our employee base average was reduced to for  from for and for the decrease in also reflects declines in legal fees of million  bad debt expense of 
million and contract labor costs of 
million 
the increase in research and development expenses is mainly attributable to additional personnel costs associated with our expanded research and development activities  and additional third party software developer fees 
in addition  for  and  we capitalized million  million  and million or  and of total research and development expenditures of third party programmer fees  respectively  in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
the amounts capitalized relate to our development of web based applications  including an enterprise wide electronic medical records system and a radiology information system  or ris  which is a workflow solution for medical imaging centers 
we amortize capitalized software development costs over the estimated economic life of the products 
depending on the nature and success of the product  we generally expect to amortize these deferred costs over a three to five year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
two products under development were made commercially available in no additional products were made commercially available in we expect three new products to become commercially available by the end of the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in reflects the fact that certain assets became fully depreciated in the decline in was due primarily to the cessation of goodwill amortization in conformity with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  which provides that  upon adoption  we shall no longer amortize our goodwill assets 
rather  we are required to test these assets for impairment of value on at least an annual basis 
to date  the results of our tests have not revealed an impairment of value 
pursuant to statement  we discontinued amortizing goodwill on january  in  depreciation and amortization expense consisted mainly of million of goodwill amortization 
in  we anticipate approximately 
million of depreciation and amortization relating to certain intangible assets  and property and equipment from the acquisition of amicas 
acquired in process technology 
in connection with the acquisition of amicas  
million of the purchase price was allocated to acquired in process technology based upon an independent appraisal and was charged to expense in the december quarter 
impairment charges credits and other nonrecurring costs 
in  we recognized an impairment charge of 
million relating to a medical image distribution product that we abandoned in favor of a comparable solution offered by amicas 
in  we received final payments from three former officers totaling million satisfying their outstanding loans from us  including interest 
consequently  we recorded a credit of million  reflecting a complete reversal of the allowance for loan losses established in march in  we recognized impairment charges and incurred other nonrecurring costs of million 
these costs and expenses included the million provision for loan losses relating to the notes receivable from former officers  
million for unused equity financing  
million of executive severance for separation benefits paid to our former chairman pursuant to the terms of a mutual separation agreement and a pre existing employment agreement  and retention bonuses of 
million for terminated employees 
as of march   management determined that collection was doubtful with respect to approximately million of the outstanding balance of the officer loans and  accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance and ceased accruing interest on the loans 
restructuring costs credits 
in the fourth quarter of  we committed to restructuring our medical businesses through a plan of employee reductions 
our work force was reduced by approximately employees and  as a result  we incurred a restructuring charge in of approximately 
million associated with employee severance and other termination benefits 
in  we recognized a credit of 
million reflecting a savings in connection with the early termination of an office lease for a facility closed as part of a restructuring plan announced in in  we recorded credits of 
million resulting from changes in accounting estimates relating to facility closure and employee severance costs incurred in in connection with the restructuring plan 
loss on headquarters building held for sale 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to our former headquarters building in atlanta 
we sold the building in august for proceeds of million  after closing costs 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale was used to repay the million mortgage loan on the building 
interest income expense year ended december  change change dollars in thousands interest income  interest expense    the interest income comparisons primarily reflect interest recognized in in connection with the recovery of the notes receivable from former officers 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs incurred in connection with our outstanding term and real estate mortgage loans 
as of august  the mortgage loans were repaid in full 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a decline in the average outstanding principal balance and associated interest rate under our credit agreement 
in  we expect interest expense to increase relating to the million we borrowed in november in connection with the acquisition of amicas 
income taxes for and  we recorded income tax provisions of 
million 
no income tax provision or benefit was recognized in management has assessed the realizable value of our deferred tax assets of million and determined that a valuation allowance of million was necessary as of december  to  along with deferred tax liabilities of million  reduce the net deferred tax asset to million  an amount which we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in reaching this conclusion  management noted that internal projections indicate that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets within four to five years 
our effective income tax rate was less than for primarily due to recognition of a portion of our deferred tax assets through changes in the associated valuation allowance 
we expect an income tax provision of approximately 
million in loss from discontinued operations discontinued operations represent the results of practiceworks  inc  a provider of practice management software for dental and oral surgery practices  through march  on that date  we distributed of the common stock of practiceworks to our stockholders 
for the period january  to march   our net loss from discontinued operations was million 
for further details regarding the distribution of shares of practiceworks to our stockholders  see note d of the accompanying financial statements 
net income loss as a result of the above factors  our operating results for decreased to net income of million from net income of million in which had increased from a net loss of million in to date  the overall impact of inflation on us has not been material 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our business through positive cash flows from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock and long term borrowings 
for  and  we generated positive cash flows from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in primarily reflects the decrease in software sales and the increases in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above  as well as our payment to ndc  discussed below 
in october  we expanded our august agreement with national data corporation  or ndc  for outsourcing much of our patient statement and invoice printing work 
we continue  for a fee  to provide printing services for our physicians under the subcontracting arrangement with ndc 
the amended arrangement  which extends until april  provides for  among other things  the attainment of certain quarterly transaction processing volume levels during the term 
in exchange  we received million in cash in in connection with the august agreement  we had received million  which represent unearned discounts see accompanying balance sheets that are recognized as an offset to cost of maintenance and services revenues as the minimum volume commitments are fulfilled 
in april  our arrangement with ndc was amended such that commencing in june  the quarterly minimum volume commitments were reduced 
in turn  we refunded million of unearned discounts 
the new quarterly commitment approximates of our current aggregate transaction level 
these discount amounts  received and refunded  have been classified as cash provided by and used in operating activities 
days sales outstanding calculated as accounts receivable  net of allowances  divided by annual revenues multiplied by days for was days  up from days for and days for assuming that we sell more of our products and services to hospitals and large medical imaging centers  we would expect this trend to continue 
investing activities for resulted in a use of cash of million 
this total includes million used to acquire amicas  million used for software development costs  and million used primarily for purchases of computer equipment and software including an enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
once fully implemented  the erp system will serve all businesses and departments of our company as an integrated information system 
financing activities for provided cash of million  consisting of proceeds of million received under our acquisition credit line and million of payments received in connection with the exercise of stock options by employees  partly offset by million of principal payments of long term debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million of total long term debt 
cash equivalents are comprised primarily of investment grade commercial paper  time deposits  and us federal  state and political subdivision obligations with varying terms of three months or less 
in august  we entered into an amended and restated four year credit agreement with wells fargo foothill  inc the amended agreement included our outstanding term loan of million at an interest rate of prime plus 
at december  
interest is payable monthly in arrears 
principal is payable quarterly through april   with a balloon payment in august should we decide to prepay the term loan in full prior to year three  we would incur a prepayment fee equal to in year one and in year two of the then outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
the prepayment fee may be reduced should the loan be prepaid in connection with a change of control of vitalworks 
the outstanding term loan  which is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and intellectual property rights  subjects us to certain restrictive covenants  including i the required maintenance of minimum levels of recurring revenues and earnings  as defined  ii an annual limit on the amount of capital expenditures  iii the required maintenance of a minimum of million in cash  and iv the prohibition of dividend payments to stockholders 
the amended agreement also provides for an acquisition credit line of up to million  less any amounts outstanding under term loans 
availability of the acquisition credit line is at the discretion of wells fargo 
on november  in connection with the amicas acquisition  we borrowed million under the credit line in the form of a term loan at an interest rate of prime plus 
at december  
principal is payable in equal quarterly installments  which began on january   and interest is payable in arrears 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the general timing of future payments under our outstanding loan agreements  lease agreements that include noncancellable terms  and other long term contractual obligations payments due by period totals thereafter in thousands long term debt      operating leases      other commitments a    other long term liabilities capital leases a included in other commitments are the following in april  we entered into an agreement to acquire program source code  object code  and engineering services from an independent software development firm 
a monthly fee of approximately 
million million per annum for development services will be incurred during the term ending january also  during a royalty term ending january  we are obligated to pay royalty fees of up to million based on related software license sales  if any 
in may  we entered into a five year agreement with a third party provider of edi services for patient claims processing 
for the first year of the agreement  we incurred 
million for processing services 
for the twelve month period ending may  we are committed to pay 
million for processing services 
thereafter  the annual services fee will range from 
million to 
million based on our volume usage in the last month of the preceding year 
we have committed  for the plan year  to contribute to our employee savings plan 
our matching contribution for is expected to be approximately million and will be made in cash and in shares of our common stock 
should there be any additional consideration due under the earn out provisions of the amicas merger agreement  the amount shall be satisfied by us in cash and or shares of vitalworks common stock 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for  including software development costs of approximately million 
from time to time  in the normal course of business  various claims are made against us 
except for proceedings described below  there are no material proceedings to which we are a party  and management is unaware of any material contemplated actions against us 
in august  we were served with a summons and complaint as part of a bankruptcy proceeding relating to a former business associate of ours 
the complaint alleges that in  we received a preference payment from the business associate and seeks to avoid and recover the 
million payment made to us 
on or about july   a consolidated class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of connecticut on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of vitalworks inc during the class period of january  to october  the defendants are vitalworks and three of our individual officers and directors 
plaintiffs have asserted claims against the defendants under section b of the securities exchange act of and against the individual defendants under section a of the exchange act 
according to the consolidated complaint  the defendants made materially false and misleading statements during the class period concerning our products and financial forecasts 
in addition  the consolidated complaint alleges that the individual defendants acted as controlling persons in connection with our alleged securities law violations 
compensatory damages in an unspecified amount  pre judgment and post judgment interest  costs and expenses  including reasonable attorneys fees and experts fees and other costs  as well as other relief the court may deem just and proper are sought 
on november   the defendants filed with the court a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b 
the motion has been fully briefed and is awaiting disposition by the court 
at this time  discovery is automatically stayed under the private securities litigation reform act and no class has been certified 
on april   a lawsuit styled david and susan jones v 
infocure corporation now known as vitalworks inc  et al  was filed in boone county superior court in indiana and the case was subsequently transferred to the northern district court of georgia 
the complaint alleges state securities law violations  breach of contract  and fraud claims against the defendants 
the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought by plaintiffs  but seeks rescission of a transaction that the plaintiffs value at million  as well as punitive damages and reimbursement for the plaintiffs attorneys fees and associated costs and expenses of the lawsuit 
on october   the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction to preserve their remedy of rescission was denied and part of their complaint was dismissed 
the plaintiffs subsequent appeal of this decision was denied 
the plaintiffs have retained new counsel and have served a second amended complaint upon the company which added  among other things  a claim for georgia rico violations 
on august   we filed with the court a partial motion to dismiss the second amended complaint which motion was granted in part and denied in part on january  subsequent to year end  we served an answer to the second amended complaint 
while management believes that we have meritorious defenses in each of the foregoing matters and we intend to pursue our positions vigorously  litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties 
thus  the outcome of these matters is uncertain and could be adverse to us 
depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution s of the contingencies  it is possible that our financial position  future results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in a particular reporting period s 
as permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  with respect to certain events or occurrences after march   we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
given the insurance coverage in effect  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  we include standard intellectual property indemnification provisions in our software license agreements 
pursuant to these provisions  we hold harmless and agree to defend the indemnified party  generally our business partners and customers  in connection with certain patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret infringement claims by third parties with respect to our products 
the term of the indemnification provisions varies  and may be perpetual 
in the event an infringement claim against us or an indemnified party is made  generally we  in our sole discretion  agree to do one of the following i procure for the indemnified party the right to continue use of the software  ii provide a modification to the software so that its use becomes noninfringing  iii replace the software with software which is substantially similar in functionality and performance  or iv refund the residual value of the software license fees paid by the indemnified party for the infringing software 
we believe the estimated fair value of these intellectual property indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of december  for  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances  together with the funds we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to finance our business 
this assumes that  among other things  we attain our projected results of operations and related cash flows  and that the earnings targets under the earn out provisions of the amicas merger agreement are not achieved 
otherwise  we may require additional debt or equity funding which may or may not be available 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which we believe have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for future returns  discounts and bad debts  tangible and intangible assets  deferred costs  income taxes  restructurings  commitments  contingencies  claims and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize software license revenues and system computer hardware sales upon execution of the sales contract and delivery of the software off the shelf application software and or hardware 
in all cases  however  the fee must be fixed or determinable  collection of any related receivable must be considered probable  and no significant post contract obligations of ours shall be remaining 
otherwise  we defer the sale until all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
maintenance fees for routine client support and unspecified product updates are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance arrangement 
training  implementation and edi services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
most of our sales and licensing contracts involve multiple elements  in which case  we allocate the total value of the customer arrangement to each element based on the relative fair values of the respective elements 
the residual method is used to determine revenue recognition with respect to a multiple element arrangement when specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements eg  implementation  training and or maintenance services  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements of the contract eg  computer software or hardware 
the fair value of an element is determined by the average price charged when that element is sold separately eg  the fair value of maintenance services is determined based on the average renewal price charged to clients for continued maintenance 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered element s of an arrangement  the total value of the customer arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element s is delivered or until objective evidence of fair value is established 
in our contracts and arrangements with our customers  we generally do not include acceptance provisions  which would give the customer the right to accept or reject the product after we ship it 
however  if an acceptance provision is included  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we provide allowances for estimated future returns and discounts recorded as contra revenue  as well as bad debts  upon recognition of revenues 
recognition of revenues in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenues 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms carried at their face value  less allowances for estimated future returns and discounts  as well as bad debts 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and establish a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including specific customer circumstances  historical rate of write offs and the past due status of the accounts 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  the allowance is reviewed and analyzed for adequacy and is often adjusted based on the findings 
the allowance is increased through a reduction of revenues  an increase in bad debt expense and or recovery of amounts previously written off 
the allowance is reduced by write offs of amounts deemed uncollectible and adjustments to revenue and or bad debt expense  if any  based on management s determination as to the adequacy of the recorded allowance 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets that are subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows it is expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  and would no longer be amortized or depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would also be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill assets and business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and accounted for as purchase transactions 
in  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement provides that  upon adoption  we shall no longer amortize our goodwill assets 
rather  we are required to test our goodwill for impairment of value on at least an annual basis 
to date  the results of our tests have not revealed an impairment of value 
pursuant to statement  we discontinued amortizing goodwill on january our acquisition of amicas in was accounted for as a purchase transaction and  accordingly  the excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill 
acquired software and other intangible assets are being amortized through operations over their estimated economic lives 
software product development costs 
we begin capitalizing software product development costs  exclusively third party programmer fees  only after establishing commercial and technical viability 
annual amortization of these costs represents the greater of the amount computed using i the ratio that current gross revenues for the product s bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues of the product s  or ii the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product s  generally  depending on the nature and success of the product  such deferred costs are amortized over a three to five year period 
amortization commences when the product is made commercially available 
two products under development were made commercially available in no additional products were made commercially available in we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues less the estimated cost of completing the products and of performing maintenance and product support 
if our gross revenues turn out to be significantly less than our estimates  the net realizable value of our capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired 
income taxes 
we provide for taxes based on current taxable income  and the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax carrying values of our assets and liabilities deferred income taxes 
quarterly  management assesses the realizable value of deferred tax assets based on  among other things  estimates of future taxable income  and adjusts the related valuation allowance as necessary 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which amends sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers  or faq  issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab adoption of this standard had no material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 or fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no
