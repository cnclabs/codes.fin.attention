executive summary 
due to historically low interest rates during the majority of  mortgage loan production was a record breaking trillion industry wide 
the refinance boom during also generated record high margins as mortgage loan pipelines remained at near capacity industry wide 
netbank s management capitalized on these favorable market conditions  allowing the company to post record levels in all of the following categories net income of  or per share compared to a loss of  or per share  mortgage loan production of billion  a billion increase  mortgage loan sales of billion  a billion increase  and deposits of billion  a increase over the company retained billion of internally originated loans and leases during this retention replaced the runoff of previously purchased pools of loans that prepaid at record levels during late and early additionally  the company repositioned a portion of its balance sheet as it prepaid million of higher cost fixed rate federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb advances at a cost of  and sold million of investment securities available for sale at a gain of  this strategy will more effectively balance the company s interest rate sensitivity and improve the net interest margin in future periods 
management also took advantage of the favorable market conditions to push forward with its long term strategy of balancing netbank s operations to provide one third of its total income from each of its major operating segments retail banking  mortgage banking or financial intermediary  and transaction processing 
during the company reinvested some of its earnings by forming three new operating units  dealer financial services dfs  small business banking and netinsurance 
dfs originated million of auto loans in its first seven months of operations 
small business banking generated over million of deposits and added  customers in its first year of operations  and netinsurance had approximately policies in force as of december  to compare results to results  one should note that netbank purchased nps on december  and resource on march   and their respective results of operations are therefore only included since the dates of acquisition 
additionally  netbank incurred approximately million  pre tax  in charges related to integrating resource s operations  million of acquisition and severance costs and million of additional provision expense specifically for the cmc lease portfolio during financial condition general 
netbank s assets totaled billion at december   an increase of billion or from december  this large increase is primarily due to four factors 
first  the held for investment hfi portfolio increased million primarily due to the company s selective retention of billion in mortgage and home equity loans originated through its mortgage subsidiaries  million of auto loans originated through its indirect auto lending unit and million of small business equipment leases originated through its leasing subsidiary 
the billion of loan retentions was offset in part by amortization and prepayments of million 
second  netbank s portfolio of loans held for sale hfs increased million 
this increase was primarily due to record mortgage production of billion outpacing the velocity of sales into the secondary market 
the company expects the overall level of the hfs portfolio to decline as sales begin to outpace production during the first half of third  netbank  fsb executed a million commitment of fixed rate debt to lock in the net interest spread on certain loan purchases  which is recorded as a receivable and as an unsettled trade 
netbank did not have any unsettled debt commitments at the end of finally  netbank s portfolio of mortgage servicing rights msrs increased million 
the million increase in the value of the company s msrs was primarily due to the billion or increase in the principal balance of mortgage loans underlying the msrs 
throughout the company retained the majority of its originated msrs and expects to continue this strategy for the foreseeable future 
the increases mentioned above were offset in part by declines in investment securities available for sale  cash and cash equivalents and due from servicers and investors of million  million and million  respectively 
the investment securities available for sale portfolio declined million as the company chose to sell certain investment securities and use some of the proceeds to pay off certain fixed rate term advances from the fhlb 
this strategy will more effectively balance the company s interest rate sensitivity and improve the net interest margin in future periods 
cash and cash equivalents declined by million primarily due to the company more effectively using its cash to support the increase in mortgage loan production 
due from servicers and investors declined by million as a result of the company s replacement of externally serviced loans with internally originated and serviced loans 
by internally servicing its portfolio of loans and leases  netbank will accelerate its cash receipts by eliminating the delay in collection of principal and interest payments from third party servicers and allow the company to expand its cross selling efforts 
investment securities 
during  the company sold certain investment securities at gains of  netbank used some of the proceeds to pay off certain fixed rate term fhlb advances 
netbank may continue to selectively sell investment securities in order to use the proceeds to better position its net interest margin for the benefit of future periods 
additionally  the company recorded impairment charges of on two variable rate  long term corporate bonds 
the bonds had traded under book value for an extended period of time due to widening credit spreads 
both bonds carry a standard poor s a rating

loan and lease receivables 
for the year ended december   the hfi portfolio increased million to billion  a increase 
as discussed previously  the company achieved this growth by selectively retaining billion in mortgage and home equity loans originated through its mortgage subsidiaries  million of auto loans originated through its indirect auto lending unit and million of small business equipment leases originated through republic leasing 
the retention of these internally originated assets was offset in part by million of amortization and prepayments 
netbank is actively replacing its purchased loan and lease receivables portfolio with internally originated loans and leases so it can capitalize on cross selling opportunities  internally service the assets and more effectively control its credit and interest rate risk 
third party purchased loans represent only of the hfi portfolio 
as a result of the strategic retention of internally originated mortgage loans  the company has increased its percentage of residential mortgage loans to total loans and leases to as of december   compared to as of december  netbank intends to continue retaining its originated auto loans until the percentage of auto and other consumer loans to total interest earning assets reaches approximately 
at that time  the company will begin selling any excess originations into the secondary markets

item of this report for additional details regarding the company s loan and lease receivables and the associated allowance for credit losses 
asset quality and non performing assets 
the company periodically reviews the performance of its loan and lease receivables portfolio by reviewing charge offs  delinquency statistics  and various other industry statistics 
large non homogeneous credits are reviewed on a loan by loan or lease by lease basis  whereas relatively small credits with similar risk characteristic are reviewed on a pool by pool basis 
if a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or individual loan or lease is noted  the company records additional allowance through a charge to the provision for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan and lease receivables portfolio 
the company determines the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual loans and leases  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and leases and other pertinent factors 
netbank s non performing assets as a percentage of gross unpaid principal balance upb improved from at december   to at december   as the level of non performing assets held constant relative to an increase of million or in gross upb 
this same measurement excluding the cmc lease portfolio reflects a drop from to

beginning in late  netbank adopted a strategy of retaining primarily all of its originated conventional msrs in order to achieve the necessary critical mass the servicing division requires to eventually become operationally profitable 
netbank will continue to retain the majority of its originated msrs for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   the value of netbank s msrs increased  or 
the  increase in value was primarily driven by the billion or increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans underlying its msrs 
during  netbank recorded a total of  of amortization and impairment charges 
the high level of amortization and impairment was partially due to the adoption of a more robust  dynamic prepayment assumption methodology and the recognition of a higher cost to service certain loan products in the company s portfolio 
should long term mortgage rates continue to increase  as forecast by the mortgage bankers association  the company would expect its amortization and impairment charges to significantly lessen if not reverse 
reference is made to the future outlook section for additional content regarding the possible impacts of changes in interest rates on the mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
liabilities 
total liabilities for the year ended december   increased billion 
this increase was due primarily to increases of million in deposits  million in other borrowed funds and million in unsettled trades 
the increase in deposits is the result of adding  new customers  which is part of netbank s overall strategy of increasing its transactional deposit base 
the increase in other borrowed funds was primarily to support the million increase in loans held for sale 
the increase in unsettled trades relates to the commitment of million in fixed rate borrowings and the purchase of a million investment security that did not settle until the company had no outstanding unsettled trades as of december  accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by  primarily due to the increase in current tax liabilities associated with significantly higher earnings year over year 
additionally  the company completed two issuances of subordinated debt during totaling  all of the company s subordinated debt issuances are held by trusts 
the trusts have outstanding trust preferred securities which were issued to purchase the company s subordinated debt 
these increases were offset in part by a  decline in convertible subordinated debt  all of which was retired in july  and a decline of  in loans in process 
the decline in loans in process is a direct result of the decline in production during the final weeks of compared to the same period of deposits 
deposits were billion at december   a increase year over year compared to deposits of billion at december  as of december   deposits represented of total interest bearing liabilities including deposits  other borrowed funds and subordinated debt outstanding 
fhlb advances  warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements represented approximately  and subordinated debt represented less than 
during the year ended december   netbank was able to achieve both increased deposits and lower cost of funds by replacing  of higher cost certificates of deposits with  of money market and interest bearing checking accounts 
although deposits as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities fell from to during the year ended december   netbank would expect this trend to reverse as the level of other borrowed funds  which primarily supports loans held for sale  declines in proportion to expected declines in mortgage loan production 
the expected decline in mortgage loan production is based on the january   mortgage bankers association forecast of residential mortgage loan originations 
netbank will continue to emphasize transactional accounts as its primary long term funding source

shareholders equity 
total shareholders equity increased  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a  increase in retained earnings resulting from  of net income  offset in part by  of dividends 
additional paid in capital increased  primarily related to the tax benefit of non qualified option exercises 
accumulated other comprehensive income oci decreased  as a result of the change in fair value of available for sale investment securities and the realization of  in gains due to the sale of certain investment securities offset in part by of realized impairment on certain securities 
treasury stock increased  due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock at a weighted average cost of per share offset in part by the reissuance of  shares under the employee stock purchase plan and exercise of employee stock options  the issuance of  shares of restricted stock and the issuance of  shares of common stock associated with the purchase of nps 
netbank will continue to repurchase shares periodically in the public market or through private transactions 
at december    shares remained available for repurchase under current board authority 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s proposed rule disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies  the company s senior management  in conjunction with the audit committee of the board of directors  has identified valuation of mortgage servicing rights available for sale  determination of the allowance for credit losses  liabilities for representations and warranties on loans and mortgage servicing rights sold and derivatives hedging mortgage servicing rights available for sale as being the most critical accounting policies 
these policies were identified as being the most critical based on the sec s guidance in identifying them based on whether the accounting estimate required management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights available for sale 
the most important variables that require management to make estimates in the valuation of netbank s mortgage servicing rights available for sale portfolio are the prepayment rate and discount rate 
in determining the appropriate prepayment rate and discount rate to be used in its internal valuation models  netbank reviews current prepayment activities  historical prepayment activities  prevailing interest rates  general economic indicators and the secondary market for mortgage servicing rights 
the following table sets forth the change in value of the available for sale portfolio that would theoretically be recorded were management to choose to use a prepayment or discount rate that is or more adverse 
fair value   weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change   impact on fair value of adverse change   discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change   impact on fair value of adverse change   the impacts displayed above for the available for sale portfolio would be a direct reduction to the value of mortgage servicing rights available for sale and a reduction of income by nearly a corresponding amount via an impairment charge or a charge to other income 
the sensitivities above are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in an assumption generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the available for sale servicing rights portfolio is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
netbank holds an additional  of mortgage servicing rights classified as held for sale  which are not included in the preceding table 
the held for sale portfolio s value is based on its forward committed prices and would therefore not be subject to the estimates referred to in the discussion above 
allowance for credit losses 
in determining the appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses management is required to make estimates regarding the credit quality of borrowers  general economic conditions and various other factors that would impact the probability of loans or leases being repaid in full 
accordingly  management uses both internally developed metrics and external economic indicators to determine the appropriate range at which the allowance should be maintained 
at december   netbank had billion of loan and lease receivables and  of allowance for credit losses  a coverage ratio of  and incurred  of provision expense related to maintaining the allowance within the appropriate range 
netbank recorded net charge offs of  which was less than of the average loan and lease receivable balance during this compares with the company holding million of loan and lease receivables and  of allowance  a coverage ratio of  and incurring  of provision expense related to maintaining the allowance within the appropriate range during netbank recorded net charge offs of  which was less than of the average loan and lease receivables balance during the allowance for credit losses contains  specifically allocated to the cmc lease portfolio 
although management feels the company will ultimately prevail in its litigation against the sureties  it also has determined that maintaining the current allowance is prudent 
liability for representations and warranties 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to liability  and potential losses  under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans and the purchasers of servicing rights 
under certain circumstances  the company may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify the purchasers of loans or servicing rights for losses if there has been a breach of representations or warranties 
estimation of a liability for such representations and warranties is difficult for two reasons 
first  since netbank is not the primary servicer for many of the loans or loans underlying the mortgage servicing rights it has sold in the past  it has no knowledge as to the current status of previously sold loans and mortgage servicing rights and the extent of the pipeline of unasserted repurchase requests 
second  as new mortgage products are introduced that may have documentation or underwriting criteria substantially different from products historically originated and sold  the company has no historic information with respect to the expected frequency of repurchase requests or of the expected loss severity 
the company estimates its liability for representations and warranties using the best information it has in the circumstances 
for loan products where the company has a history of past repurchase frequency and loss severity  the company uses that historical vintage loss data to project its future liability 
however  since the company is not the servicer and has no information of the current status of such loans  such historic repurchase frequency and loss severity may not be the best indicator of future repurchase losses as the result of changes in the levels of prepayments which affect repurchase frequency 
likewise  changes in general economic conditions such as unemployment levels and housing values can affect the frequency and loss severity of future repurchases under representations and warranties 
for new products that are substantially different in underwriting criteria and documentation standards than that of historic product offerings  the company initially estimates repurchase frequency from initial quality control tests and uses loss severity from other similar products for its estimate of severity 
as these new products season  the company adjusts its process to include the historical frequency and loss severity trends for the product 
the company s reserve for its estimated losses for its liability for representations and warranties was million as of december  changes to frequency or severity would cause linear changes to the reserve requirements 
the company repurchased approximately million and million of unpaid principal balances during and  respectively 
derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of its risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all of the company s derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivatives is critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the valuation of the company s derivatives is based on third party mid market quotes from a cross section of wall street dealers or from a model utilizing wall street accepted valuation methodologies  and is therefore  generally calibrated to third party mid market quotes 
because the majority of the derivative instruments on the company s balance sheet are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities in its balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged 
income statement volatility can occur if the company makes the decision to not fully hedge the attendant risk  the costs related to hedging reduce the net benefit related to hedging the attendant risk or the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the company  in the normal course of business  is party to various off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include the company s obligation to make scheduled payments for its operating leases  its liability to repurchase loans under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of its mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights  and its obligation to make scheduled principal and interest payments on borrowed funds 
the following table summarizes the company s obligations under these arrangements by type and scheduled payment less than year years years after years total borrowed funds     unsettled trades      operating leases     liabilities under representations and warranties   includes contractually due principal and interest 
reference is made to note of the consolidated financial statements contained within this report regarding details of the company s operating leases and to note for details concerning netbank s borrowed funds 
a detailed discussion regarding the company s liabilities under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of its mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights can be found in note of the consolidated financial statements or the critical accounting policies section contained within this report 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting policies section contained within this report  the company cannot accurately predict the volume or timing of when  or if  mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights will be presented for repurchase  therefore  the estimated total liability is evenly spread across the next five years 
results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general 
netbank s management capitalized on the favorable market conditions during  allowing the company to post record levels in all of the following categories net income of  or per share compared to a loss of  or per share  deposits of billion  a increase over  mortgage loan production of billion  a billion increase  and mortgage loan sales of billion  a billion increase 
management also took advantage of the favorable market conditions to push forward with its long term strategy of balancing netbank s operations to provide one third of its total income from each of its major operating segments retail banking  mortgage banking or financial intermediary  and transaction processing 
to compare results to results one should note that netbank purchased resource on march   and its results of operations are therefore included in only nine of the twelve months during additionally  netbank incurred approximately million  pre tax  in charges related to integrating resource s operations  million of acquisition and severance costs and million of additional provision expense specifically for the cmc lease portfolio during interest income 
netbank s interest income for the year ended december   was  compared to  for as detailed in the following rate volume variance table  netbank lowered the average balance of its short term investments  investment securities available for sale and loan and lease receivables by   and  respectively  and increased the average balance of its loans held for sale by billion which resulted in a net increase of  in the average balance of interest earning assets 
this repositioning allowed the company to earn long term yields on a greater percentage of its interest earning assets while effectively holding short term held for sale assets 
during  netbank retained billion of internally originated mortgage loans  million of auto loans and million in small business equipment leases 
as the company continues to selectively retain internally originated loans and leases  the average balance of loan and lease receivables should increase as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
this expected increase in loan and lease receivables as a percentage of total interest earning assets will be magnified by the expected decline in the average balance of loans held for sale 
the expected decline is based on the january   mortgage bankers association s forecast of residential mortgage originations being lower in compared to as discussed in note in the consolidated financial statements included within this report  the company did not accrue and has not received approximately million and million of interest related to the cmc lease portfolio during and  respectively

interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the  decline is primarily due to the basis point reduction in the average cost of funds  offset in part by the impact of a  increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
for the year ended december   there was  of interest expense on deposits including checking  money market and certificates of deposits as compared to  for the  net decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of a basis point decline in the average rate paid on deposits resulting in a positive  rate variance  partially offset by a negative volume variance of  due to an increase in the average interest bearing deposit balance of  for the year ended december   interest expense on other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  subordinated debt and convertible subordinated debt was  compared to  for the  decline in interest expense related to other borrowed funds is the result of a basis point decline in the average cost of funds  partially offset by the impact of a  increase in the average outstanding balance 
the basis point reduction in the average cost of other borrowed funds was primarily due to fixed rate term fhlb advances being prepaid and replaced with variable rate advances  repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit 
netbank also reduced its overall cost of funds during the period by reallocating its sources of funds to rely more heavily on deposits with an average cost of basis points as opposed to other borrowed funds with an average cost of basis points 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december   compared to  or of average interest earning assets for the following table details the relative interest rates and average balances of netbank s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december  and average balance average yield rate interest variance attributable to variance rate volume interest earning assets   short term investments   investment securities    loans held for sale    loans and leases receivable   total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities   checking accounts     money market     certificates of deposit    short term debt     fhlb advances    subordinated debt   convertible subordinate debt   total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin     interest free sources   net interest income to interest earning assets     based on amortized cost  changes in fair value are not considered

non interest income 
non interest income increased  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for of this increase  gain on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights accounted for  this large increase was primarily attributable to the strong performance in the mortgage banking segment and resource s mortgage subsidiaries not being included in the first three months of the mortgage subsidiaries improved results were attributable to a generally lower interest rate environment resulting in higher production and more favorable pricing conditions 
service charges and fees increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  in  of the increase is attributable to the addition of resource s mortgage servicing operation

the high level of refinance activity during  associated with the low interest rate environment  drove the increase in amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
the increase in salaries and wages was primarily driven by the billion  on a comparable basis  increase in production during compared to additionally  professional fees increased  on a comparable basis  due primarily to the million of legal expenses associated with the cmc litigation 
these increases were partially offset by declines in loan servicing expenses of  which should continue to decline as netbank replaces externally serviced loans with internally originated and serviced loans  and customer service expenses of  related to the consolidation of back office processes and lower cash item losses due to more aggressive fraud prevention efforts

the adjusted decline in total expenses was primarily due to a decrease of  in external loan servicing fees and a decline of  in customer service expenses  which includes cash item losses 
these declines were offset in part by increases of  in salaries and benefits   in data processing and  in professional fees 
although the retail bank lost  during  it recorded pre tax income of in the fourth quarter of  and the company would expect this segment to increase its pre tax contribution to netbank s consolidated earnings during the earnings were lower than expected due to the  of prepayment fees on fhlb advances and the retail bank lending a large portion of its funds to the mortgage banking segment to support its record billion of production

other segment for the year ended december   the other segment recorded a pre tax loss of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the same period of the loss includes netbank s strategic initiatives and holding company expenses  including dealer financial services  netinsurance  netbank  inc  resource and nb partners  inc 
the loss included charges associated with the acquisition of resource on march  results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general 
net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared with net income of  or per share  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december   was primarily related to the numerous charges associated with the acquisition of resource on march   and the subsequent repositioning of the company s balance sheet and operational units to reflect netbank s financial intermediary strategy

the year ended december  was also negatively impacted by approximately million of lost interest on the delinquent cmc leases  as discussed above 
until the litigation for the delinquent leases is resolved  the company will continue to be negatively impacted by approximately this amount on an annual basis 
during interest rates remained relatively low having a positive impact on the company s mortgage operations 
netbank is aggressively expanding its mortgage operations into products that are less sensitive to changes in interest rates and developing other segments such as insurance and processing  to further diversify its revenue sources 
interest income 
interest income related to the company s loans  leases  and investment portfolio for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  a  increase 
the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  million of which relates to mortgage loans held for sale due to the addition of resource s mortgage operations  offset by a decrease in the average yield of 
the yield on investment securities declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as management shortened the duration to reduce the convexity risk and improve the interest rate characteristics of the portfolio with the reinvestment of the funds in discount agency notes  fed funds and mortgage loans held for sale 
the yield was further negatively impacted by the overall decline in interest rates from period to period 
yields on loan and lease receivables declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of the write down of loan premiums due to accelerated prepayments from a declining rate environment  non accrual status of delinquent business equipment leases resulting in lost interest of million and the adjustable interest rate portfolio re pricing downward 
loan yields on mortgage loans held for sale for the year ended december  were as compared to for the year ended december  average yields on mortgage loans held for sale declined in relation to the decline in interest rates from period to period 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this is primarily due to the increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities to support the mortgage operations of resource and the increased production at market street 
interest expense on deposits checking  money market and certificates of deposit was  for the year ending december  compared to  for the year ended december  the net decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of the average interest rate paid on deposits declining from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   resulting in a positive variance of  this positive variance was offset in part by an increase in average deposit balances from billion to billion for the year ended december   resulting in a negative variance of  interest expense associated with other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  trust preferred and convertible subordinated debt increased  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  due primarily to the million increase in the average balance of short term debt  which included several new revolving lines of credit  warehouse lines of credit  master repurchase facilities and a commercial paper conduit facility all secured by mortgage loans held for sale related to the acquisition of resource 
the average rate on other borrowed funds decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in the overall cost of funds was associated with the more efficient use of short term borrowings coupled with the overall decline in interest rates 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  compared to  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the increase in average interest earning assets from the acquisition of resource coupled with the lower cost of funds

provisions for credit losses  net of recoveries on loans previously charged off  are added to the allowance 
the provision for credit losses increased by  to  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  of the  of provision for credit losses   was due to the establishment of an additional allowance for the cmc leases that are currently in litigation  as discussed in more detail in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
non interest income 
non interest income increased by  to  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period of this increase is primarily due to gain on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights of million generated by the company s mortgage subsidiaries  rbmg  meritage and market street as compared to million generated during rbmg and meritage had not been acquired and  therefore  were not included in the company s results

liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
netbank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing  and financing activities 
netbank s primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  sales of loans  sales or maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
netbank can use cash generated through the retail deposit market  its traditional funding source  to offset the cash utilized in investing activities 
netbank s available for sale securities and short term interest earning assets can also be used to provide liquidity for lending and other operational requirements 
for the year ended december   netbank had negative cash flow of  compared to positive cash flow of  for the net cash out flow during primarily related to an million increase in loan and lease receivables  a million increase in loans held for sale  a  increase in mortgage servicing rights and the retirement of million in convertible subordinated debt 
these cash outflows were offset in part by a million increase in deposits  a million increase in other borrowed funds  a million decline in investment securities available for sale and a million decline in due from servicers and investors 
during the first half of  netbank would expect the balance of its loans held for sale to decline  as sales of mortgage loans should exceed production 
the million increase in loan and lease receivables was primarily the result of the strategic retention of billion of internally originated loans and leases to replace the run off of million of previously purchased loans and leases 
although masked by the addition of resource s assets  the unusually high level of cash inflows during is primarily related to a million decline in loan and lease receivables  a million decline in investment securities available for sale and a million increase in deposits 
as an additional source of funds  netbank had available under existing lines of credit agreements billion at december  see note of the consolidated financial statements included as part of this report for additional details of the available lines of credit 
as of december   netbank had commitments to fund mortgage loans of million  unused home equity lines of credit of  and commercial financing commitments of  the company uses deposits as its principal source of funds 
for the year ended december   deposits increased by  to billion from billion as of december  netbank s deposit products include checking  money market accounts and certificates of deposit accounts 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
netbank is competitive in the types of accounts  services and ranges of interest rates offered on deposit products 
although market demand generally dictates which deposit maturities and rates will be accepted by the public  netbank intends to continue to promote checking  money market and certificates of deposit to the extent possible consistent with asset and liability management goals 
additionally  netbank increased its other borrowed funds  which include fhlb advances  repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit  by  during the year ended december  this increase was primarily to support the  increase in loans held for sale 
the company also raised approximately  as a result of its two issuances of subordinated debt  via trust preferred securities  during capital resources 
netbank and netbank  fsb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure of either company to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on netbank s consolidated financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  netbank  fsb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of netbank  fsb s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
netbank  fsb s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
in addition  under regulatory guidelines  netbank  fsb may not pay a dividend to netbank  inc if doing so would cause netbank  fsb to be less than adequately capitalized  as defined below 
during the year ended december   netbank s board of directors declared dividends in the amount of per share 
the funds for the payment of these dividends came from sources outside of netbank  fsb 
additionally  the board of directors declared a dividend of per common share outstanding to shareholders of record on february  during the year ended december   netbank repurchased  shares at a weighted average cost of  and has cumulatively repurchased  shares at a weighted average cost of under current board authority 
at of december   under current board authorization  management had authority to repurchase up to an additional  share through private and open market transactions 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require netbank  fsb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following table 
netbank  fsb s regulatory agency  the office of thrift supervision ots  requires netbank  fsb to maintain minimum ratios of tangible capital to tangible assets of  core capital to tangible assets of and total capital to risk weighted assets of 
additionally  netbank  inc  is subject to a side letter agreement with the ots  which was put in place in connection with netbank s acquisition of resource in the side letter requires netbank  inc to maintain minimum capital held against forward sold conforming mortgages to be the greater of or  and in no event allow the total capital to total assets to fall below and netbank  fsb to maintain core capital and total risk based capital ratios 
as of december   netbank  fsb was categorized as well capitalized as indicated in the following table  however  due to the sizable growth in assets  netbank  fsb failed to meet the total risk based capital requirement 
the company has notified the ots of this deficiency and intends to cure it as soon as possible 
the following table presents information related to netbank  fsb along with capital requirements mandated by the ots actual for capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capitalized under prompt corrective action plan amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risk weighted assets   core capital to adjusted total assets   tangible capital to adjusted total assets   n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets  n a n a december  total capital to risk weighted assets   core capital to adjusted total assets   tangible capital to adjusted total assets   n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets  n a n a in addition  netbank s subsidiaries engaged in mortgage banking must adhere to various hud regulatory guidelines including required minimum net worth to maintain their fha approved lending status 
failure to comply with the hud guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification 
as of december   market street  rbmg and meritage were in compliance with hud guidelines 
netbank and its subsidiaries are subject to various other capital requirements by secondary market investors and states 
none of these capital requirements are more stringent than the ots capital requirements 
failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
other than the side letter deficiency as described previously  at december   all of the capital requirements placed upon netbank and its subsidiaries were met  and there have been no subsequent events that would lead management to believe that continued compliance would not be met in the future 
future outlook the company is excited about the progress that it has made in becoming a premier provider of financial products and services to its targeted market segments 
netbank s strategy is multi faceted  involving internet only bank 
netbank  fsb operates as an fdic insured  federally chartered thrift institution that currently serves over  customers throughout the united states and in approximately foreign countries 
netbank  fsb operates a totally branchless model and passes on a portion of the cost savings to its customers in the form of attractive yields on deposits 
netbank  fsb s array of products and services are available to its customers hours per day  seven days a week  and all days during the year 
financial intermediary 
through its mortgage banking operations  the company serves as an intermediary between consumers and institutional investors 
the company obtains mortgage loans by originating loans directly with consumers or through brokers or by buying closed loans from a network of correspondent banks  thrifts and independent mortgage companies 
the majority of these loans are held for sale on the company s balance sheet prior to delivery into the secondary market 
the company thus earns a long term yield  on an asset held short term  and also earns origination and servicing revenues and gains on the sale of the mortgages or resulting mortgage backed securities 
transaction processor 
the company  through its resource mortgage solutions division  sells its core mortgage lending competencies on a private label basis to community banks  credit unions and other financial businesses who don t have the technical expertise  technology or critical mass to open up their own mortgage lending operations 
late in  the company expanded its transaction processing capabilities by acquiring nps 
nps is one of the top five providers of atm services for retail and non bank businesses  with  atm machines and merchant processing terminals deployed 
early in  netbank announced its five year strategy to diversify its earnings so that one third of its earnings are provided by each of its principal operating segments retail bank  financial intermediary  and transaction processing 
netbank believes that its branchless  internet only retail banking model represents the future of retail banking 
netbank believes that its deposit base will continue to grow as internet usage and internet based commerce grow 
netbank believes that it can continue to invest those deposits profitably in mortgage loans held temporarily for sale 
netbank also believes that its non interest earnings in the form of fees and gain on sale resulting from its financial intermediary and transaction processing activities will provide a better diversity of earnings than the traditional banking model 
while netbank is optimistic about its short and long term prospects  the following should be considered in evaluating its earnings and growth outlook 
dependence on mortgage banking income 
most of netbank s earnings in were provided by its mortgage banking operations 
mortgage interest rates during were at historically low levels 
this prompted refinance and home purchase mortgage volumes to grow to the highest levels in history 
total mortgage industry production volumes were just under trillion for interest rates began climbing during the third quarter of  and production volumes have already dropped 
the mortgage bankers association of america s forecast calls for total mortgage production of just under trillion for  representing a drop in volume from although the company believes that its offerings of adjustable rate products and non conforming loan products will soften some of the impact of declines in available volume  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain current levels of production volumes 
the following summarizes some of the major potential threats and opportunities of a rising rate scenario total production volume could decline  resulting in less net interest margin on loans held for sale  less gain on sale  and less production related fee revenue 
gain on sale margins could be reduced due to increased competition for available mortgage application volume 
production costs per unit could rise as the result of a reduction in leverage gained on fixed costs fixed costs are spread over a smaller number of units 
this impact may be offset  in part  by the following additional potential effects of the rising rate environment the value of servicing rights available for sale could increase as actual and forecasted prepayments go down 
although these assets are carried at the lower of cost or market  accounting rules allow for the reversal of previously provided reserves for impairment 
at december   such reserves aggregated million 
servicing hedge values would go down  offsetting a portion of the reserve recovery 
with reduced prepayments  servicing revenues would improve 
the company could elect to take a portion of existing excess liquidity and liquidity freed up by the reduced loan production volume and invest in additional interest earning assets at the  then  higher interest rates 
material pending litigation 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company is involved in litigation with three insurance companies who are sureties on some of netbank  fsb s commercial lease portfolios 
netbank  fsb has filed a claim for million in principal and interest payments that are currently past due 
the unpaid principal balance and unpaid interest balance total million  and the company maintains an allowance for losses against this portfolio of million 
the entire portfolio is on non accrual status 
the lawsuits are in the discovery stage 
although the company believes that its case against the insurance companies is strong  there is no assurance that the suit will ultimately be decided in netbank  fsb s favor nor is there any assurance as to the length of time it may take the company to prevail 
the following summarizes the material impact some of the possible outcomes could have on the results of the company s operations for and beyond a victory in the action or favorable settlement could result in the company being able to restore these assets back to accrual status 
the annual impact of non accrual status in was million 
likewise  the company may be able to reverse a portion of its existing allowance for losses on these assets 
a loss in the litigation or adverse settlement could result in the company recording additional provisions for loss on these assets and the continuation of non accrual status 
prolonged litigation could result in the continuation of non accrual status  continued payment of large legal fees  and the potential for recording additional provisions for losses on these assets in the future

the data indicates that the net value of assets and liabilities exceeds that of their associated carry value 
most of this excess value is derived from the origination of interest bearing deposits 
additionally  the table shows the exposure of the portfolio to instantaneous and parallel changes in market interest rates of and basis points 
the data suggests that the company benefits in a decline in market interest rates  versus a rise in interest rates 
this is commonly referred to as a liability sensitive position 
the largest single component of unhedged market exposure is in loan and lease receivables 
this category declines in theoretical value by million for a basis point increase in rates 
this exposure is mitigated by the duration of interest bearing deposits having offsetting exposure of million 
as a simplifying assumption  this analysis assumes that risk exposure is passively rather than actively managed  in other words  management does not attempt to alter the balance sheet position to changing market levels 
in practice  management closely monitors market exposure levels and manages the position 
market risk 
netbank s principal businesses are retail banking and the origination and purchase of mortgage loans 
these businesses are funded by customer deposits and  to the extent necessary  other borrowed funds 
consequently  a significant portion of netbank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and fluctuations in interest rates will affect netbank s future net interest income and cash flows 
this interest rate risk is netbank s primary market risk exposure 
for the year ended december   the only derivative financial instruments that netbank entered into were associated with hedging activities related to the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  the pipeline of mortgage loans for which the interest rate has been locked  the owned mortgage servicing rights portfolio and the mortgage servicing rights which netbank intends to retain associated with the pipeline of mortgage loans for which the interest rate has already been locked 
netbank has no market risk sensitive instruments held for trading purposes 
netbank s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by netbank s management 
netbank  fsb  like other savings banks  measures interest rate risk based on net portfolio value npv analysis 
npv equals the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
a npv ratio is determined by dividing npv by the present value of assets 
the following table sets forth the estimated percentage change in netbank  fsb s npv ratios as of december   and december   assuming rate shocks of to basis points limits and current npv ratios for netbank  fsb rate shock in basis points as of as of minimum as of flat computation of prospective effects of hypothetical rate changes is based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
