item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company  through its banking network  provides lending  deposit  and other banking services to businesses and individuals located in southeastern wisconsin and northeastern illinois 
it operates branch offices  in wisconsin and in illinois 
the offices are located primarily in metropolitan milwaukee and suburban chicago 
these offices generate interest earning assets  funded by interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
the company also generates revenue from fees charged for banking and mortgage banking services 
the bank invests the funds it raises through deposits and borrowings in loans and other investments 
the primary focuses of the bank s lending activities are the commercial and commercial real estate markets 
these activities require the management of credit risk through consistent adherence to credit policy and procedure  as well as  the maintenance of an adequate reserve for credit losses 
the bank s other primary challenge is to manage the spread between the rates earned on its loans and investments and the rates paid on its deposits and other borrowings 
the company s financial results are influenced by the level and direction of interest rates 
the company attempts to manage interest rate risk by matching  to a significant extent  the timing of repricing opportunities of its interest earning assets to the repricing of its interest bearing liabilities 
in low interest rate environments  such as prevailed throughout much of  the bank s fee income generally was supplemented by higher levels of fees related to the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans 
in  the company s net interest margin decreased as interest rates continued to decline 
compression in rates made it impossible to match the declines in asset yields with corresponding decreases in funding costs 
the margin was also impacted by the november repurchase of thousand shares of company s common stock at a cost of million 
as a result  despite a increase in commercial commercial real estate loans  the company s net interest income decreased by thousand 
non interest income increased by million in  driven by increased mortgage origination fees and the sale of the company s merchant credit card processing business 
non interest expenses were essentially flat in  compared to  despite higher mortgage origination commissions  nonrecurring expenses related to the sale of the merchant processing business  and consulting expenses related to the company s efforts to become more efficient 
net income increased million in over earnings per diluted share increased to in from in  due to the increase in net income and the impact of the stock repurchase in november of the following discussion provides more detail and is intended as a review of the significant factors affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended december   as well as providing comparisons with previous years 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
all significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
management has determined that its accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses is the accounting area requiring subjective or complex judgments to the company s financial position and results of operations  and therefore  is its most important critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and th e use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statement of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision for loan losses section of management s discussion 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under statement  the company is required to perform annual impairment tests of its goodwill and intangible assets and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  wh ich includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as a result of the impairment evaluation in the current year  there was no deemed impairment to the company s goodwill balance 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers

for the year ended december   taxable equivalent net interest income decreased million to million 
changes in the volume of outstanding interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities accounted for an increase of million while changes in interest rates accounted for a decrease of million in taxable equivalent net interest income 
throughout  the company s near term interest sensitive assets exceeded its near term interest liabilities  resulting in a lower margin in a declining ratio environment 
taxable equivalent total interest income decreased million in mainly due to the significant declining rate environment  offset by the increase in the volume of average total outstanding loans 
as a result of the volume increase  interest income improved million for the year ended december  interest income decreased by million due to the declining interest rate environment 
the combined impact of these changes resulted in a decrease in the company s taxable equivalent yield on interest earning assets to in from in refer to the table in item  selected financial data  for a reconciliation of taxable equivalent total interest income to gaap based total interest income

the increase of thousand in compared to reflects an increase in loans outstanding  as well as  the complexity in the loan portfolio 
as discussed in the balance sheet analysis section below  growth in loans has been concentrated in the commercial and commercial real estate categories 
these loans inherently involve more risk than exists in residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the decrease of million in compared to is due to a million additional provision in offset by management s decision to increase the allowance in the increases in annual pro vision reflect the change in the total loan portfolio with increases in commercial and commercial real estate loans and decreases in real estate mortgages

income in this category decreased thousand in compared to  mainly due to the phase out of the credit card merchant processing service 
the company realized thousand in net investment security gains for the year ended december  due to the sale of approximately million of investment securities 
for the year ended december   the company realized thousand in net investment security gains 
during  both purchases and sales of investment securities were increased due to a new repurchase agreement program established with a local county treasurer 
this program accounted for million in investment purchases and million of investment sales 
the gain on sale of residential mortgage loans of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  were all due to increased refinancing activity on residential mortgages 
other income increased million in and thousand in the increase in was due to a gain of approximately million from the sale of the merchant credit card processing service and million of income from a full year inclusion of bank owned life insurance 
these increases in other income were offset by a decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets due to a sale in of rental property that was adjacent to the hales corners office

balance sheet analysis the composition of assets and liabilities are generally the result of management decisions influenced by market forces 
the company reported total assets at december  of 
billion and billion at december lending activities the company s largest asset category continues to be loans 
the company s gross loans  as a percentage of total deposits  were at december  compared to at december  the following table shows the company s loan portfolio composition on the dates indicated dollars in thousands 
at december  of total of total of total of total of total commercial commercial real estate real estate mortgage installment other total loans total loans outstanding increased million in  mainly due to internal growth and the acquisitions of lakes region bancorp and hawthorn corporation 
increases of million in commercial and commercial real estate loans were partially offset by declines in residential real estate mortgages and consumer installment loans 
total loans outstanding decreased million in  due to the conversion of approximately million of long term fixed rate mortgages into a mortgage backed security during the first quarter of the decrease from the conversion was substantially offset by increased loan growth  mainly in the commercial real estate category 
the company continues to emphasize commercial and commercial real estate lending 
commercial loans increased million in and million in commercial loans are underwritten according to the company s loan policy  which sets forth the amount of credit which can be extended based upon the borrower s cash flow  debt service capacity  leverage and discounted collateral value 
commercial loans are typically made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the business 
in recognition of specific borrower risk  as well as inherent risk due to the general economic environment  the company emphasizes capacity to repay the loan  adequacy of the borrower s capital  an evaluation of th e industry conditions affecting the borrower  and current credit file documentation 
the company s commercial loans are typically secured by the borrower s business assets such as  inventory  accounts receivable  fixtures  and equipment 
generally  commercial loans carry the personal guarantees of the principals 
commercial real estate mortgages represent the company s largest loan category  comprising of the loan portfolio at december  and at december  commercial real estate loans increased million in compared to primarily due to internal growth and the acquisition of lakes region bancorp and hawthorn corporation 
commercial real estate loans increased million in compared to primarily due to strong local conditions 
the company s commercial real estate loans continue to be primarily focused on owner occupied  improved property such as office buildings  warehouses  small manufacturing operations  and retail facilities located in the company s primary market areas subject to a m aximum loan to value ratio pursuant to its loan policy 
loans for construction and land development are generally secured by the property under construction or development up to a maximum loan to value of of estimated cost or appraisal value of the completed project  whichever is less 
the company further monitors construction and land development credits by disbursing draws under the credit commitment upon satisfactory title company inspections of construction progress and evidence of proper lien waivers 
the borrower s creditworthiness and the economic feasibility and cash flow abilities of the project are fundamental concerns in the company s commercial real estate and construction land development lending 
loans secured by commercial property  whether existing or under construction  and land development are generally larger in size and involve greater risks than residential mortgage loans because payments on loans secured by commercial property are dependent upon the successful operatio n and management of these properties  businesses  or developments 
as a result  the value of properties securing such loans are likely to be subject to the local real estate market and general economic conditions  including movements in interest rates 
the company generally writes commercial real estate loans for maturities up to five years although the total amortization period may be as long as twenty five years  amortized monthly 
the company generally writes construction and land development loans on terms up to a maximum of months and requires the borrower to make defined principal reductions at stated intervals during that term 
the company additionally attempts to have construction credits further supported by end mortgage commitments  wherever possible 
the company will generally make credit extensions for land development projects to experienced  strong borrowers with adequate outside liquidity to support the project in the event the actual project performance is slower than projection 
the company s real estate loans  like all of the company s loans  are underwritten according to its written loan policy 
the loan policy sets forth the term  debt service capacity  credit extension  and loan to value guidelines  which the company considers acceptable to recognize the level of risk associated with each specific loan category 
the following table sets forth the percentage composition of the real estate loan portfolio as of december  commercial real estate family first liens on residential real estate multifamily residential family junior liens on residential real estate including home equity lines of credit construction  land development  and farmland installment loans decreased million during and million during due to strong refinance activity in a low rate environment  primarily into real estate mortgages 
the decrease is also due to the company s phase out of the purchasing of loan contracts from auto dealers 
the following table shows the maturity of loans excluding residential mortgages on one to four family residences  and installment loans outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands and the amounts due after one year classified according to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial real estate mortgage loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates variable interest rates total risk elements in the loan portfolio certain risks are inherent in the lending function including a borrower s subsequent inability to pay  insufficient collateral overage  and changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to reduce these risks by adherence to a written set of loan policies and procedures 
included in these policies and procedures are underwriting practices covering debt service coverage  loan to value ratios  and loan term 
evidence of a specific repayment source is required on each credit extension  with documentation of the borrower s repayment capacity 
generally  this repayment source is the borrower s cash flow  which must demonstrate the ability to service the debt based upon historical results and projections of future performance 
management maintains the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance at a level considered adequate to provide for estimable and probable loan losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings  and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
at december   the allowance was million and million at december  the determination of allowance adequacy is based upon on going evaluations of the company s loan portfolio conducted by the internal loan review function of the bank and reviewed by management 
these evaluations consider a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  loan portfolio size and composition  previous loss experience  the borrowers financial condition  collateral adequacy  and the level of non performing loans 
as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance increased to at the end of compared to at the end of management considers the increase in the allowance to be prudent in consideration of the loan growth experienced by the bank in the past year and the increase in credit risk inherent in commercial and commercial real estate loans  where the growth has been concentrated 
based on its analysis  management considers the allowance adequate to recognize the risk inherent in the consolidated loan portfolio at december  the balance of the allowance and actual loan loss experience for the last five years is summarized in the following table dollars in thousands years ended december  balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage installment other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage installment other total recoveries net charge offs balance of acquired allowances at date of acquisitions additions charged to operations balance at end of period ratios net charge offs to average loans outstanding net charge offs to total allowance allowance to year end loans outstanding when  in the opinion of management  serious doubt exists as to the collectibility of a loan  or the loan becomes days or more past due  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
at the time a loan is classified as nonaccrual  interest credited to income in the current year is reversed and interest income accrued in the prior year is charged to the allowance

the percentage of non performing assets to total assets was at december  compared to at december  the increase is due to one large parcel of other real estate with a million carrying value 
the company expects to sell this parcel in early at a price resulting in no loss to state 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
fasb defines a loan as impaired if  based on current information or events  it is probable that a creditor will not be able to collect all amounts both contractual principal and interest due in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
at december   the company identified approximately million in loans considered impaired pursuant to this definition 
these loans are included as part of the nonaccrual loans set forth in the table above 
based upon the analyses of the underlying collateral value of these loans and the low percentage of these loans in relation to the gross loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is adequate to provide for the inherent risk associated with these loans 
at december   there were no additional loans to borrowers where available information would indicate that such loans were likely to later be included as nonaccrual  impaired as defined in fasb statement no 
 past due  or restructured 
investment activities investment securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
investment securities that the company does not have either the positive intent and or the ability to hold to maturity and all marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and carried at their respective fair market values 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities classified as available for sale  net of related tax effects  are carried as a component of shareholders equity 
the company has no assets classified as trading 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
total investment securities outstanding at december  decreased million  mainly due to the redeployment of proceeds from mortgage related securities repayments into loans

at december  of total of total of total us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions mortgage related securities other securities total during  the company strategically decided to leverage its balance sheet to more fully utilize its capital to create additional net interest income 
all leverage transactions were structured to match fund the investment purchase with a borrowing either repurchase agreements or fhlb borrowings of comparable maturity  duration  or term to interest repricing 
the resulting spread from each transaction the difference between the acquired asset yield and the related funding cost was targeted at basis points at a minimum 
balances in mortgage related securities declined by million in  due to accelerated repayments of underlying mortgages fueled by robust refinance activity in the low interest rate environment that prevailed for most of the year 
much of the proceeds of these repayments were reinvested in the company s loan portfolio and in short term obligations of us government agencies  which increased by million 
as a result  mortgage related securities declined from of the company s investment portfolio at december  to at december   while obligations of us government agencies  as a percentage of the company s investment portfolio  increased from at december  to at december  the company s investment philosop hy in continued to emphasize minimizing interest rate risk 
obligations of states and political subdivisions decreased million at december  compared to december   while investments in other securities increased by million in the same time period 
other securities consist of pools of trust preferred securities  investment grade corporate debt  and unrated preferred issues of other financial institutions 
the percentage of the company s investment portfolio held in obligations of states and political subdivisions decreased from at december  to at december  the maturities and weighted average yield of the company s investment securities at december  are presented in the following table dollars in thousands

unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity securities are impacted by the current market price quoted for the underlying security in relation to the price at which the security was acquired by the company 
unrealized gains and losses on debt securities are the result of changes in market interest rates 
deposits deposits are the company s principal funding source 
deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates  money market conditions  market competition  and the overall condition of the economy

month or less over through months over through months over months total approximately of the company s total assets at december  were supported by time deposits with balances in excess of thousand as compared to at december  liquidity the primary functions of asset liability management are to assure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers 
the company s primary funding sources are deposits  loan principal and interest payments  and maturities of loans and investment securities 
contractual maturities and amortization of loans and investments are predictable funding sources  whereas deposit flows and loan prepayments are impacted by market interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
the company uses wholesale funding sources  such as the federal home loan bank  to balance the timing differences between its various business funding sources and to support loan origination 
the company s primary use of funds is loan originations 
during  internally generated loans increased million 
growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans were offset by declines in residential mortgages and consumer loans 
other uses of funds were to fund a million decrease in deposits  acquire lakes region bancorp and hawthorn corporation  reduce federal funds purchased by million  pay dividends of million  purchase million of premises and equipment  reduce federal home loan bank advances of million and purchase thousand of treasury stock 
sources of funds came from a million increase in cash provided by operating activities  million in notes payable  million in repur chase agreements  in net decrease of investments securities and million from the exercise of stock options 
cash and cash equivalents are generally the company s most liquid assets 
the company s level of operating  financing  and investing activities during a given period impact the resultant level of cash and cash equivalents reported 
the company had liquid assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
liquid assets in excess of necessary cash reserves are generally invested in short term investments such as federal funds sold  commercial paper  and interest earning deposits 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk is an inherent part of the banking business as financial institutions gather deposits and borrow funds to finance interest earning assets 
interest rate risk results when the timing of repricing of rates paid on deposits and other borrowings does not coincide with the timing of repricing of interest earning assets 
interest rate risk management seeks to avoid fluctuations in net interest margins during periods of changing interest rates 
the following table shows the estimated repricing time frames  including maturity structure for fixed rate instruments  of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for three different independent and cumulative time intervals as of december  dollars in millions 
for purposes of presentation in the following table  the company used the national deposit decay rate assumptions published by the office of the comptroller of the currency as of december   which  for now accounts  money market accounts  and savings deposits in the one year or less category were   and  respectively 
although the actual repricing of certain assets and liabilities may not coincide fully with the table  the repricing opportunities listed indicate a slightly of earning assets asset sensitive position in the cumulative one year time frame 
this would normally indicate that during periods of rising interest rates  the company s net interest margins would expand in the near term and during periods of declining interest rates the margin would decrease in the first year

variable rate loans and maturing fixed rate loans and investments are the primary interest sensitive assets repricing within one year 
time deposits  money market deposits  and repurchase agreements are the most significant liabilities subject to repricing within one year

the increase of million in was due to net retained earnings of million  and the exercise of stock options of million  offset by a decrease in tax effected unrealized gains in the company s investments portfolio of million and the repurchase of twenty five thousand shares of its common stock in the open market at an average price of 
additionally  in december  the company completed its dutch auction tender offer  purchasing and retiring thousand shares at per share

total assets increased in in comparison to primarily due to the acquisition of lakes region bancorp and hawthorn corporation 
total assets increased in in comparison to primarily due to the company leveraging its balance sheet 
acquisitions and asset growth  coupled with the company s stock repurchase program and dutch auction tender offer  impacted the average equity to asset ratios of   and in the years   and  respectively 
there are certain regulatory constraints which affect the company s capital levels 
at december   the company s actual regulatory amounts and ratios exceeded those necessary to be defined as well capitalized under regulatory framework 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional explanation of these regulatory constraints 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time impacted by inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the company s other expenses which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
consequently  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s perfo rmance than do the general levels of inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on the company s financial results is its ability to react to interest rate changes and endeavors to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide fluctuations in the company s net interest margin 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us currency with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has a limited number of agricultural loans and accordingly has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates are assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk irr is the exposure of a banking organization s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
accepting this risk can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value  however excessive levels of irr can significantly impact the company s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains irr at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating a financial institution s exposure to interest rate changes includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to monitor and control irr and the organization s quantitative exposure level 
when assessing the irr management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems  and internal controls are in place to maintain irr at prudent levels 
evaluating the quantitative level of irr exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity  and where appropriate  asset quality 
the federal reserve board  together with the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic  adopted a joint agency policy statement on irr 
the policy statement provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing irr  which forms the basis for an ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of irr management at institutions under their respective supervision 
the policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior federal reserve guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing irr 
specifically  the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk management process which effectively identifies  measures  and contro ls irr 
financial institutions derive their income primarily from the excess of interest collected over interest paid 
the rates of interest an institution earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  an institution is exposed to lower profit margins or losses if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
for example  assume that an institution s assets carry intermediate or long term fixed rates and that those assets are funded with short term liabilities 
if market interest rates rise by the time the short term liabilities must be refinanced  the increase in the institution s interest expense on its liabilities may not be sufficiently offset if assets continue to earn at the c ontractual long term fixed rates 
accordingly  an institution s profits could decrease on existing assets because the institution will either have lower net interest income or  possibly  higher net interest expense 
similar risks exist when assets are subject to contractual interest rate ceilings  or rate sensitive assets are funded by longer term fixed rate liabilities in a decreasing rate environment 
an institution might use various techniques to minimize irr 
one approach used by the company is to analyze its assets and liabilities and make future financing and investment decisions based on payment streams  interest rates  contractual maturities  and estimate sensitivity to actual or potential market interest rate changes 
such activities fall under the broad definition of asset liability management 
the company s primary asset liability management technique is the measurement of its asset liability gap which is defined as the difference between the cash flow amounts of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced over a given time period 
for example  if the asset amount to be repriced exceeds the corresponding liability amount subject to repricin g for a given day  month  year  or longer period  the institution is in an asset sensitive gap position 
in this situation  net interest income would increase if market interest rates rose and conversely decrease if market interest rates fell 
alternatively  if more liabilities than assets will reprice  the institution is in a liability sensitive position 
accordingly  net interest income would decline when rates rose and improve when rates fell 
also  these examples assume that interest rate changes for assets and liabilities are of the same magnitude  whereas actual interest rate changes generally differ in magnitude for assets and liabilities 
several ways an institution can manage irr include selling existing assets or repaying certain liabilities  matching repricing periods for new assets and liabilities for example by  shortening terms of new loans or investments  and hedging existing assets  liabilities  or anticipated transactions 
an institution might also invest in more complex financial instruments intended to hedge or otherwise change irr 
interest rate swaps  futures contracts  options on futures  and other such derivative financial instruments are often used for this purpose 
because these instruments are sensitive to interest rate changes  they require management expertise to be effective 
sfsc has not purchased derivative financial instruments in the past 
financial institutions are also subject to prepayment risk in falling interest rate environments 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at new  lower interest rates 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce the company s interest income and overall asset yields 
certain portions of an institution s liabilities may be short term or due on demand  while most of its assets may be invested in long term loans or investments 
accordingly  the company seeks to have in place sources of cash to meet short term demands 
these funds can be obtained by increasing deposits  borrowing  or selling assets 
federal home loan bank advances and short term borrowings provide additional sources of li quidity for the company 
sfsc also has a million line of credit available through a third party financial institution 
the following table sets forth information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the company had no derivative financial instruments  or trading portfolio  as of that date 
the expected maturity date values for loans  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities were calculated adjusting the underlying instrument s contractual maturity date for prepayment expectations 
expected maturity date values for interest bearing deposits were not based upon estimates of the period over which the deposits would be outstanding  but rather the opportunity for repricing 
similarly  with respect to its variable rate instruments  the company believes that repricing dates  as opposed to maturity dates are more re levant in analyzing the value of such instruments and are reported as such in the following table 
company borrowings are also reported based on conversion or repricing dates
