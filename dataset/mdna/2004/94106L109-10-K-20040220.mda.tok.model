item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
below is a discussion of our operations for the three years ended december  this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
we discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in item of this report  under the section factors influencing future results and accuracy of forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in light of that disclosure and together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
overview we are in an industry that provides an essential service needed by nearly every business and person 
our success depends on our ability to focus on our core business  operational excellence and financial strength and flexibility 
in  we continued to build financial strength by meeting our goal of producing adjusted free cash flow in the range of million to billion 
free cash flow is not a financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  we include it in our communications to stockholders because we believe that the amount of cash we produce from our non financing activities that is available to us for such things as acquisitions  share repurchases  debt reductions and dividends is important in evaluating our performance  including meeting our goal of providing value to our stockholders 
we compute free cash flow by taking the net cash that was provided by our operating activities  subtracting capital expenditures and adding proceeds from our divestitures and other sales of assets 
free cash flow is then adjusted for certain cash flow activity that we consider unusual for the year 
in  the net cash provided by our operating activities was approximately billion 
we spent approximately billion for capital expenditures 
after adding back the proceeds we received of approximately million from divestitures of businesses and other asset sales  our free cash flow was approximately million 
we adjusted this amount to take into consideration the approximately million net cash impact for the settlement of our stockholder class action settlement  giving us approximately billion of adjusted free cash flow in to help us improve our business and operations  we have developed branded initiatives like wasteroute and service machine  as well as other initiatives to improve safety  procurement  operations  cost control and sales 
although we made significant progress in  we have much more to do in and beyond and our company is now better positioned to reap the benefits of the programs we have put in place 
an integral part of our focus has been on internal  or organic  growth 
in  internal revenue growth was  or million  as compared to the biggest driver in this increase was price  and we continue to work on our pricing program 
however  volumes declined as compared to the prior year  due mostly to the loss of a large contract with the city of chicago early in the year  offsetting some of our pricing achievement 
we believe some of our performance in was due to general economic factors  although increased competition also played a part 
we cannot control the economy  but we can compete  and therefore we focused on customer churn rates and sales force effectiveness 
in  we continued to hold our customer churn rate below  which we see as a benchmark for success  and we maintained the same amount of new sales dollars in as compared to the prior year  even with a smaller sales force 
moreover  it is generally believed that the waste industry lags the economy by six to nine months 
consequently  our sales force effectiveness program  including our pricing strategy  should result in greater internal revenue growth if the recent economic recovery continues in and beyond 
finally  we also actively pursue strategic acquisitions in our nasw operations 
through acquisitions  we increased our revenue by million 
to achieve our goal of operational excellence  we have been working hard to seek operational and cost efficiencies 
in  we further streamlined our operating infrastructure  which resulted in the elimination of about  employee positions and contract workers 
for  we saw cost savings from the reorganization in our selling  general and administrative costs  while at the same time growing our total revenues by 
the reorganization changed the roles of our people in the field so that our operating sites are responsible for delivering service and operational excellence and the market areas are responsible for implementing strategy  improving performance and ensuring profitability in their markets 
when measured on an initiative by initiative basis  which is the way we measure our goals internally  we believe that our efforts on cost reductions and efficiency programs are paying off 
we have continued to decrease the maintenance cost per driver hour  which is the primary performance metric for fleet maintenance 
we also are focusing on container maintenance  and have created improvement plans and conducted test pilots to see where we can reduce costs 
additionally  our focus on our safety program resulted in another year over year decrease in recordable injuries and vehicle accidents  although our per claim costs continued to rise  offsetting the financial benefit of the reduced number of claims 
finally  our wasteroute initiative reduced the number of routes we have  and now we are looking for opportunities to further save on route related costs 
our operating costs and expenses for do not show the level of improvement we believe we have made in our initiatives to cut overall costs 
this is due to an increase in those costs as a result of a recharacterization of expenses that had previously been classified as selling  general and administrative costs  increased costs of goods sold due to acquisitions of recycling businesses  the implementation of sfas no 
 increased disposal costs at third party facilities and increased labor rates 
however  we believe that we have the momentum necessary to continue all of our efforts and make progress in we also believe that we have our organizational structure and field based management at the appropriate size for the current economy as well as for business opportunities from an expanding economy 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  we make several estimates and assumptions that affect our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses 
we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain of the information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data or is simply not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
the most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that deal with the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills  environmental remediation liabilities and asset impairments  as described below 
landfills effective january   our method of accounting for landfill closure and post closure  as well as landfill final capping  changed as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
through december   the waste industry generally recognized expenses associated with i amortization of capitalized and future landfill asset costs and ii future closure and post closure obligations on a units of consumption basis as airspace was consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice  referred to as life cycle accounting within the waste industry  continues to be followed  with the exception of capitalized and future landfill final capping costs 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 future final capping costs are identified by specific capping event and amortized over the specific estimated capacity related to that event rather than over the life of the entire landfill  as was the practice prior to our adoption of sfas no 
the cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
we also estimate additional costs  pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 based on the amount a third party would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing of each final capping event and closure and post closure activities 
because landfill final capping  closure and post closure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of future landfill final capping and closure and post closure activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and results of operations 
landfill costs we estimate the total cost to develop each landfill site to its final capacity 
this includes certain projected landfill costs that are uncertain because they are dependent on future events 
the total cost to develop a site to its final capacity includes amounts previously expended and capitalized  net of accumulated airspace amortization  and projections of future purchase and development costs  landfill liner construction costs  operating construction costs  and capitalized interest costs 
final capping costs we estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be finally capped and the capping materials and activities required 
the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
our engineering personnel allocate final landfill capping costs to specific capping events 
they then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final capping event and the final capping costs for each event are amortized over the related capacity associated with the event as waste is disposed of at the landfill 
closure and post closure costs we base our estimates for closure and post closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post closure maintenance and monitoring 
the estimates for landfill closure and post closure costs also consider when the costs would actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates 
the possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption uncertain 
available airspace our engineers are responsible for determining available airspace at our landfills 
this is done by using surveys and other methods to calculate  based on height restrictions and other factors  how much airspace is left to fill and how much waste can be disposed of at a landfill before it has reached its final capacity 
expansion airspace we also include currently unpermitted airspace in our estimate of available airspace in certain circumstances 
first  to include airspace associated with an expansion effort  we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year  and the final expansion permit to be received within five years 
second  we must believe the success of obtaining the expansion permit is probable  using the following criteria personnel are actively working to obtain land use and local  state or provincial approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  it is probable that the approvals will be received within the normal application and processing time periods for approvals in the jurisdiction in which the landfill is located  either we or the respective landfill owners have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan  there are no significant known technical  legal  community  business  or political restrictions or similar issues that could impair the success of such expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results demonstrate that the expansion has a positive financial and operational impact  and airspace and related costs  including additional closure and post closure costs  have been estimated based on conceptual design 
these criteria are initially evaluated by our field based engineers  accountants  managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits 
however  our policy provides that  based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill  if these criteria are not met  inclusion of unpermitted airspace may still be allowed 
in these circumstances  inclusion must be approved through a landfill specific review process that includes approval of the chief financial officer and a review by the audit committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
of the landfill sites with expansions at december   landfills required the chief financial officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace 
approximately two thirds of these landfills required approval by the chief financial officer because legal  community  or other issues could impede the expansion process  while the remaining were primarily because the permit application processes would not meet the one and five year requirements  which in many cases were due to state specific permitting procedures 
when we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of available airspace  we also include the projected costs for development  final capping  and closure and post closure of the expansion in the amortization basis of the landfill 
after determining the costs at our landfills  including final capping costs and closure and post closure costs  and the available and probable expansion airspace relating to such costs  we then determine the per ton rates that will be expensed 
we look at factors such as the waste stream  geography and rate of compaction  among others  to determine the number of tons necessary to fill the available and probable expansion airspace relating to these costs and activities 
we then divide costs by the corresponding number of tons  giving us the rate per ton to expense for each activity as waste is received and deposited at the landfill 
we calculate per ton amortization rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event  for assets related to closure and post closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future 
it is possible that actual results could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent that such estimates  or related assumptions  prove to be significantly different than actual results  or our belief that we will receive an expansion permit changes adversely in a significant manner  the costs of the landfill  including the costs incurred in the pursuit of the expansion  may be subject to impairment testing  as described below 
lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates  higher closure and post closure rates  and higher expenses or asset impairments related to the removal of previously included expansion airspace 
additionally  if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has become remote  the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately 
environmental remediation liabilities under current laws and regulations  we may have liability for environmental damage caused by our operations  or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site 
remedial costs are all costs relating to the remedy of any identified situation that occurs by natural causes or human error not expected in the normal course of business 
these costs include potentially responsible party prp investigation  settlement  certain legal and consultant fees  as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up  such as materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy 
we estimate costs required to remediate sites where liability is probable based on site specific facts and circumstances 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation  considering whether we were an owner  operator  transporter  or generator at the site  the amount and type of waste hauled to the site and the number of years we were connected with the site 
next  we review the same information with respect to other named and unnamed prps 
estimates of the cost for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other prps who may be liable for remediation of a specific site  and the typical allocation of costs among prps 
asset impairments our long lived assets  including landfills and landfill expansions  are carried on our financial statements based on their cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
however  accounting standards require us to write down assets or groups of assets if they become impaired 
if significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows 
cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets  rather than a single asset 
if cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset  we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows 
if the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows  we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value 
fair value is determined by either an actual third party evaluation or an internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group 
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs 
typical indicators that an asset may be impaired include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if any of these or other indicators occur  we review the asset to determine whether there has been an impairment 
several of these indicators are beyond our control  and we cannot predict with any certainty whether or not they will occur 
additionally  estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
there are additional considerations for impairments of landfills and goodwill  as described below 
landfills there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied to landfill development or expansion projects 
for example  a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application though the expansion permit is ultimately granted 
in addition  management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace 
therefore  certain events could occur in the ordinary course of business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry 
goodwill we assess whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances  such as those listed above  that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired

revenues from our disposal operations consist of tipping fees charged to third parties based on the volume and type of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities and are normally billed monthly or semi monthly 
fees charged at transfer stations are based on the volume of waste deposited  taking into account our cost of loading  transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site 
recycling revenue  which is generated by our recycling group as well as our five geographic operating groups  generally consists of the sale of recyclable commodities to third parties and tipping fees

price base business commodity electricity fuel total price volume internal growth acquisitions divestitures foreign currency translation price base business versus the increase in base business pricing is attributable to our collection  transfer and waste to energy businesses  with a significant increase in our residential collection operations 
certain of these price increases relate to additional costs and taxes that have been charged to our customers 
however  the increase was partially offset by our landfill business  where we experienced decreases in price related revenue principally due to our special waste landfill operations  mainly because of an increase in lower priced event work in the southern and western portions of the united states 
versus the revenue increase due to price in our base business was derived from our commercial and residential collection and transfer station operations 
however  these increases were offset partially by decreased pricing in our landfill special waste operations 
price commodity versus the commodity price increases in were driven by the prices of onp and plastic commodities 
onp prices increased to an average of per ton for as compared to an average of per ton for plastic commodity prices have increased an average of 
partially offsetting these increases is a decline in the price of occ  which has declined to an average of per ton in as compared to an average of per ton in versus there were significant increases in commodity prices in as compared to  most notably an increase in occ prices  which increased to an average price of per ton for as compared to an average price of per ton for price electricity and fuel versus electricity rates remained relatively flat in as compared to however  we experienced positive price increases due to increased fuel surcharges billed to customers as a result of higher fuel costs 
versus reduced electricity rates and fuel surcharges negatively impacted the price related revenue change in as compared to the prior year 
volume versus the decrease in revenue due to volumes was primarily in our collection and recycling businesses 
we believe the declines in collection were the result of general economic conditions and increased competition  particularly in the eastern and midwestern portions of the united states 
our loss of a contract with the city of chicago during february was the primary reason for volume declines in transfer and recycling  accounting for lost revenues of approximately million for the year ended december  partially offsetting these decreases were increases in special waste volumes at our landfills  primarily in the southern and western portions of the united states 
versus the volume decline in as compared to largely related to commercial and industrial collection services throughout our operations  with the exception of the southern portion of the united states  where we realized slight volume increases 
we also experienced declines in disposal revenue due to volume primarily in the eastern and western portions of the united states 
we believe that the overall decreased volumes  particularly in the higher margin commercial and industrial collection services  were attributable to the lagging economy and increased competition 
however  the declines were offset by increased volumes in our recycling operations of million in as compared to acquisitions and divestitures versus in connection with our formation of recycle america alliance in january  we acquired the peltz group  the largest privately held recycler in the united states 
we also acquired several collection businesses that complemented and enhanced our existing collection network 
these increases were partially offset by divestitures of low margin operations 
versus revenue in increased due to a number of individually small acquisitions consummated during and the full year effect of acquisitions completed in the increases due to acquisitions were partially offset by divestitures 
foreign currency translation versus fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar favorably affected revenues for the year ended december  versus fluctuations in the relative value of the canadian dollar negatively affected revenues for the year ended december  operating costs and expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below our operating costs and expenses include direct and indirect labor and related taxes and benefits  risks management costs  fuel  facility operating costs  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  and accretion of and expense revisions relating to future landfill capping  closure and post closure costs and environmental remediation 
certain direct landfill development expenditures are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed  and include acquisition  engineering  upgrading  construction  capitalized interest  and permitting costs 
additionally  we sometimes receive reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmentally related remedial  defense and tort claim costs 
such recoveries are included in operating costs and expenses as an offset to environmental expenses 
for the year ended december   operating costs and expenses were million higher than the prior year period  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating costs and expenses were for the year ended december   which is a percentage point increase from the prior year period 
the increase was generally due to increased cost of goods sold of approximately million  largely related to higher commodity sales through our acquisition of the peltz group in january  increased disposal costs of approximately million  attributable to related volume increases  disposal cost increases at third party facilities and increased taxes of approximately million on disposal of waste in pennsylvania  although the majority of the tax increases have been passed on to our customers as price increases  salary and wage increases of approximately million representing annual merit raises and increased overtime expenses  partially offset by headcount reductions  the reorganization of our operations in march and the determination that certain employee costs and facility related expenses were more appropriately classified as operating expenses after the adoption of the new organizational structure and the reclassification of these costs beginning in the second quarter of  the first full accounting period that these organizational changes were effective 
during the first quarter of  approximately million of such costs have been classified as operating expenses that would have been reported as selling  general and administrative costs before the reorganization  the effect of strengthening of the canadian dollar on foreign currency translation  which resulted in a million increase in operating expenses related to our canadian operations  an increase in fuel costs of approximately million  an average increase of per gallon  increases in subcontractor costs of approximately million due to i the redirection of waste as a result of landfill constraints primarily in the eastern portion of the united states  ii increases in subcontracted transportation costs from an increase in special waste activity within our landfill line of business  iii general volume increases and iv increased use of subcontractors for our national accounts in areas where we do not provide services  increased landfill and environmental costs of approximately million primarily due to increases in costs associated with accretion expense on landfill asset retirement obligations related to our adoption of sfas no 
in  increased risk management expenses of approximately million as a result of increases in the average cost per claim and higher financial assurance costs  and increased repair and maintenance costs of approximately million  which is mostly from changes in the timing and scope of certain maintenance projects at our waste to energy facilities 
business acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the increases discussed above 
for the year ended december   operating costs and expenses were million higher than the prior year period  representing an increase of 
as a percentage of operating revenue  operating costs and expenses were for the year ended december   which is a percentage point increase from the prior year period 
the increase was generally due to a re characterization of certain costs that were reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in prior periods due to changes in certain roles and responsibilities as a result of our march reorganization  increases in disposal and subcontractor costs 
disposal cost increases were primarily related to increased taxes on the disposal of waste in pennsylvania  which were partially offset by decreases in disposal costs due to declines in volumes in subcontractor cost increases included increased utilization of subcontractors for certain of our national account customers in areas where we do not provide services and increased use of third party transportation of waste to disposal facilities  annual merit increases and other employee benefit cost increases  higher costs associated with recycling commodities due primarily to an increase in market prices for occ and onp  which resulted in increased rebates paid to customers  and the recovery of claims against insurers for the reimbursement of environmental expenses recorded in as an offset to operating costs and expenses 
these increases in operating costs and expenses were offset by headcount reductions as a result of the march reorganization and divestitures of our international operations in and the non solid waste operations in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include management salaries  clerical and administrative costs  marketing costs  professional services  facility rentals  provision for doubtful accounts and related insurance costs  as well as costs related to our sales force and customer service 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  as compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  the decrease was percentage points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease was generally due to the re characterization of costs related principally to employee costs and facility related expenses  including property taxes  utilities  and risk management expenses  that have been reflected as operating costs since april   as discussed above in operating costs and expenses  cost savings of approximately million through reductions in salary and other labor related costs as a result of our march reorganization and february and june restructurings  a reduction of over million in costs due to management s focus on reducing spending related to professional fees  supplies  travel and entertainment and other administrative costs  and favorable settlements of legal disputes in in addition to the unfavorable impact of increases in legal reserves in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to is primarily attributable to management s focus on reducing spending related to professional fees  travel and entertainment  and other administrative costs  headcount reductions and the re characterization of certain expenses as costs of operations as a result of the march restructuring  and divestitures of international and non solid waste operations in and in early these reductions were offset partially by increased costs associated with litigation settlements  higher bad debt expense largely attributable to the weaker economy  workers compensation costs  and property related costs such as property taxes  maintenance and security 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes i amortization of intangible assets with a definite life primarily on a straight line basis over the definitive terms of the related agreements generally from to years  ii depreciation of property and equipment on a straight line basis from to years  iii amortization of landfill costs  including those incurred and all estimated future costs for landfill development  construction  closure and post closure  on a units of consumption method as landfill airspace is consumed over the estimated remaining capacity of a site  and iv as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
 amortization of landfill asset retirement costs arising from final capping obligations on a units of consumption method as airspace is consumed over the estimated capacity associated with each final capping event 
as a percentage of operating revenues  depreciation and amortization expense was in  in and in depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat from to even after considering the effect of the accounting changes that resulted from our adoption of sfas no 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in is primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas no 
 which required that the amortization of all goodwill cease on january  goodwill amortization for was million  or of operating revenues 
excluding the effect of goodwill amortization expense in  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased from to the following schedule reflects the adjusted net income excluding goodwill and negative goodwill amortization as compared to the results of operations for december  and in millions  except per share amounts

as part of the restructuring  we reduced the number of field layers of management and eliminated approximately  field level administrative and operational positions 
in  we recorded million in pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure 
these charges included million for employee severance and benefit costs and million related to abandoned operating lease agreements 
in february  we reduced the number of market areas that make up our geographic operating groups to from at december   and reduced certain overhead positions to further streamline our organization 
management believes that this structure results in a more effective utilization of resources and enables us to serve our customers more efficiently 
in connection with these restructuring efforts  we reduced our workforce by about employees and contract workers 
we recorded million of pre tax charges for costs associated with the implementation of the new structure  all of which was associated with employee severance and benefit costs 
the operational efficiencies provided by these organizational changes and a focus on fully utilizing the capabilities of our information technology resources enabled us to further reduce our workforce in june this workforce reduction resulted in the elimination of employee positions and contract worker positions 
we recorded million of pre tax charges for employee severance and benefit costs associated with this workforce reduction 
as of december   approximately million remains accrued for employee severance and benefit costs incurred as a result of these workforce reductions 
our obligations for the accrued severance payments continue through the third quarter of asset impairments and unusual items during  we recorded a net gain of million to asset impairments and unusual items primarily as a result of gains of million recognized on divestitures of certain operations that were offset  in part  by million for asset impairment and other miscellaneous charges 
in  the net gain for asset impairments and unusual items was due primarily to i our receipt of approximately million related to a previously impaired  non revenue producing asset  ii net gains of approximately million on divestitures during the year and iii reductions to legal reserves of approximately million and loss contract reserves of approximately million that we deemed were in excess of current requirements and that were initially recognized as a charge to asset impairments and unusual items 
in  the expense was comprised mainly of a charge of million  which is net of the recovery from our insurers and the stockholders derivative suit against our former independent public accountant  arthur andersen llp  for the settlement reached in connection with the stockholder class action lawsuit filed against us in july alleging violations of the federal securities laws 
the final net cash settlement payment of million  which is the amount provided by the settlement agreement plus accrued interest less our recoveries  was made in the third quarter of additionally in  we recorded a held for sale adjustment of approximately million related to our international operations along with a held for sale adjustment for an investment in mexican solid waste operations of approximately million 
offsetting these expenses was a net gain of million comprised of the reversal of the held for sale impairment of million and a held for use impairment of million from our decision during the third quarter of not to sell all but one of our independent power production plants  and the reclassification in the third quarter of of all but one of those plants from held for sale to held for use 
also included in asset impairments and unusual items for were reversals of certain loss contract reserves of million that we determined to be in excess of current requirements 
interest expense our interest expense decreased consistently each year from to the decrease in interest expense is partially attributable to our increased utilization of tax exempt financing  which has resulted in a decline in our weighted average interest rate 
the remaining decrease in interest expense from to is attributable to the overall positive impact of our interest rate derivative contracts  which are used to manage our interest rate exposure  and the general decline in interest rates 
interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by million in  million in and million in other income we experienced a significant impact to other income in as compared to other years due primarily to the sale of an equity investment 
in  a company in which we held an approximately interest was acquired by another entity 
we also held a note from the acquired company that was paid off in connection with the acquisition 
the proceeds from the repayment of the note and the sale of our equity investment resulted in a gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for  million for and million for resulting in an effective income tax rate of   and for each of the three years  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for and is primarily due to state and local income taxes  offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits 
additionally  in we recognized a million tax benefit on the settlement of certain foreign audits 
in we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million due to a capital gain generated in that enabled us to utilize a previously unbenefitted capital loss that arose from a divestiture 
a tax benefit of approximately million was also recognized in related to the carry back of losses by our dutch subsidiary 
the difference in federal income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and reported income taxes for is primarily due to state and local income taxes  non deductible costs associated with the impairment of certain businesses  the cost associated with remitting the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that are no longer permanently reinvested  offset in part by non conventional fuel tax credits 
additionally  in scheduled canadian federal and provincial tax rate reductions resulted in a benefit of million  which was offset in part by a tax expense of million related to our plan to repatriate certain capital and earnings previously deemed permanently invested in canada 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in the first and fourth quarters of  we recorded net of tax charges of million and million  respectively  to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the initial adoption of the accounting changes described below 
through december   we accrued in advance for major repairs and maintenance expenditures and deferred costs associated with annual plant outages at our waste to energy facilities and independent power production plants 
effective january   we changed our policy from this method to one that expenses these costs as they are incurred 
we recorded approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
through december   we accrued for future losses under customer contracts that we entered into that over the contract life were projected to have direct costs greater than revenues 
effective january   we recorded approximately million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  as a credit to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded approximately million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the first quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
substantially all of this charge was related to the impact of changes in accounting for landfill final capping  closure and post closure costs 
in connection with the application of fin to special purpose type variable interest entities  we recorded approximately million  including tax benefit  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of as a charge to cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles 
for a discussion of these variable interest entities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a credit of million to cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to write off the aggregate amount of negative goodwill as a result of adopting sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations 
in the first quarter of  adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  resulted in a gain  net of tax  of approximately million 
income from operations by reportable segment we manage and evaluate our operations primarily through our eastern  midwest  southern  western  canadian  wheelabrator and recycling groups 
these groups  when combined with certain other operations  comprise our north american solid waste  or nasw  operations 
the operations not managed through our seven operating groups are presented herein as other nasw 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our restructuring and workforce reductions have impacted the operating results of our reportable segments in and the following table summarizes income from operations by reportable segment for the years ended december   and and provides explanations of other factors contributing to the significant changes in our segments operating results in millions 
years ended december  canadian a a eastern b midwest southern western c wheelabrator recycling other nasw d total nasw a a favorable legal settlement of million in the fourth quarter of and an unfavorable legal settlement of million in were the primary drivers of the increase in income from operations as compared with the unfavorable legal settlement also had a significant effect on the comparability of and income from operations for our canadian group 
b the most significant factors that affected the eastern group s operating income were i lower collection and landfill volumes  ii increased disposal costs largely due to disposal constraints in the northeastern portion of the united states  iii general increases in landfill operating costs and repair and maintenance costs and iv harsh winter weather experienced during the first quarter of c the landfill line of business was the primary driver of the decline in income from operations as compared with specifically  the western group s landfill volumes were significantly affected by i volume constraints in the los angeles market and ii volume declines at industrial landfills associated with the economic downturn in the western region of the united states that began in the second half of and continued throughout and into d other nasw includes operations provided throughout our operating groups for methane gas recovery and certain third party sub contract and administrative revenues managed by our national accounts function 
also included are certain year end adjustments related to the reportable segments that are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss used to assess their individual group performance for the periods disclosed 
the decline in income from operations was driven in part by increased costs associated with our national accounts function  primarily due to credit adjustments for bad debt and loss contract reserves  and in part by the effect of unfavorable year end adjustments and favorable year end adjustments related to the reportable segments 
liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit  certificates of deposit  money market accounts  and investment grade commercial paper purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
we generated cash flows from operations of approximately billion in  which included approximately million received for the fair value of interest rate swap agreements terminated prior to their scheduled maturities 
also included as a component of cash flows from operations is a net cash outflow of approximately million associated with the final settlement of our securities class action lawsuit  which occurred during the third quarter 
settlement related activity impacting our operating cash flows during the year includes i a final net cash settlement payment of approximately million associated with the settlement agreement of a shareholder class action suit plus accrued interest  ii utilization of insurance proceeds of approximately million to settle the remaining portion of the settlement  iii a total tax benefit of approximately million  of which we realized million in the second quarter and million in each of the third and fourth quarters and iv related net settlement recoveries of approximately million 
during we used billion for investing activities  consisting of billion for capital expenditures and million for the acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired  which were offset by net receipts of million from restricted funds and proceeds from divestitures of businesses  net of cash divested  and other asset sales and other items of million 
additionally  we used billion for financing activities  which consisted primarily of the repurchase of shares of our common stock for million and net debt reductions of million 
our cash balances decreased by million from december  to december  this decrease is primarily attributable to capital expenditures  our stock repurchase program and the repayment of portions of our senior note issuances prior to their maturity dates 
in  cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by million for cash received from counterparties for certain interest rate swap agreements that we terminated prior to the scheduled maturities  offset by cash paid of million to counterparties for the settlement of hedging agreements entered into to secure underlying interest rates related to our debt issuances 
included in our investing activities was cash paid of billion for capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds of million from other investing activities  primarily proceeds from sales of assets and net cash receipts from restricted funds 
included in our financing activities was cash paid of million for the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
in addition  we paid million for net debt reductions and received million from exercises of common stock options and warrants 
in  we generated cash flows from operations of approximately billion 
favorably impacting cash flows from operations was cash received of million for the settlement of environmental related claims that we had against certain insurance carriers and million that we received from counterparties when we terminated certain interest rate swap agreements prior to the scheduled maturities 
included in our investing activities was billion of capital expenditures and million for acquisitions of solid waste businesses 
these expenditures were offset by proceeds from sales of assets and other investing activities of million 
in addition  we used million for financing activities  which is comprised of million of net debt reductions and million of other financing activities  offset by proceeds of million from exercises of common stock options and warrants 
we operate in a capital intensive business and continuing access to various financing sources is vital to our operations 
in the past  we have been successful in obtaining financing from a variety of sources on terms we consider attractive 
based on several key factors we believe considered by credit rating agencies and financial markets to be important in determining our future access to financing  we expect to continue to maintain access to capital sources in the future 
these factors include the essential nature of the services we provide and our large and diverse customer base  our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flows despite the economic environment  our liquidity profile  our asset base  and our commitment to maintaining a moderate financial profile and disciplined capital allocation 
in addition to our working capital needs for ongoing operations  we have capital requirements for i capital expenditures for construction and expansion of landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for collection and other operations  ii refurbishments and improvements at waste to energy facilities and iii business acquisitions 
for  we currently expect to spend approximately billion to billion for capital expenditures and approximately million for acquisitions 
in february  we announced that our board of directors had approved a stock repurchase program for up to billion in annual repurchases for each year through  to be implemented at management s discretion 
share repurchases in were less than the billion allowed because we used funds that would have otherwise been available for this program to settle our securities class action lawsuit and for our acquisition program 
we expect to utilize cash flows from operations for purchases made in either open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the following is a summary of activity to date for our stock repurchase program in millions  except shares in thousands and price per share in dollars 
agreement common stock total net common purchase settlement stock transaction type initiating date settlement date shares price price received paid repurchases private accelerated purchase a march august  b private accelerated purchase a december february  c private accelerated purchase a march may  d open market purchases e n a n a   n a  a we accounted for the initial payments as a purchase of treasury stock and classified the future settlements with the counterparty as an equity instrument because we had the option under these agreements to settle our obligations  if any  in shares of our common stock 
b the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately million less than the approximately million we initially paid 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  the counterparty paid us this difference of approximately million at the end of the valuation period  which occurred during the third quarter of  to settle the agreement 
we accounted for the cash receipt as an adjustment to the carrying value of treasury stock and have therefore included it in common stock repurchases within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
c the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately million less than the approximately million we initially paid 
pursuant to the agreement  the counterparty paid us the difference of approximately million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement 
d the weighted average daily market price of our stock during the valuation period times the number of shares we purchased was approximately million more than the approximately million we initially paid 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid the counterparty the difference of approximately million at the end of the valuation period to settle the agreement 
e during we purchased million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately million 
during we purchased million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for approximately million 
we engaged in these purchases when trading was allowed pursuant to law and our insider trading policy 
in august  we announced that the board of directors approved a quarterly dividend program beginning in it is expected that the dividend will be per share per quarter  or per share annually 
the first quarterly dividend of per share will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  our dividend payments are expected to result in a cash outlay of approximately million 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years in millions thereafter total recorded obligations expected environmental liabilities a final capping  closure and post closure environmental remediation debt payments b c   unrecorded obligations d non cancelable operating lease obligations e unconditional purchase obligations f anticipated liquidity impact as of december  a environmental liabilities include final capping  closure  post closure and environmental remediation costs 
the amounts included here reflect environmental liabilities recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  without the impact of discounting and inflation 
the environmental liabilities included in our balance sheet at december  are based upon the estimated fair value of the final capping  closure and post closure obligations associated with the airspace capacity that has been consumed at our landfills through the end of the reporting period and our estimates of probable environmental remediation obligations 
our recorded environmental liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional tons within the permitted airspace at our landfills 
b related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule 
our interest payments are expected to be approximately million 
additionally  we use interest rate derivatives to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for disclosure associated with the terms of these instruments 
c we have million of debt obligations with contractual maturities on or before december  this includes million of senior notes due april   million of senior notes due may  and million of senior notes due october  we have classified million of these debt obligations as long term at december  because we have the intent and ability to refinance these obligations with long term debt instruments 
classified as a current obligation at december  is million of fixed rate tax exempt bonds subject to repricing within the next twelve months  which is prior to their scheduled maturities 
if the reoffering of the bonds is unsuccessful  then the bonds can be put to us 
these bonds are not backed by letters of credit that would serve to guarantee repayment in the event of a failed offering 
d our unrecorded obligations represent operating lease obligations and purchase commitments from which we expect to realize an economic benefit in future periods 
we have also made certain guarantees  as discussed in note  that we do not expect to materially affect our current or future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
e included in our non cancelable operating lease obligations are minimum rent payments for two of our waste to energy facilities that are required under leasing arrangements that we have with unconsolidated variable interest entities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the terms of these lease agreements 
our commitments under these lease arrangements do not materially impact our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
f see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the nature and terms of our unconditional purchase obligations 
we have contingencies that are deemed not reasonably likely and thus not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations 
however  we also have bank borrowings available to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations and  when appropriate  will obtain financing by issuing debt or common stock 
as of december   we had a three year  million syndicated revolving credit facility and a five year  billion syndicated revolving credit facility 
the three year revolver matures in june and the five year revolver matures in june at december   no borrowings were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and we had unused and available credit capacity under these facilities of approximately million 
as of december   we are required to maintain the following financial covenants under our revolving credit facilities i an interest coverage ratio  ii total debt to ebitda ratio  and iii minimum net worth  all as defined in the credit facilities solely for the purpose of determining compliance with the covenants 
the interest coverage ratio requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter we will not permit the ratio of a our consolidated net income plus interest expense and income taxes ebit for the four fiscal quarters then ending to b consolidated total interest expense for such period  to be less than to the total debt to ebitda covenant requires that at the end of any fiscal quarter  we will not permit the ratio of a all indebtedness and certain contingent liabilities such as financial guarantees to b ebit plus depreciation and amortization expense ebitda for the four fiscal quarters then ending to exceed to our minimum net worth covenant restricts us from allowing stockholders equity to be less than billion plus of our cumulative consolidated net income for each fiscal quarter  beginning with the first fiscal quarter ended march  the credit facilities requiring compliance with these financial covenants state that the calculations must be based on generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by the financial accounting standards board and applied by us during the latest fiscal year before the date of the facilities  or december  and therefore  our adoption or implementation of accounting pronouncements or interpretations effective after those dates does not impact the calculation of the financial covenants defined above 
we are in compliance with all covenants under our revolving credit facilities and all other debt instruments 
we have increased our utilization of tax exempt financing and plan to continue this trend due to the attractive rates offered for these instruments 
as such  we continue to assess our financial assurance and letter of credit requirements and expect that we will arrange additional long term letter of credit and or surety bond capacity in advance of our business requirements 
we have issued tax exempt bonds primarily for the construction of collection and disposal facilities 
proceeds from these financing arrangements are directly deposited into trust funds and we do not have the ability to utilize the funds in regular operating activities 
accordingly  we report these amounts as an investing activity when the cash is released from the trust funds and a financing activity when the industrial revenue bonds are repaid 
at december   approximately million of funds were held in trust to meet future capital expenditures at various facilities 
these fund balances are included as other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
historically  proceeds from the issuance of tax exempt bonds held in trust funds have been invested in cash and cash equivalents 
beginning in the fourth quarter of we determined that it would be beneficial to invest these funds in longer term  higher yield debt instruments 
as of december   million of our trust fund assets funded by tax exempt bonds and held for future capital expenditures were invested in us government agency debt securities with maturities ranging from less than one year to three years 
we manage the interest rate risk of our debt portfolio principally by using interest rate derivatives to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt  which was approximately fixed and floating at december  in addition  we use variable rate tax exempt financings and periodically enter into derivative transactions to secure the then current market interest rate in anticipation of senior debt issuances 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to i lease agreements with unconsolidated variable interest entities as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  ii product and service purchase commitments as discussed in the other long term commitments section of note to the consolidated financial statements and iii guarantee arrangements with unconsolidated entities as discussed in the guarantees section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements and purchase commitments are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities  products and services at competitive  market driven prices 
our third party guarantee arrangements are generally established to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the period ended december  nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
seasonal trends and inflation our operating revenues tend to be somewhat lower in the winter months  primarily due to the lower volume of construction and demolition waste 
the volumes of industrial and residential waste in certain regions where we operate also tend to decrease during the winter months 
our first and fourth quarter results of operations typically reflect these seasonal trends 
we also use the slower winter months for scheduled maintenance at our waste to energy facilities  so repair and maintenance expense is generally higher in our first quarter than in other quarters during the year 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of certain of our operations 
we believe that inflation has not had  and in the near future is not expected to have  any material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  management s estimates associated with inflation have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements information regarding our assessment of new accounting pronouncements can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and certain commodity prices 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount  with no multipliers or leverage 
as of december   all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions  with the exception of certain derivatives related to the fiber commodity markets that were entered into for trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by our derivative counterparties 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and our rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations  which are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to either lock in or limit the variability in the interest rates to manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt obligations 
an instantaneous  one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and applicable yield curves would increase the fair value of our combined debt and interest rate swap positions at both december  and by approximately million 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings  nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
since a significant portion of our debt is at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates would not significantly impact operating results until and unless our fixed rate debt would need to be refinanced at maturity 
we are also exposed to interest rate market risk because we have approximately million of restricted funds held in trust funds and escrow accounts included as a component of other long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
these funds are generally restricted for future capital expenditures and closure  post closure and remedial activities at our disposal facilities and are therefore invested in high quality  liquid instruments including money market accounts and us government agency debt securities 
because of the short terms of these investments  we believe that our exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant 
currency rate exposure 
from time to time  we have used foreign currency derivatives to mitigate the impact of currency translation on cash flows on intercompany foreign currency denominated debt 
there would be no material impact if there were an instantaneous decrease in foreign exchange rates at either december  or december  commodities price exposure 
we market recycled waste paper products such as onp and occ from our material recovery facilities 
we enter into financial fiber swaps to mitigate the variability in cash flows from a portion of these sales 
under these swap agreements  we pay a floating index price and receive a fixed price for a fixed period of time 
we record changes in the fair value of these fiber swap agreements not designated as hedges immediately to earnings 
all derivative transactions are subject to our risk management policy which governs the type of instruments that may be used and our risk exposure limits 
an instantaneous increase in occ and onp prices would decrease the fair value of our hedges by approximately million on both december  and this analysis excludes the underlying physical commodity sales positions that are being hedged 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the use of and accounting for derivative instruments
