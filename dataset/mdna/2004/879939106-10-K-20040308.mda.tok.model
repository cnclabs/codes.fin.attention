item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we serve our clients through two primary businesses i customer management services  which provides outsourced customer support and marketing services for a variety of industries via call centers customer management centers  or cmcs throughout the world  and ii database marketing and consulting 
we separate our customer management services business into two segments consistent with our management of the business  which generally reflects the internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
north american customer care consists of customer management services provided to united states and canadian clients while international customer care consists of clients in all other countries 
database marketing and consulting provides outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
segment accounting policies are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding preparation of segment information 
customer management services the customer management services segment generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our representatives devote to a client s program 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is  and we anticipate that the majority of our future revenue will continue to be  from multi year contracts 
however  we do provide some programs on a short term basis and our operations outside of north america are characterized by shorter term contracts 
additionally  we typically experience client attrition of approximately to of our revenue each year 
our invoice terms with customers range from days to days  excluding longer terms in europe and prepay arrangements 
we compete primarily with the in house customer management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide customer management services on an outsourced basis 
over the last several years  the global economy has had a negative impact on the customer care management market 
more specifically  sales cycles have lengthened  competition has increased  and contract values have been reduced 
our revenue growth has been significantly impacted by the lengthening sales cycles and we have encountered delays in the closing of new sales opportunities for large client programs during and however  during the first quarter of  we launched a significant new client contract  which led to an increase in our revenue from the year ended december  to as discussed under client concentrations on page  north american customer care revenue in includes million of revenue associated with a certain client that is expected to be reduced to million in without a corresponding decrease in cost of sales 
the short term focus of management is to increase revenue by selling new business to existing customers  continuing to focus sales efforts on large  complex  multi center opportunities  and differentiating our products and services by developing and offering new solutions to clients 
our ability to enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our customers are operating 
a weakening of the us and or global economy could further lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our cmcs  the number of new or expanded programs during a period and our success at managing personnel turnover and employee costs 
managing our costs is critical since we continue to see pricing pressure within our industry 
the pricing pressures have been exacerbated by the rapid growth of offshore labor 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new cmcs or the expansion of existing cmcs 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations or expansions of existing programs  and the size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
however  to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  implement new programs and expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a contract as we continue to concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining larger  more complex  customer management programs 
we target capacity utilization in our fully outsourced centers at  up from a previous target of  of our available workstations during the weekday period 
as of december   capacity utilization in our multi client centers was 
our profitability is also influenced by the number of new or expanded client programs 
as required by the adoption of eitf for contracts entered into after july  see critical accounting policies for further discussion  in the event that a client may be billed for direct start up costs  the associated revenue and costs are to be deferred and recognized straight line over the life of the contract 
in the event that a client cannot be billed for direct start up costs  then those start up costs are to be expensed when incurred 
we strive to enter contracts where our clients pay separately for start up costs as opposed to incorporating them into the ongoing production rate 
in the fourth quarter  we implemented multiple programs where the client was billed for direct start up costs 
as a result  our fourth quarter revenue and income from operations decreased by million and million  respectively 
our industry is very labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  costs of employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our cmcs are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs  and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
our success in improving our profitability will depend on successful execution of a comprehensive business plan  including the following steps increasing sales to absorb unused capacity in existing global cmcs  reducing costs and continued focus on cost controls  and effectively managing our workforce in domestic and international cmcs 
database marketing and consulting the database marketing and consulting segment has contracts with over  automobile dealers representing different brand names 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from twelve to twenty four months 
for a few major automotive manufacturers  the automotive manufacturer collects from the individual automobile dealers on our behalf 
our average collection period is to days 
revenue from this segment is generated primarily from direct marketing campaigns involving direct mailing and outbound teleservice follow up to promote automobile service business from a dealership s own customer base 
this segment has experienced year over year revenue growth through expansion to additional automobile dealers and additional products 
however  due to a combination of factors  both internal and external such as client renewals and new product launch costs  we are currently forecasting a material decline in operating income in this segment in  even after a reduction in force that occurred in the first quarter of to offset this decline  we plan to expedite the entry of new products and will continue to look for ways to reduce costs 
we plan to focus on the following in continue to increase revenue by expanding our offerings  diversifying our customer base by establishing relations with dealer groups and non current customer automotive manufacturers  and continuing to drive cost reductions through a combination of reductions in force and operational effectiveness 
fourth quarter adjustments in the fourth quarter of  we made numerous adjustments 
we reversed the remaining million of bonus accruals that had been previously recorded during following the decision that only the contractual minimum required bonuses would be paid due to lower than expected operating results 
we recorded an additional million of income tax expense related to prior periods 
we completed an analysis of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets in brazil and based upon our evaluation of positive and negative evidence  along with forecasted taxable income loss over the next three years  we determined to establish a valuation allowance of million 
also  we deferred million in revenue and million in income from operations as a result of the adoption of eitf see critical account policies 
overall because of the following factors  we expect approximately break even results for the first quarter of minimum commitments from verizon communications verizon are declining as described under client concentrations  we continue to invest in our sales development efforts  our plans to improve individual program profitability have not been fully implemented  and further reductions in force will require severance payments 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business and results of operations 
for further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies  certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
descriptions of these critical accounting policies follow revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
our customer management services business recognizes revenue under production rate and performance based models  which are production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable hours or minutes of each csr as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable hour or minute is based on a predetermined contractual rate  as agreed in the underlying contract 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
the impact on the rate is continually updated as revenue is recognized 
additionally  some clients are contractually entitled to penalties when we are out of compliance with certain obligations as defined in the client contract 
such penalties are recorded as a reduction to revenue as incurred based on a measurement of our obligation under the terms of the client contract 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our customers based on achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue 
we have certain contracts that are billed in advance 
accordingly  amounts billed but not earned under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in customer advances and deferred income 
in july  we adopted emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  providing further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
eitf is effective for all arrangements entered into after the second quarter of we have determined that eitf requires the deferral of revenue for the initial training that occurs upon commencement of a new client contract start up training if that training is billed separately to a client 
accordingly  the corresponding training costs  consisting primarily of labor and related expenses  are also deferred 
in these circumstances  both the training revenue and costs will be amortized straight line over the life of the client contract 
in situations where start up training is not billed separately  but rather included in the production rates paid by the client over the life of the contract  no deferral is necessary as the revenue is recognized over the life of the contract 
if start up training revenue is not deferred  the associated training expenses will be expensed as incurred 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our operating results for the year ended december  however  the adoption of eitf decreased our fourth quarter sales and income from operations by million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
management judgment has been used in forecasting future taxable income 
during the second quarter of  we updated our analysis of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset due to a change in facts and circumstances 
while the company had reported net losses during and  we believed the net losses were primarily due to site closures  restructurings and adjusting assets to their net realizable value  and that operating results were profitable without such charges 
further  we expected and future operations to return to profitability 
during the second quarter of  we again incurred a net loss 
the net loss was the result of both core operating results along with charges for site closures  restructurings and asset recoverability 
these represented a different set of facts and circumstances from the end of and  accordingly  we determined that it was appropriate under those circumstances to record a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax asset 
sfas provides for the weighing of positive and negative evidence in determining whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is recoverable 
we prepared a forecast of future taxable income  including domestic and international operating results and the reversal of existing temporary differences between income recognized under generally accepted accounting principles and income for federal income tax reporting purposes 
relevant accounting guidance suggests that a recent history of cumulative losses constitutes significant negative evidence  and that future expectations about taxable income are overshadowed by such recent losses 
accordingly  the expectations of future taxable income would generally be limited to no more than two or three years for generating sufficient income to recover deferred tax assets 
based on our evaluation of positive and negative evidence  along with forecasted taxable income loss over the next two to three years  management determined to increase the valuation allowance by million 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed an analysis of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets in brazil 
based upon our evaluation of positive and negative evidence  along with forecasted taxable income loss over the next three years  we determined to establish a valuation allowance of million 
we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets related to certain international countries whose recoverability is dependent upon future profitability 
we reviewed the net deferred tax assets in mexico of million  the majority of which are related to net operating loss carryforwards  to determine whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
over the last six months  management in mexico has materially reduced the operating costs in mexico through reductions in force and other cost cutting measures  added new management  eliminated unprofitable client programs and added what we believe to be more profitable client programs 
based upon our cash flow projections  we determined it was not appropriate to record a deferred tax valuation allowance for mexico as of december  goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on reporting units one level below the segment level for the company 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises prior to the fourth quarter 
the most significant assumptions used in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services and projected labor costs 
we then use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
if future actual results prove the assumptions used in performing the impairment test were wrong  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
based on the testing performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balance of million 
if projected revenue used in the analysis of goodwill was less than forecast the projections assumed revenue growth rates ranging from to per annum over a three year period  there would still be no impairment to goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in january  we recorded a transitional impairment charge of approximately million to write off the goodwill of our latin america reporting unit 
restructuring liability 
we periodically assess the profitability and utilization of our cmcs along with our overall profitability 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing centers and make reductions in force to enhance future profitability 
in and  under the previous accounting guidance  we recorded the anticipated charges at the time a plan was approved by management or the board of directors and various other criteria were met 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of estimated liability for closing cmcs is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on a third party broker s assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the premises 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a future gain  in our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations related to revising estimated restructuring liabilities 
as of december   we have accrued million of estimated restructuring liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of activity in the restructuring liability reserve 
impairment of long lived assets 
during the year  we evaluate the carrying value of our individual cmcs in accordance with sfas no 
to evaluate whether future operating results are sufficient to recover the carrying costs of the long lived assets 
when the operating results of a center have reasonably progressed to a point making it likely that the site will continue to sustain losses in the future  or there is a current expectation that a cmc will be closed or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life  we select the center for further review 
for cmcs selected for further review  we estimate the probability weighted future cash flows from operating the center over its useful life 
significant judgment is involved in projecting future capacity utilization  pricing  labor costs and the estimated useful life of the center 
additionally  we do not test cmcs that have been operated for less than two years or those centers that have been impaired within the past two years the two year rule 
we believe a sufficient time to establish market presence and build a customer base is required for new centers in order to determine recoverability and meet the two year rule 
however  the centers are nonetheless evaluated in case other factors would indicate an impairment in value 
for recently impaired centers  we write the assets down to estimated fair market value 
if the assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair value estimate of the cmcs may be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
during  we determined that two of our cmcs would not generate sufficient undiscounted cash flows to recover the net book value of our assets 
during the second quarter of  we determined to close the kansas city center upon expiration of the work being performed for the united states postal service 
accordingly  the projections for that location indicated that an impairment exists 
additionally  we determined that an impairment existed for our mexico city location 
as a result  our north american and international customer care segments recorded charges of approximately million and million  respectively  to reduce the net book value of their long lived assets to net realizable value 
a sensitivity analysis of the impairment demonstrated that if revenue was less than projected in the probability weighted projection scenarios that had annual revenue growth rates ranging from to based on management expectations and available capacity and the margin held constant  the impairment loss would have been approximately million greater 
the following table summarizes the sensitivity analysis we performed during the fourth quarter of dollars in thousands net book value number of cmcs impairment under sensitivity test tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period  negative cash flow in period   not tested based on two year rule positive cash flow in period  negative cash flow in period   total positive cash flow in period  negative cash flow in period   additionally  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  contains a broadened definition of discontinued operations 
under sfas no 
 under certain circumstances  closing a center could result in discontinued operations classification  which would result in restating prior period results 
estimated sales and use tax liability 
we have received inquiries from several states regarding the applicability of sales or use taxes on our services primarily provided by our database marketing and consulting segment 
we are working with the inquiring states to determine what liability exists  if any  in each respective state 
in addition to the inquiring states  we have initiated a self assessment to determine whether sales or use taxes are applicable in each state in which our database marketing and consulting segment does business 
sales and use tax laws are complex and vary by state 
we have determined that sales or use tax applies in certain states to our products and services of our database marketing and consulting segment 
while we cannot quantify the ultimate liability that will be owed  we recorded in approximately million of use tax expense for what we believe to be the minimum liability that will be owed  net of receipts from customers 
as we progress in our assessment and dealings with the various states  we will update this estimated liability and record charges to operations  if any  when such amounts become both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  we do not expect the outcome to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
with regards to the north american customer care segment  we have not determined whether sales or use tax applies to our services 
if we determine sales tax does apply  our contracts generally provide for such taxes to be passed on to the client 
however  no assurance can be given that we would be successful in passing on past or future taxes to our clients  and accordingly  it could impact our future results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment are the age of the identified receivable  client financial wherewithal  previous client history and any recent communications with the client

our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
total production workstations in use in use total production workstations in use in use due to the inbound nature of our business  we experience significantly higher capacity utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we may be required to open or expand cmcs to create the additional peak period capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded customer management programs 
the opening or expansion of a cmc may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity during peak periods until any new or expanded program is implemented fully 
versus revenues 
the decrease in north american customer care revenue between periods was driven primarily by the ramp down of the united states postal service usps contract during  as well as the ramp down or no longer having approximately eleven multi client center programs  primarily in the communications sector 
several of the multi center programs were temporary in nature and ended during the first quarter of the decrease in north american customer care revenue was also caused by a lack of new business 
we typically churn approximately to of our revenue each year 
historically  we have signed a sufficient amount of new business  or grown existing customer business  to more than offset the normal churn 
however  over the past several years  we have experienced longer sales cycles  which we attribute to the downturn in the global economy 
recently  we have noted an increase in new contract activity 
while our strategy is to differentiate ourselves by focusing on complex engagements and offering value added solutions  there is no assurance that we will be successful in winning new business or mitigate future price decreases with this strategy 
the increase in international customer care revenue between periods is the net result of increases in europe and asia pacific offset by decreases in latin america 
the increase in asia pacific is primarily due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
approximately half of the increase in europe was driven by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the remainder of the increase is in spain and resulted from the combination of an increase in an existing client program along with a new short term project that was completed in june latin american revenue decreased primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a decrease in revenue in mexico 
mexico s revenue decreased primarily due to no longer having several profitable client programs offset by an increase in revenue due to an accounting treatment change related to the adoption of eitf  reporting revenue gross as principal versus net as an agent and eitf  income characterization of reimbursement received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
toward the end of  we launched several new client programs  which are expected to increase revenue in we are evaluating unprofitable client programs  and if we exit these programs  our revenue could decrease 
database marketing and consulting revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the customer base as well as increased sales to existing customers 
costs of services 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care is comparable between periods 
the loss of usps caused an increase in the cost of services as a percentage of revenue  but this was offset by improvement in margins of other programs 
we are taking additional steps to reduce our costs of services as a percentage of revenue for all programs in our north american customer care segment including enhancing our timekeeping and workforce management systems and other actions to improve program profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
the increase in costs of services as a percentage of revenue in international customer care between periods is consistent in all regions 
the degradation in latin america is primarily due to mexico 
the mexico degradation was primarily caused by no longer having several profitable programs  a more competitive local market and an increase of costs related to adopting eitf and eitf as discussed above 
the degradation in asia pacific is primarily the result of pricing and performance issues with a certain client program in australia 
in the fourth quarter of  we renegotiated the terms of this contract and  as a result  we expect the profitability to improve 
europe costs as a percentage of revenue increased between periods primarily as the result of an increase in the united kingdom uk offset in part by improvements in spain 
the increase in costs of services as a percentage of revenue in the uk is the result of a movement from higher margin inbound work to lower margin outbound work 
spain improved primarily as the result of terminating several unprofitable contracts during the second quarter of because of the continued high costs of services in certain locations  we took actions to reduce the costs of services in the uk  spain  mexico and asia pacific through reductions in force 
the reductions in force were mostly completed by the end of february approximately million of the restructuring expense was recorded in the fourth quarter of  but an additional million will be recorded in the first quarter of costs of services as a percentage of revenue for database marketing and consulting is comparable between periods 
however  in order to reduce the impact on margins discussed above  we have recently taken action to reduce the costs of services through a reduction in force  which will result in restructuring expense of approximately million in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care is primarily due to the decrease in revenue between periods as a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses are comparable between periods 
increases in salaries and related benefits due to headcount additions were offset by a decrease in bonus expense 
in the prior year  bonuses were accrued and in the first quarter of  we reversed million to reduce the total balance to the actual amount paid 
north american customer care represents the majority 
we will not pay bonuses to middle and executive management for results  except where required under our guidelines or employment agreements and therefore  we reversed million of bonus expense in the fourth quarter of approximately million is in database marketing and consulting 
in the fourth quarter of  we also wrote off a note receivable of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for international customer care decreased as a percentage of revenue due to the increase in revenue between periods as a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
in absolute dollars  the increase between periods was due to increases in asia pacific and latin america offset by decreases in the uk 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates were a significant contributor to the increase in asia pacific expenses 
latin american increases were caused by increases in payroll and related expenses  bad debt expense  telecommunications and occupancy costs 
in june  we reduced administrative headcount in mexico by  which decreased the payroll and related expenses from the first half of the year to the second half of the year 
the decreases in the uk were caused by reductions in bad debt expense as costs included an allowance for a client receivable that was written off in as previously discussed  all of these regions recently have taken action to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in database marketing and consulting was caused primarily by an increase in payroll and related expenses  commissions due to increased sales and the accrual for sales and use tax of million as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
in absolute dollars depreciation expense in north american customer care decreased between periods as a result of adopting eitf no 
the adoption of this pronouncement resulted in the amortization of contract acquisition costs being deducted from revenue they were previously recorded as amortization expense through the first quarter of as well as the result of the impairments recorded during the fourth quarter of  which partially offset an increase from the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in february the decrease in international customer care depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue is the result of higher revenue as well as the impairments recorded during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of in absolute dollars  depreciation expense was comparable between years 
the increase in database marketing and consulting depreciation expense is the result of greater fixed asset balances in as well as the commencement of amortizing certain capitalized software costs during the third quarter of as a result of launching new products 
restructuring charges 
during the year ended december   the north american customer care segment recorded restructuring charges of approximately million related to the closure of its kansas city  kansas facility being used to serve the usps 
these charges consisted primarily of the remaining lease liability along with severance payments 
in addition  the company s north american customer care segment recorded a charge of million for severance and termination benefits for employees at a managed center that was shut down in march the company s north american customer care  international customer care and database marketing and consulting segments also recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  during the year ended december  for other severance and termination benefits related to the termination of  and administrative employees  respectively 
the company reversed approximately million of excess accruals related to restructurings 
the reversal of excess accruals has been offset against the restructuring expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
impairment loss 
during  the north american customer care segment recorded an impairment loss of approximately million to reduce the net book value of the long lived assets of its kansas city  kansas cmc to their estimated fair market value 
see discussion above under critical accounting policies 
during  the international customer care segment recorded an impairment loss of approximately million to reduce the net book value of the long lived assets of our mexico city cmc to their estimated fair market value 
see discussion above under critical accounting policies 
if we do not achieve the results projected in our probability weighted cash flows for certain customer centers  particularly a center in the uk  then we would record an impairment loss in see additional discussion in critical accounting policies 
other income expense 
the increase in other expense between periods was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as well as foreign currency transaction losses partially offset by a decrease in the equity losses from our investment in enhansiv holdings  inc 
ehi during interest expense increased as a result of a higher debt balances in compared to due to borrowings related to the purchase of the corporate headquarters building in february in addition  the interest rates were increased in august as a result of amending our debt agreements due to violations of debt covenants 
the foreign currency transaction losses were incurred primarily on the intercompany receivable payable between the us and canada related to services being provided in canada on behalf of us based clients  and primarily during the first six months of during  we recorded approximately million of foreign currency transaction losses versus the million gain in foreign currency transaction losses and gains are related to intercompany receivable payable balances  and while we hedge the foreign currency risks associated with our labor costs in canada  we do not hedge risks associated with the timing of settling intercompany accounts 
we began settling these accounts more timely in the third quarter of  which mitigated our future exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
see discussion in item a 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased million from to primarily because of the following establishment of valuation allowances of million prior year million  mostly in the us and brazil as previously discussed in critical accounting policies  the write down of certain deferred tax assets of approximately million discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  state income taxes of approximately million to be paid even though the us expects to report a taxable loss  partially offset by increases to certain foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities of million 
if we do not achieve the results in our cash flow analysis used to evaluate the deferred tax assets in mexico  a valuation allowance of up to million may need to be established 
see additional discussion in critical accounting policies 
because we have recorded material deferred tax valuation allowances  until the allowance has been utilized  income tax expense will principally represent current taxes payable and  accordingly  our effective tax rate will be less than the statutory rate 
at this time  we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the range of to 
we are reviewing various tax planning strategies  some of which might result in our receiving tax refunds 
it is premature to know how much  if any  or when the refunds may take place 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment of approximately million related to the goodwill of our latin american reporting unit 
the impairment was due to the economic risk and uncertainty associated with that region  particularly argentina  and the corresponding high discount rate used in the sfas no 
calculation 
versus revenues 
the increase in north american customer care revenue between periods was driven primarily by a new client program offset by the ramp down or no longer having approximately ten multi client center programs  primarily in the communications sector 
the decrease in international customer care revenue between periods is the net result of higher revenue in asia pacific offset by lower revenue in latin america and europe 
the increase in asia pacific is primarily due to growth in existing client programs in australia and new zealand 
the decrease in europe was driven by spain terminating several unprofitable contracts 
latin american revenue decreased primarily as a result of currency devaluation in argentina 
since then  we have converted the majority of the contracts in argentina to the us based contracts priced in us dollars 
database marketing and consulting revenue increased primarily due to an increase in the customer base as well as increased sales to existing customers 
costs of services 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care increased over the prior year 
the costs of services as a percentage of revenue have been adversely impacted by several factors 
the first is the launch of a significant new north american customer care program 
the terms of the contract contemplated work being transitioned from existing high cost locations to lower labor cost markets over time 
accordingly  the hourly rate paid to us by the client declined during the first two years of the contract period eventually leveling off for the remainder of the contract based on a transition plan 
due to higher call volumes than originally anticipated  we did not transition work to lower cost markets as quickly as the original plan contemplated 
we completed the transition plan late in in addition  costs of services as a percentage of revenue was adversely impacted by deterioration of margins at percepta  primarily due to price concessions sought by ford 
ford advised us that such concessions were in line with the price concessions ford received from all of its vendors 
this led to efforts to reduce costs and in percepta returned to profitability 
the increase in costs of services as a percentage of revenue in international customer care between periods occurred in all regions 
the degradation in latin america is primarily due no longer having several profitable programs in mexico 
the degradation in asia pacific is primarily due a price reduction that took effect in and other pricing pressures 
europe costs of services as a percentage of revenue deteriorated between periods primarily as the result of deterioration in spain due to pricing pressures 
in the second quarter of  spain did exit certain unprofitable contracts during the year  and spain s margins did improve subsequent to these actions 
costs of services as a percentage of revenue for database marketing and consulting are comparable 
selling  general and administrative 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in north american customer care is primarily due to the increase in revenue between periods as a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to as a result of cost containment initiatives  the expenses in consulting  travel and entertainment and long distance telephone costs decreased from to in addition  a favorable outcome of collection of an accounts receivable resulted in a reduction of bad debt expense from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for international customer care increased between periods 
in absolute dollars  the decrease between periods was due to decreases in the corporate allocation due to lower corporate consulting and relocation expenses offset by increases in asia pacific and latin america 
the increase in asia pacific was caused partially by changes in exchange rates and headcount additions related to expansion to other countries 
the increase in latin america was primarily as a result of an increase in mexico only partially offset by decreases in argentina and brazil 
the increase in mexico was primarily due to increases in maintenance and employee related costs due to increases in headcount 
the decreases in argentina and brazil were primarily driven by currency devaluation 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in database marketing and consulting is primarily due to the increase in revenue between periods as a significant amount of selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed in nature 
in absolute dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from to because salaries increased to support the business growth as well as higher commissions related to launch of a significant customer in august depreciation and amortization 
in absolute dollars  depreciation expense decreased between periods resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
which resulted in no goodwill amortization during  and the adoption of eitf no 
which resulted in the amortization of contract acquisition costs being deducted from revenue they were previously recorded as amortization expense through the first quarter of 
during and  these two items accounted for million and million  respectively 
the remaining absolute dollar decrease in north america is a result of depreciation expense reductions due to site closures and fully depreciated assets partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
restructuring charges 
during  the north american customer care segment recorded restructuring charges associated with the termination of administrative employees  the closure of a cmc in canada and the impairment of a property lease totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  the company s international customer care segment recorded a loss on the closure of two cmcs in spain of approximately million and restructuring charges associated with the termination of administrative employees of million 
during  we recorded a million loss in our north american customer care segment on the closure of a cmc located in thornton  colorado 
in addition  we implemented certain cost cutting measures 
in connection with these actions  we recorded severance and other termination benefits related to a reduction in force of approximately employees and recognized restructuring charges of million  million and million in north american customer care  international customer care and database marketing and consulting segments  respectively 
impairment loss 
during  we recorded a million impairment loss in the fourth quarter to adjust the fixed asset balances of certain cmcs in the north american customer care and international customer care segments to their fair market values  in accordance with sfas no 
during  we recorded a loss on real estate held for sale of million in north american customer care as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense 
typically  the majority of other income expense is recorded as a corporate expense  which is allocated to the segments 
therefore  the following explanations are for the total of all segments 
included in other expense is approximately million related to purchasing the common stock of ehi from the four remaining outside shareholders along with approximately million of equity losses related to ehi for the period prior to when we began consolidating the results of ehi prior to june 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  ford has the right to earn additional warrants based upon percepta s achievement of certain revenue thresholds 
we recorded other expense of million in related to earning these warrants and then determined in that the warrants had not been earned and recorded other income of million 
included in is a non recurring million loss for the other than temporary decline in value of our equity investment in ehi  as well as million for our share of losses from ehi 
additionally  net interest expense increased approximately million in from this increase is primarily due to our senior notes which were outstanding for the entire year of bearing interest at a higher rate than our existing line of credit agreement  which was the most significant debt balance in income taxes 
taxes increased from primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax asset balances in its international customer care segment during this resulted in recording tax expense despite reporting a book loss 
during  we also recorded tax expense while reporting a book loss due to the non deductibility of equity losses from the investment in ehi for part of the year combined with the relatively small pre tax loss amount 
excluding the increase of valuation allowances in and the non deductible ehi losses in described above  our effective tax rate for was compared with for liquidity and capital resources cash requirements our primary future cash requirements are detailed in the following table of contractual obligations at december   amounts in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years over years total long term debt and senior notes    capital lease obligations  line of credit   grant advances   purchase obligations     operating lease commitments     total      reflected on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
not reflected on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are currently attempting to renegotiate the terms of the grant as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe a portion of this will then become due in more than one year 
long term debt and senior notes relate primarily to our senior notes agreement  which is described in more detail below 
capital lease obligations relate primarily to equipment leases that are generally less than three years in term 
the line of credit relates primarily to the revolver  which is described in more detail below  as well as a line of credit we have in spain 
grant advances are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  and are primarily related to grants from local or state governments as incentive to locate cmcs within their jurisdiction 
purchase obligations are contractual commitments we have to purchase a variety of goods and services 
operating lease commitments relate primarily to facility leases for our cmcs  the lease terms for which generally range from to years 
in the first quarter of  we will be required to repay approximately million of the grant advances and back rent as part of renegotiations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our liquidity requirements include cash related expenses associated with costs of services and selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as interest expense and income tax expense 
in  payroll related expenses  telecommunications costs and facility lease expenses comprised approximately of costs of services and selling  general and administrative expenses combined  with payroll related expenses comprising the largest component of the total approximately 
given the nature of our client agreements  the majority of payroll related expenses are semi variable in nature and fluctuate with increases or decreases in call volumes related to client projects 
as it relates to the individual segment liquidity requirements  historically  the north american customer care and database marketing and consulting segments have generated sufficient cash from operating activities to fund operations 
the european and latin american operations within the international customer care segment have historically required funding from other regions of the company  including north america and asia pacific 
purchase commitments 
effective december   we entered into a forty two month telecommunication services agreement the services agreement with a major telecommunications company the telecomm company with a minimum purchase commitment of million 
the services agreement specifies that  if by january   the telecomm company has not awarded us  full time equivalent seats and a twenty four month commitment  we may terminate the services agreement without liability 
in the event that the services agreement is terminated by us without cause or by the telecomm company for cause  we will be required to pay an amount equal to the difference between the minimum commitment and the actual services purchased during the life of the services agreement 
although no assurances can be given  we believe that our telecommunication service requirements will be sufficient to meet the minimum commitment amount 
effective december  we entered into a thirty month initial period contract with another telecommunications company with a minimum purchase commitment of million 
if we terminate the contract during the initial period  a penalty of up to of the minimum purchase commitment will be assessed 
if  during the initial period  the telecommunications company terminates or significantly reduces volumes under a master service agreement signed with us on june   a penalty of of the remaining minimum purchase commitment can be assessed 
capital expenditure commitments and other cash requirements 
our cash requirements also include capital expenditures primarily related to ongoing maintenance  upgrades or replacement of existing assets  and the development and retrofit of new cmcs 
we used million in investing activities in  primarily related to the million acquisition of our corporate headquarters  the development of new cmcs and  to a lesser extent  capitalized software costs related to our database marketing and consulting segment 
in  we used million in investing activities  primarily related to the development of new cmcs and capitalized software activities incurred in the database marketing and consulting segment 
in addition  in we received proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and the liquidation of short term investments 
we used million in investing activities during  primarily for capital expenditures related to the development of new cmcs  including expenditures related to our planned headquarters building  as well as funding for enhansiv 
we currently expect total capital expenditures in to range between million and million  the majority of which is attributable to maintenance capital for existing cmcs  the opening or expansion of cmcs and internal technology projects 
such expenditures are financed with internally generated cash flows  existing cash balances and  to the extent necessary  cash flows from financing activities 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirement for additional cmc capacity and technological infrastructure 
furthermore  if growth is generated through facilities management contracts  where we provide customer management services from a client owned facility  the anticipated level of capital expenditures may decline 
in april  we announced a joint venture agreement with bharti enterprises limited bharti to provide in country and offshore customer management solutions in india 
under terms of the agreement  we will participate with bharti in a joint venture known as teletech services india private limited teletech india 
each party initially had a ownership interest in teletech india with teletech having the ability to acquire up to of the venture 
in february  we acquired an additional interest in teletech india  bringing our total ownership interest in teletech india to 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of  we formed percepta with ford motor company ford 
percepta was formed to provide global customer management solutions to ford and other automotive companies 
under the joint venture operating agreement  we have the right to require ford to purchase our interest in percepta at fair market value at any time after december  ford also has the right to require us to sell our interest in percepta at fair market value at any time after december  the net book value of percepta as of december  is approximately million 
for the year ended december   percepta reported revenue and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
known trends and uncertainties 
from time to time we launch large client contracts that may result in significant negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program  and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
from time to time  we engage in discussions regarding restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
any such transaction could include  among other things  the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures  or the incurrence  assumption or refinancing of indebtedness  and could be material to the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
there is no assurance that any such discussions will result in the consummation of any such transaction 
as discussed above  during the first quarter we used proceeds from our revolving credit agreement to acquire our corporate headquarters building  previously financed under a synthetic lease agreement 
the sale or refinancing of the corporate headquarters building may result in the company recognizing a loss on the sale of the property  as we believe the current fair market value may be less than the book value 
furthermore  the sale would result in the settlement of the related interest rate swap agreement  which would require an estimated current cash payment of approximately million as of december  balance sheet  income or cash flow items to be considered in assessing liquidity 
in assessing liquidity  the primary balance sheet  income or cash flow items to consider include negative changes in working capital related to significant increases in days sales outstanding and or decreases in days payable 
other items to consider when assessing liquidity include net operating losses and large increases in capital expenditures  as each of the above items may result in an increase in cash requirements 
sources of cash operations 
our primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in cash provided by operating activities in consists of a net loss of million before adjustments for depreciation and amortization  deferred taxes on income  changes in working capital and the impairment of certain fixed assets 
the effect of the change in working capital accounts and other assets and liabilities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows between years of approximately million is primarily the result of an increase in days sales outstanding from days as of december  to days as of december  offset by the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is directly caused by the decrease in income from operations 
cash provided by operating activities in was  consisting of a net loss of million before adjustments for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  impairment loss  depreciation and amortization  bad debt  working capital  and other charges primarily related to restructurings 
the effect of the change in working capital accounts on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows between and of approximately million is primarily the result of improved accounts receivable collections 
at december   accounts receivable decreased as a result of more aggressive collection procedures  with days sales outstanding decreasing from days at december  to days at year end cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in  and consists of a net loss of million before adjustments for depreciation and amortization  bad debt  working capital  and other charges primarily related to restructurings and its equity investment in ehi 
the change in cash flows from working capital between years of approximately million is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable decreased as a result of more aggressive collection procedures  with our days sales outstanding decreasing from days at december  to days as december  the amount and certainty of future cash flows depends primarily on our ability to operate profitably 
as explained in detail under client concentrations  income from operations is expected to decline in related to a decrease in revenue from a major north american customer care client 
this will negatively impact our cash from operations by an estimated million 
financing 
we currently have two existing debt instruments that provide  or have provided  cash from financing activities 
these instruments include the revolver and senior notes 
cash provided by financing activities in was million and primarily related to drawing million on the revolver in the first quarter of to acquire of our corporate headquarters building as discussed above 
cash used in financing activities in was million  and primarily resulted from the stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors for the purchase of up to million of our common stock  which we completed during cash provided by financing activities in was million  resulting primarily from in proceeds received from the senior notes and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases  offset by repaying the revolving line of credit then in place in the amount of million and payments on long term notes and capital lease obligations 
our revolver is with a syndicate of five banks 
under the terms of the revolver  we may borrow up to million with the ability to increase the borrowing limit by an additional million  subject to lender approval  within three years from the october closing date of the revolver 
the revolver matures on december   at which time a balloon payment for the principal amount is due  however  there is no penalty for early prepayment 
the revolver bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
the interest rate will also vary based on our leverage ratios as defined in the agreement 
at december   the interest rate was per annum with million drawn under the revolver 
the revolver is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and is secured by a majority of our domestic assets 
a significant restrictive covenant under the revolver requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
the revolver also limits the amount of share repurchases and prohibits payment of cash dividends 
we also have million of senior notes  of which million have an interest rate of per annum and million have an interest rate of per annum 
interest on the senior notes is payable semi annually and million of principal payments commence in october with final maturity in october a significant restrictive covenant under the senior notes requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
additionally  in the event the senior notes were to be repaid in full prior to maturity  we would have to remit a make whole payment as defined in the agreement to the holders of the senior notes 
as of december   the make whole payment is approximately million 
the revolver and the senior notes are both securitized with a majority of our domestic assets 
in addition  the revolver and senior notes each contain provisions whereby a default under either agreement results in a cross default in the other agreement 
further  the revolver and senior notes are subject to an inter creditor agreement  which includes the allocation methodology by which the proceeds would be distributed to the revolver lenders and senior notes lenders in the event of default  and subsequent liquidation 
at december   outstanding letters of credit totaled approximately million  which primarily guarantees workers compensation and other insurance related obligations  and facility leases 
during  percepta paid million in dividends to the minority interest partner in percepta and million to us 
assuming percepta continues to operate profitably  we believe percepta will continue to pay dividends in at approximately the same level as in as a result  the joint venture expects to pay up to million to the minority interest partner during and million to us 
debt instruments and related covenants as a result of lower than anticipated financial performance in the first quarter  we are currently forecasting we will be in violation of certain financial covenants in the revolver and senior note agreements as of march  we are pursuing several alternatives to address the potential violation should we indeed not operate within the covenants  including obtaining waivers or amendments to the debt agreements  paying off all or a portion of the outstanding debt agreements and obtaining new financing 
obtaining waivers or amendments to the existing debt agreements may result in amendment fees and higher annual interest expense  as well as additional or stricter financial covenants 
there is no assurance we will successfully obtain waivers or amendments  or maintain compliance with financial covenants in the future 
in addition  paying off all or a portion of the outstanding debt may have a negative impact to current and future earnings resulting from owing a make whole provision associated with the company s senior notes agreement  costs related to terminating the interest rate swap associated with the revolver  both of which are described in more detail herein  and the write off of million of capitalized fees 
as of december   we have a derivative liability associated with this interest rate swap agreement of approximately million  which is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in the event we wanted to terminate the swap  the above mentioned liability would have to be settled with cash and a charge to operations recorded 
likewise  if we repay the associated revolver balance or obtain new financing  the hedge may no longer be effective and a corresponding charge to operations would be recorded either immediately or over the remaining life of the revolver 
in pursuing new debt alternatives  we may utilize various financing sources including fixed and floating rate debt  convertible debt  and or an asset backed loan 
the amount financed will vary  based on whether we decide to pay a portion of the outstanding debt with existing cash 
the specific terms of the new financing  including the applicable interest rate  length of agreement and other financing features  will be dependent upon the total amount financed and the creditors assessment of our ability to repay 
there is no assurance that we can obtain new financing  or that new financing would not result in higher annual interest expense 
client concentrations our five largest clients accounted for  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client  and the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
the contracts with these clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
although we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest customers  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed  or if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
under the terms of the original contract with verizon communications verizon relating to its competitive local exchange carrier clec business  there were certain minimum monthly volume commitments at pre determined hourly billing rates minimum commitments 
as previously reported  when the clec work was redirected to other verizon business units during  verizon continued to honor the contractual terms of its minimum commitments 
while the terms negotiated by these business units were generally at lower hourly billing rates base rates than the minimum commitments  verizon has continued to meet its financial obligations associated with the minimum commitments 
in certain instances  the base rates exceed current market rates for similar services and upon contract expiration  if the contracts are renewed  we expect the rates we receive for our services in the future to be less than the base rates 
in some instances  volume associated with new work is also offset against the minimum commitments 
in addition  certain minimum commitments were bought out with cash and these settlement payments are being amortized over the life of such minimum commitments 
the majority of the minimum commitments had been satisfied by december  with the remainder expected to expire in the first quarter of the amount of minimum commitments satisfied by verizon in excess of the base rates  together with amortized settlement payments  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
it is expected that this amount will decline to approximately million in and thereafter 
these amounts will impact pre tax earnings by a like amount 
the anticipated decline will have an adverse affect on our operating results in unless we are successful in reducing costs and or increasing revenue 
a large client in spain informed the company of its intention to issue a request for proposals upon contract expiration in the fourth quarter of this client accounts for of spain s revenue 
we expect to retain the majority of the revenue from this client 
the loss of a portion of this contract is expected to improve the company s consolidated operations  financial position or cash flows due to improved operating margins 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
certain elements  which would impact the company  did not have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  libor and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we had entered into forward financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rates with several financial institutions to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency risk 
we have also entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our cash flow risk on the portion of the revolver used to purchase the corporate headquarters building as interest is variable based upon libor 
interest rate risk the interest on the revolver is variable based upon libor and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   there was million outstanding on the revolver 
if libor increased  there would be no impact to the company due to the related interest rate swap as previously discussed 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  india  korea  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  northern ireland  the philippines  scotland  singapore  and spain 
revenue and expenses from these operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
the changes in the exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our revenue and net income attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenue from non us countries represented  and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
we have contracted with several commercial banks at no material cost  to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through october at a fixed price in us dollars of million 
we have derivative assets of million associated with foreign exchange contracts 
if the us canadian dollar exchange rate were to increase from period end levels  we would not incur a material loss on the contracts 
a significant business strategy for our north american customer care segment is to provide service to us based customers from canadian cmcs in order to leverage the us canadian dollar exchange rates 
during the year ended december   the canadian dollar strengthened against the us dollar by 
as a result  our revenue remains constant in us dollars  whereas our costs which are denominated in canadian dollars are increasing 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from changes in the us canadian dollar exchange rates in the short term for the majority of our risk  an overall strengthening of the canadian dollar may adversely impact margins in the north american customer care segment over the long term 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
for example  the intercompany transactions that we expect to be settled are denominated in the local currency of the billing company 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe this to be insignificant 
when the deterioration of the us dollar resulted in losses in the second quarter of  we implemented procedures to shorten the time it takes to settle these transactions  therefore effectively minimizing the foreign currency losses 
if realized losses on foreign transactions were to become significant  we would evaluate appropriate strategies  including the possible use of foreign exchange contracts  to reduce such losses 
fair value of debt and equity securities the company did not have any material investments in debt or equity securities at december
