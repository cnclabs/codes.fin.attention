item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is management s analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the corporation 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
during  the corporation merged associated card services bank  national association  and associated bank illinois  national association  into associated bank  national association  to create a single national banking charter headquartered in green bay  wisconsin 
also during  the corporation merged wisconsin finance corporation  citizens financial services  inc  and signal finance company into a single finance company under the name riverside finance  inc during the second quarter of  the corporation merged the minnesota bank subsidiaries associated bank minnesota  signal bank national association  and signal bank south national association into a single national banking charter under the name associated bank minnesota  national association 
the financial discussion that follows may refer to the effect of the corporation s business combination activity  detailed under section  business combinations  and note  business combinations  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the detailed financial discussion focuses on results compared to discussion of results compared to is predominantly in section compared to critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights valuation  derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and income taxes 
the consolidated financial statements of the corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
this preparation requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions  and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management believes the following policies are both important to the portrayal of the corporation s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments and  therefore  management considers the following to be critical accounting policies 
the critical accounting policies are discussed directly with the audit committee of the corporation 
allowance for loan losses management s evaluation process used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the evaluation process combines several factors management s ongoing review and grading of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  trends in past due and nonperforming loans  risk characteristics of the various classifications of loans  existing economic conditions  the fair value of underlying collateral  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
because current economic conditions can change and future events are inherently difficult to predict  the anticipated amount of estimated loan losses  and therefore the adequacy of the allowance  could change significantly 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the corporation believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section allowance for loan losses 
mortgage servicing rights valuation the fair value of the corporation s mortgage servicing rights asset is important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements since the mortgage servicing rights are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation relies on an internal discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights and consults periodically with third parties as to the assumptions used and that the resultant valuation is within the context of the market 
while the corporation believes that the values produced by its internal model are indicative of the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights portfolio  these values can change significantly depending upon the then current interest rate environment  estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced  and other economic conditions 
the proceeds that might be received should the corporation actually consider a sale of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio could differ from the amounts reported at any point in time 
the corporation believes the mortgage servicing rights asset is properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section noninterest expense 
derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
substantially all of these derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
however  if in the future the derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting treatment and  consequently  the change in the fair value of hedged items could be recognized in earnings  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
the corporation believes hedge effectiveness is evaluated properly in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting the assessment of tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities  will not differ from management s current assessment  the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings 
the corporation believes the tax assets and liabilities are adequate and properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and section income taxes 
segment review as described in note  segment reporting  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation s primary reportable segment is banking  conducted through its bank and lending subsidiaries 
banking includes a community banking lending and deposit gathering to businesses including business related services such as cash management and international banking services and to consumers including mortgages and credit cards  b corporate banking specialized lending such as commercial real estate  lease financing  and banking to larger businesses and metro or niche markets  and c the support to deliver banking services 
the corporation s profitability is primarily dependent on net interest income  noninterest income  the level of the provision for loan losses  noninterest expense  and taxes of its banking segment 
the consolidated discussion is therefore predominantly describing the banking segment results 
the critical accounting policies primarily affect the banking segment  with the exception of income tax accounting  which affects both the banking and other segments see section critical accounting policies 
overview the corporation is a multi bank holding company headquartered in wisconsin  providing a diversified range of banking and nonbanking services to individuals and businesses primarily in its three state footprint wisconsin  illinois and minnesota 
the corporation s primary sources of revenue are net interest income predominantly from loans and deposits  though also from investments and other funding sources  and noninterest income  particularly fees and other revenue from financial services provided to customers 
business volumes and pricing drive revenue potential  and tend to be influenced by overall economic factors  including market interest rates  business spending  consumer confidence  economic growth  and competitive conditions within the marketplace as well 
noninterest income growth in was led by mortgage banking income 
during  interest rates reached record lows  resulting in an unprecedented volume of mortgage loan originations and refinances 
as a result  mortgage banking income was up over a rapid rise in mortgage interest rates  particularly during late third quarter  slowed mortgage loan volume 
industry expectations are for mortgage originations to fall dramatically in  and as such the corporation expects lower mortgage banking income for noninterest income sources continue to be diversified  including the corporation s acquisition of an insurance agency in the corporation s loan mix changed during  though total loans were billion at year end  unchanged from year end competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans in the low rate environment put downward pressure on loan yields and the net interest margin in residential mortgage loans decreased  strongly influenced by high refinance activity 
home equity an area of emphasis for and an attractive product to consumers given the low rate environment and other consumer loans combined grew  and commercial loans grew 
increases in business spending and consumer confidence in  along with an increase in interest rates  could create an environment for increased earnings from loans for growth in deposits continued to be strong throughout this growth reflects a number of strategic initiatives to grow the deposit base  as well as customer preference to keep funds more liquid in this prolonged low interest rate environment 
deposit growth initiatives will continue in asset quality administration was active during with early identification of potential problems and progress on several larger problem credits 
at year end nonperforming loans were higher than historic levels  but a allowance for loan losses to loans ratio was deemed adequate by management 
certain economic indicators suggest that business spending has begun to increase and that business and consumer financial positions are improving in line with recent economic improvements 
while uncertainty exists as to how robust or sustainable this trend may be  the impact of such improvements would likely be positive to the corporation s credit quality indicators and could lead to a lower provision for loan losses in than in the efficiency ratio defined as noninterest expense divided by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income  excluding net asset and securities gains was for and for the corporation has and will continue to monitor costs

business combinations in there was one completed business combination 
on april   the corporation consummated its cash acquisition of of the outstanding shares of cfg  a closely held insurance agency headquartered in minnetonka  minnesota 
effective june  cfg operated as associated financial group  llc

income statement analysis net interest income net interest income in the consolidated statements of income which excludes the taxable equivalent adjustment was million  compared to million in the taxable equivalent adjustments the adjustments to bring tax exempt interest to a level that would yield the same after tax income had that income been subject to taxation using a tax rate of million for and million for resulted in fully taxable equivalent net interest income of million and million  respectively 
net interest income is the primary source of the corporation s revenue 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense on interest bearing deposits and other borrowings used to fund interest earning and other assets or activities 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and by the amount and composition of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  net interest income is impacted by the sensitivity of the balance sheet to changes in interest rates  which factors in characteristics such as the fixed or variable nature of the financial instruments  contractual maturities  repricing frequencies  and the use of interest rate swaps and caps 
interest rate spread and net interest margin are utilized to measure and explain changes in net interest income 
interest rate spread is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities that fund those assets 
the net interest margin is expressed as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread because noninterest bearing sources of funds net free funds  principally demand deposits and stockholders equity  also support earning assets 
to compare tax exempt asset yields to taxable yields  the yield on tax exempt loans and securities is computed on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin are discussed on a taxable equivalent basis 
table provides average balances of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the associated interest income and expense  and the corresponding interest rates earned and paid  as well as net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis for the three years ended december  tables through present additional information to facilitate the review and discussion of taxable equivalent net interest income  interest rate spread  and net interest margin 
taxable equivalent net interest income was million for  an increase of million or from the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was a function of a higher level of earning assets  offset by unfavorable interest rate changes 
the net interest margin for was  compared to in the bp compression in net interest margin is attributable to a bp decrease in interest rate spread with a bp decrease in the yield on earning assets  substantially offset by a bp lower cost of interest bearing liabilities  and an bp lower contribution from net free funds impacted by the lower rate environment  despite a million increase in average net free funds 
interest rates were generally stable and historically low during both and comparatively  the federal funds rate at december   was at a year low of  bp lower than at december   while the average federal funds rate for was bp lower than for as shown in the rate volume analysis in table  volume changes added million to taxable equivalent net interest income  while rate changes resulted in an million decrease  for a net increase of million 
from a volume perspective  the growth and composition change of earning assets added million to taxable equivalent net interest income in  while the growth and composition of interest bearing liabilities cost an additional million  netting a million increase to taxable equivalent net interest income 
rate changes on earning assets reduced interest income by million  while the changes in rates on interest bearing liabilities lowered interest expense by million  for a net unfavorable impact of million 
for  the yield on earning assets fell bp to  driven primarily by an bp decline in the loan yield 
the average loan yield was 
competitive pricing on new and refinanced loans and the repricing of variable rate loans in the lower interest rate environment put downward pressure on loan yields in the yield on securities and short term investments combined was down bp to 
the earning asset rate changes reduced interest income by million  a combination of million lower interest on loans and million lower interest on securities and short term investments combined 
for  the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased bp to  aided by the lower rate environment 
the combined average cost of interest bearing deposits was  down bp from  benefiting from a larger mix of lower costing transaction accounts  as well as from lower rates on interest bearing deposit products in general 
the cost of wholesale funds comprised of all short term borrowings and long term funding decreased bp to for  favorably impacted by lower rates year over year and the maturity of higher rate wholesale funds during the year 
the interest bearing liability rate changes resulted in million lower interest expense  with million attributable to interest bearing deposits and million due to wholesale funding 
average earning assets were billion in  an increase of million  or  from loans accounted for the majority of the growth in earning assets  increasing by million  or  to billion on average in and representing of average earning assets compared to for for  taxable equivalent interest income on loans increased million from growth  but decreased million from the impact of the low rate environment as noted above  for a net decrease of million versus last year see table 
balances of securities and short term investments combined increased million on average 
taxable equivalent interest income on securities and short term investments for increased million from volume changes  but decreased million from the impact of the rate environment  for a net million decrease to taxable equivalent interest income 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  from  while net free funds increased million  both supporting the growth in earning assets 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits a component of net free funds increased by million  or 
interest bearing deposits grew  on average  million  or  to billion  the net result of increases in interest bearing demand and savings deposits and declines in money market accounts and time deposits 
interest expense on interest bearing deposits for decreased million from the impact of the rate environment and decreased million from volume and mix changes  for a net million decrease to interest expense 
average wholesale funding sources increased by million 
the corporation continued its shift of funding given the continued low rate environment from short term borrowing sources to long term funding  increasing its average long term funding by million to of average interest bearing liabilities compared to for

mortgage banking income consists of servicing fees  the gain or loss on sales of mortgage loans to the secondary market  and other related fees

credit card and other nondeposit fees were million for  a decrease of million or from  primarily attributable to lower merchant fees  given the merchant processing sale and services agreement consummated in march in february  the corporation entered into a year agreement with an outside vendor to provide merchant processing services for the corporation s merchant customers 
the agreement resulted in a gain of million recorded in other noninterest income and replaces gross merchant discount fees with revenue sharing on new and existing merchant business over the life of the agreement 
thus  credit card fees were down million versus ie reduced merchant discount fees  offset partly by increased inclearing fees  while other nondeposit fees were up million primarily cfg related advisory fees 
retail commission income which includes commissions from insurance and brokerage product sales was million  up million or compared to other insurance revenues were up million  while fixed annuities commissions decreased million 
other insurance revenue was favorably impacted by the cfg acquisition but offset partly by lower loan insurance commissions  which were affected by legislation in late requiring single premium credit insurance premiums on loans with real estate to be collected based on monthly outstanding balances 
fixed annuities commissions declined during  in part due to the prolonged low rate environment  customer preference for more attractive rate driven products  and the recent recovery in the equity markets

while the strong mortgage refinance activity benefited mortgage banking income  it increased the prepayment speeds of the corporation s mortgage portfolio serviced for others  a key factor behind the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
however  during the second half of and particularly fourth quarter  mortgage interest rates began to rise  slowing both prepayment speeds and mortgage refinance activity 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s accounting policy for mortgage servicing rights and section critical accounting policies 
mortgage servicing rights are considered a critical accounting policy given that estimating the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights involves judgment  particularly of estimated prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages serviced and the overall level of interest rates 
loan type and note rate are the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans used to stratify capitalized mortgage servicing rights for purposes of measuring impairment 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights exceeds the estimated fair value by stratification 
net income could be affected if management s estimates of the prepayment speeds or other factors differ materially from actual prepayments 
an other than temporary impairment is recognized as a write down of the mortgage servicing rights asset and the related valuation allowance to the extent valuation reserve is available and then against earnings 
a direct write down permanently reduces the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights asset and valuation allowance  precluding subsequent recoveries 
mortgage servicing rights  included in other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet  were million  net of a million valuation allowance at december   and represented bp of the billion portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for others 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 
intangible amortization expense increased to million  primarily due to additional core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the signal and cfg acquisitions 
loan expense was million  down million from  predominantly due to lower merchant processing costs  given the sale of the merchant processing during the first quarter of as noted in section noninterest income 
other expense was up million over  attributable primarily to a million charge on commercial letters of credit given the deterioration of the financial condition of a borrower  and million higher foreclosure costs including a million write down on one commercial other real estate owned property 
income taxes income tax expense for was million  up million from income tax expense of million 
the corporation s effective tax rate income tax expense divided by income before taxes was in both and see note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the corporation s income tax accounting policy and section critical accounting policies 
income tax expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income involves interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes  and is  therefore  considered a critical accounting policy 
the corporation undergoes examination by various taxing authorities 
such taxing authorities may require that changes in the amount of tax expense or valuation allowance be recognized when their interpretations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

projects undertaken by these developers are carefully reviewed by the corporation to ensure that they are economically viable 
loans of this type are primarily made to customers based in the corporation s tri state market in which the corporation has a thorough knowledge of the local market economy 
the credit risk associated with real estate construction loans is generally confined to specific geographic areas  but is also influenced by general economic conditions 
the corporation controls the credit risk on these types of loans by making loans in familiar markets to developers  underwriting the loans to meet the requirements of institutional investors in the secondary market  reviewing the merits of individual projects  controlling loan structure  and monitoring project progress and construction advances 
commercial real estate includes loans secured by farmland  multifamily properties  and nonfarm nonresidential real estate properties 
commercial real estate totaled billion at december   up million or over december   and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end commercial real estate loans involve borrower characteristics similar to those discussed above for commercial loans and real estate construction projects 
loans of this type are mainly for business and industrial properties  multifamily properties  and community purpose properties 
loans are primarily made to customers based in wisconsin  illinois  and minnesota 
credit risk is managed in a similar manner to commercial loans and real estate construction by employing sound underwriting guidelines  lending to borrowers in local markets and businesses  and formally reviewing the borrower s financial soundness and relationship on an ongoing basis 
in many cases the corporation will take additional real estate collateral to further secure the overall lending relationship 
residential real estate loans totaled billion at the end of  down million or from the prior year and comprised of total loans outstanding versus at year end loans in this classification include residential mortgage which consists of conventional home mortgages and second mortgages and home equity lines 
residential mortgage loans generally limit the maximum loan to of collateral value 
residential mortgage loans were billion at december   down million or compared to the prior year  principally due to high refinance activity prompted by lower interest rates and the subsequent sale of newer  fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
home equity lines grew by million  or  to million in  an attractive product to consumers given the lower rate environment and an area of emphasis in consumer loans to individuals totaled million at december   down million or compared to  representing of the year end loan portfolio 
consumer loans include short term installment loans  direct and indirect automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  credit card loans which are primarily business oriented  student loans  and other personal loans 
individual borrowers may be required to provide related collateral or a satisfactory endorsement or guaranty from another person  depending on the specific type of loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
credit risk for these types of loans is generally greatly influenced by general economic conditions  the characteristics of individual borrowers  and the nature of the loan collateral 
credit risk is primarily controlled by reviewing the creditworthiness of the borrowers as well as taking appropriate collateral and guaranty positions 
factors that are important to managing overall credit quality are sound loan underwriting and administration  systematic monitoring of existing loans and commitments  effective loan review on an ongoing basis  early identification of potential problems  an adequate allowance for loan losses  and sound nonaccrual and charge off policies 
an active credit risk management process is used for commercial loans to further ensure that sound and consistent credit decisions are made 
credit risk is controlled by detailed underwriting procedures  comprehensive loan administration  and periodic review of borrowers outstanding loans and commitments 
borrower relationships are formally reviewed on an ongoing basis for early identification of potential problems 
further analyses by customer  industry  and geographic location are performed to monitor trends  financial performance  and concentrations 
the loan portfolio is widely diversified by types of borrowers  industry groups  and market areas within our primary three state area 
significant loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are amounts loaned to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

allowance for loan losses the loan portfolio is the primary asset subject to credit risk 
credit risks are inherently different for each loan type 
credit risk is controlled and monitored through the use of lending standards  a thorough review of potential borrowers  and on going review of loan payment performance 
active asset quality administration  including early problem loan identification and timely resolution of problems  aids in the management of credit risk and minimization of loan losses 
credit risk management for each loan type is discussed briefly in the section entitled loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  an allocation methodology is applied by the corporation which focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired or other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  underlying collateral  historical losses on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect probable credit losses 
assessing these factors involves significant judgment 
management considers the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy see section critical accounting policies 
see management s allowance for loan losses accounting policy in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  loans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional allowance for loan losses disclosures

the change in the allowance for loan losses is a function of a number of factors  including but not limited to changes in the loan portfolio see table  net charge offs see table  and nonperforming loans see table 
as previously discussed  total loans from year end to were relatively flat down million or  however  the loan mix shifted 
during the commercial loan portfolio grew to represent of total loans at year end compared to last year end 
this segment of the loan portfolio carries greater inherent credit risk described under section loans 
with growth particularly in commercial loans and impacts of the sluggish economy on various borrowers  nonperforming loans to total loans grew to for compared to for net charge offs for increased to million  with the majority of the increase attributable to charge offs in the commercial loan portfolio 
the allocation of the corporation s allowance for loan losses for the last five years is shown in table the allocation methodology applied by the corporation  designed to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  focuses on changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio  changes in levels of impaired and other nonperforming loans  the risk inherent in specific loans  concentrations of loans to specific borrowers or industries  existing economic conditions  underlying collateral  historical losses on each portfolio category  and other qualitative and quantitative factors 
because each of the criteria used is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
management continues to target and maintain the allowance for loan losses equal to the allocation methodology plus an unallocated portion  as determined by economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors affecting the corporation s borrowers 
management allocates the allowance for loan losses for credit losses by pools of risk 
the commercial loan allocations are based on a quarterly review of individual loans  loan types  and industries 
the retail loan residential mortgage  home equity  and consumer allocation is based primarily on analysis of historical delinquency and charge off statistics and trends 
minimum loss factors used by the corporation for criticized loan categories are consistent with regulatory agency factors 
loss factors for non criticized loan categories are based primarily on loan type  historical loan loss experience  and industry statistics 
the mechanism used to address differences between estimated and actual loan loss experience includes review of recent nonperforming loan trends  underwriting trends  external factors  and management s judgment relating to current assumptions 
the allocation methods used for december  and were comparable 
factors used for criticized loans defined as specific loans warranting either specific allocation or a criticized status of watch  special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss  as well as for non criticized loan categories  were unchanged between the years 
at both december  and  current economic conditions carried various uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the impact on the business results of numerous individual borrowers and certain industries 
additionally  the pace at which the financial results of a borrower s company can take a downturn from challenging and varied economic conditions continued to be a factor for both years 
at year end  of the allowance compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing credit million outstanding at december  for which management had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan 
the primary shift in the allowance allocation was the amount allocated to commercial real estate loans at year end  which was million  representing compared to at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
a greater amount of these loans were in criticized categories versus at year end  charge offs of this loan type increased to million for  more than double between the years  these loans represented of nonperforming loans compared to at year end  and commercial real estate loans grew to represent of total loans at december  compared to at year end 
as noted under the section loans  the credit risk of this loan category is largely influenced by the impact on borrowers of general economic conditions  which have been noted to be challenging and uncertain 
the allowance allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans was million at year end  representing versus at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans declined since year end  to represent of total loans at december  compared to at december   net charge offs were million down million  and as a percent of nonperforming loans  these loans represented versus at year end 
the allocation methods used for december  and were comparable 
factors used for criticized loans  as well as for non criticized loan categories  were unchanged between the years 
at both december  and  current economic conditions carried various uncertainties requiring management s judgment as to the possible impact to individual borrowers 
thus  at year end  of the allowance compared to at year end was allocated to criticized loans  including million of allowance identified for a million commercial manufacturing credit for which management had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan given current economic conditions 
while the payments for this credit were current during  the credit was added to nonaccrual loans during second quarter the primary shift in the allowance allocation was the amount allocated to commercial  financial  and agricultural loans at year end which was million  representing compared to at year end of the allowance for loan losses 
a greater amount of these loans were in criticized categories versus at year end  charge offs of this loan type have increased to million for  up between the years  these loans represented of nonperforming loans compared to last year end  and commercial  financial  and agricultural loans grew to represent of total loans at december  compared to at year end 
the allowance allocated to commercial real estate was at year end  down from at year end in for this category  a greater amount of these loans were in criticized loan categories  which materialized into greater charge offs during see table 
while commercial real estate loans grew since year end  they represented of total loans at december   relatively unchanged from last year 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate at december  consolidated net income could be affected if management s estimate of the allowance for loan losses is subsequently materially different  requiring additional or less provision for loan losses to be recorded 
management carefully considers numerous detailed and general factors  its assumptions  and the likelihood of materially different conditions that could alter its assumptions 
while management uses currently available information to recognize losses on loans  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and the impact of such change on the corporation s borrowers 
as an integral part of their examination process  various regulatory agencies also review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require that certain loan balances be charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate owned management is committed to an aggressive nonaccrual and problem loan identification philosophy 
this philosophy is implemented through the ongoing monitoring and review of all pools of risk in the loan portfolio to ensure that problem loans are identified quickly and the risk of loss is minimized 
nonperforming loans are considered one indicator of potential future loan losses 
nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans days or more past due but still accruing  and restructured loans 
the corporation specifically excludes from its definition of nonperforming loans student loan balances that are days or more past due and still accruing and that have contractual government guarantees as to collection of principal and interest 
the corporation had approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  of nonperforming student loans 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
additionally  whenever management becomes aware of facts or circumstances that may adversely impact the collectibility of principal or interest on loans  it is management s practice to place such loans on nonaccrual status immediately  rather than delaying such action until the loans become days past due 
previously accrued and uncollected interest on such loans is reversed  amortization of related loan fees is suspended  and income is recorded only to the extent that interest payments are subsequently received in cash and a determination has been made that the principal balance of the loan is collectible 
if collectibility of the principal is in doubt  payments received are applied to loan principal 
loans past due days or more but still accruing interest are also included in nonperforming loans 
loans past due days or more but still accruing are classified as such where the underlying loans are both well secured the collateral value is sufficient to cover principal and accrued interest and are in the process of collection 
also included in nonperforming loans are restructured loans 
restructured loans involve the granting of some concession to the borrower involving the modification of terms of the loan  such as changes in payment schedule or interest rate

of the million increase in nonperforming loans between year end and  nonaccrual loans increased million  restructured loans increased million  and accruing loans past due days or more increased million 
the corporation s allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was at year end  down from at year end and at year end the upward trend in nonperforming loans was primarily due to increases in commercial nonperforming loans  and mostly due to specific larger commercial credits 
commercial nonaccrual loans were million at december  up million from year end  and represented   and of total nonaccrual loans at year end   and  respectively 
additionally  accruing commercial loans past due days or more were million at december   and represented   and of total accruing loans past due days or more at year end  and  respectively 
for year end versus  the million increase in commercial nonaccrual loans was predominantly attributable to the addition  during the second quarter of  of two large commercial credits totaling approximately million at december   one in the construction industry and one in the hospitality industry 
the million increase from year end to year end in accruing loans past due days or more was primarily attributable to one large commercial credit million at december   while the decrease in restructured loans was due to one large commercial credit that was transferred to nonaccrual status and subsequently charged off 
for year end versus  the increase in commercial nonaccrual loans was predominantly attributable to the addition of a previously disclosed commercial manufacturing relationship totaling million at year end for which payments were current  however  the corporation had doubts concerning the future collectibility of the loan and set aside million of the allowance for loan losses for this credit 
this credit remains in the commercial portfolio at december  million outstanding with continued concerns of collectibility and million of the allowance for loan losses set aside 
the remaining rise in nonaccrual loans for was primarily attributable to the commercial loan portfolio  but not concentrated within any industry 
other real estate owned decreased to million at december   compared to million and million at year end and  respectively 
the change in other real estate owned was predominantly due to the addition and subsequent sale of commercial real estate properties 
an million property was added during  while three other commercial properties at million  million  and million were added during the million property was sold during the second quarter of at a net loss of million  the million property was sold during the third quarter of at a net gain of million  and the million property was sold during the fourth quarter of at a small gain 
also during fourth quarter  a million write down was recorded in other noninterest expense on another commercial property in other real estate owned 
net gains on sales of other real estate owned were   and  for   and  respectively 
management actively seeks to ensure properties held are monitored to minimize the corporation s risk of loss 
the following table shows  for those loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis and restructured loans for the years ended as indicated  the gross interest that would have been recorded if the loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and the amount of interest income that was included in interest income for the period

the decision of management to include performing loans in potential problem loans does not necessarily mean that the corporation expects losses to occur but that management recognizes a higher degree of risk associated with these loans 
the level of potential problem loans is another predominant factor in determining the relative level of risk in the loan portfolio and in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
the loans that have been reported as potential problem loans are not concentrated in a particular industry but rather cover a diverse range of businesses 
at december   potential problem loans totaled million  compared to million at december  the million increase from december  to december   is primarily attributable to deterioration in certain loans in the commercial manufacturing sector accountable for approximately million of the increase

funds are available from a number of sources  primarily from the core deposit base and from loans and securities repayments and maturities 
additionally  liquidity is provided from sales of the securities portfolio  lines of credit with major banks  the ability to acquire large and brokered deposits  and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale 
the corporation s liquidity management framework includes measurement of several key elements  such as wholesale funding as a percent of total assets and liquid assets to short term wholesale funding 
the corporation s liquidity framework also incorporates contingency planning to assess the nature and volatility of funding sources and to determine alternatives to these sources 
the contingency plan would be activated to ensure the corporation s funding commitments could be met in the event of general market disruption or adverse economic conditions 
strong capital ratios  credit quality  and core earnings are essential to retaining high credit ratings and  consequently  cost effective access to the wholesale funding markets 
a downgrade or loss in credit ratings could have an impact on the corporation s ability to access wholesale funding at favorable interest rates 
as a result  capital ratios  asset quality measurements  and profitability ratios are monitored on an ongoing basis as part of the liquidity management process

diversity is achieved by strategically varying depositor type  term  funding market  and instrument 
as noted above  the parent company and certain subsidiary banks are rated by moody s  standard and poor s s p  and fitch 
these ratings  along with the corporation s other ratings  provide opportunity for greater funding capacity and funding alternatives 
the parent company manages its liquidity position to provide the funds necessary to pay dividends to shareholders  service debt  invest in subsidiaries  repurchase common stock  and satisfy other operating requirements 
the parent company s primary funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements are dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  borrowings with major banks  commercial paper issuance  and proceeds from the issuance of equity 
dividends received in cash from subsidiaries totaled million in and represent a primary funding source 
at december   million in dividends could be paid to the parent by its subsidiaries without obtaining prior regulatory approval  subject to the capital needs of the banks 
as discussed in item  the subsidiary banks are subject to regulation and  among other things  may be limited in their ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the parent company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available for the payment of cash dividends to the shareholders or for other cash needs 
in addition to dividends and service fees from subsidiaries  the parent company has multiple funding sources that could be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility 
these sources include a revolving credit facility  commercial paper  and two shelf registrations to issue debt and preferred securities or a combination thereof 
the parent company has available a million revolving credit facility with established lines of credit from nonaffiliated banks  of which million was available at december  in addition  million of commercial paper was available at december   under the parent company s million commercial paper program

the bank subsidiaries have a variety of funding sources in addition to key liquidity sources  such as core deposits  loan and investment portfolio repayments and maturities  and loan and investment portfolio sales available to increase financial flexibility 
a billion bank note program associated with associated bank  national association  was established during under this program  short term and long term debt may be issued 
as of december   million of long term bank notes and million of short term bank notes were outstanding 
at december   billion was available under this program 
the banks have also established federal funds lines with major banks totaling approximately billion and the ability to borrow from the federal home loan bank billion was outstanding at december  
in addition  the bank subsidiaries also accept eurodollar deposits  issue institutional certificates of deposit  and from time to time offer brokered certificates of deposit 
as reflected in table  the corporation has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and other commitments  which may require future cash payments 
the relatively shorter maturities in time deposits is not out of the ordinary to the corporation s experience of its customer base preference 
while the time deposits indicate shorter maturities and a declining trend largely due to the reduced attractiveness of time deposits in the prolonged low rate environment  liquidity was supported by strong growth in non time deposits 
continued strategic emphasis on deposit growth should further support this liquidity source 
the corporation has been purposely extending its long term funding sources primarily to take advantage of extending maturities in the low rate environment 
while this commits the corporation contractually to future cash payments  it is supportive of interest rate risk and liquidity management strategies 
as a financial services provider  the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk in the form of interest rate risk through other than trading activities 
market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
the corporation uses financial modeling techniques that measure the sensitivity of future earnings due to changing rate environments to measure interest rate risk 
policies established by the corporation s asset liability committee and approved by the board of directors limit exposure of earnings at risk 
general interest rate movements are used to develop sensitivity as the corporation feels it has no primary exposure to a specific point on the yield curve 
these limits are based on the corporation s exposure to a bp and bp immediate and sustained parallel rate move  either upward or downward 
interest rate risk in order to measure earnings sensitivity to changing rates  the corporation uses three different measurement tools static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and economic value of equity 
the static gap analysis starts with contractual repricing information for assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments 
these items are then combined with repricing estimations for administered rate interest bearing demand deposits  savings  and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets  and other liabilities to create a baseline repricing balance sheet 
in addition to the contractual information  residential mortgage whole loan products and mortgage backed securities are adjusted based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds that capture the expected prepayment of principal above the contractual amount based on how far away the contractual coupon is from market coupon rates 
the following table represents the corporation s consolidated static gap position as of december  table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  interest sensitivity period total within days days days year over year total in thousands earning assets loans held for sale    investment securities  at fair value       loans       interest rate swaps    other earning assets    total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits       other interest bearing liabilities       interest rate swaps    total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap       cumulative interest sensitivity gap    month cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  the interest rate sensitivity assumptions for demand deposits  savings accounts  money market accounts  and interest bearing demand deposit accounts are based on current and historical experiences regarding portfolio retention and interest rate repricing behavior 
based on these experiences  a portion of these balances are considered to be long term and fairly stable and are  therefore  included in the over year category 
for analysis purposes  brokered cds of million have been included with other interest bearing liabilities and excluded from interest bearing deposits 
interest rate swaps on funding are presented on a net basis 
the static gap analysis in table provides a representation of the corporation s earnings sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
it is a static indicator that does not reflect various repricing characteristics and may not necessarily indicate the sensitivity of net interest income in a changing interest rate environment 
at the end of  the corporation s balance sheet was asset sensitive to interest rate movements 
asset sensitive means that assets will reprice faster than liabilities 
in a rising rate environment  an asset sensitive bank will generally benefit 
during  the corporation remained asset sensitive as a result of issuing long term funding  growth in demand deposits  and shortening of the mortgage portfolio and investment portfolio due to faster prepayment experience 
interest rate risk of embedded positions including prepayment and early withdrawal options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  and cap and floor options within products require a more dynamic measuring tool to capture earnings risk 
earnings simulation and economic value of equity are used to more completely assess interest rate risk 
along with the static gap analysis  determining the sensitivity of short term future earnings to a hypothetical plus or minus bp and bp parallel rate shock can be accomplished through the use of simulation modeling 
in addition to the assumptions used to create the static gap  simulation of earnings includes the modeling of the balance sheet as an ongoing entity 
future business assumptions involving administered rate products  prepayments for future rate sensitive balances  and the reinvestment of maturing assets and liabilities are included 
these items are then modeled to project net interest income based on a hypothetical change in interest rates 
the resulting net interest income for the next month period is compared to the net interest income amount calculated using flat rates 
this difference represents the corporation s earnings sensitivity to a plus or minus bp parallel rate shock 
the resulting simulations for december   projected that net interest income would increase by approximately of budgeted net interest income if rates rose by a bp shock  and projected that the net interest income would decrease by approximately if rates fell by a bp shock 
at december   the bp shock up was projected to increase budgeted net interest income by approximately  and the bp shock down was projected to decrease budgeted net interest income by approximately 
economic value of equity is another tool used to measure the impact of interest rates on the present value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments 
this measurement is a longer term analysis of interest rate risk as it evaluates every cash flow produced by the current balance sheet 
the projected changes for earnings simulation and economic value of equity for both and were within the corporation s interest rate risk policy 
these results are based solely on immediate and sustained parallel changes in market rates and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors 
these factors may include changes in the shape of the yield curve  the change in spread between key market rates  or accounting recognition of the impairment of certain intangibles 
the above results are also considered to be conservative estimates due to the fact that no management action to mitigate potential income variances are included within the simulation process 
this action could include  but would not be limited to  delaying an increase in deposit rates  extending liabilities  using financial derivative products to hedge interest rate risk  changing the pricing characteristics of loans  or changing the growth rate of certain assets and liabilities 
the corporation uses interest rate derivative financial instruments as an asset liability management tool to hedge mismatches in interest rate exposure indicated by the net interest income simulation described above 
they are used to modify the corporation s exposures to interest rate fluctuations and provide more stable spreads between loan yields and the rate on their funding sources 
in  the corporation entered into million in notional amounts of new interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
table interest rate swap hedging portfolio notional balances and yield by maturity date notional weighted average weighted average maturity amount rate received rate paid in thousands less than year  years  years  over years  to hedge against rising interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate caps 
counterparties to these interest cap agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
at december   there were million of interest rate caps outstanding  which have a six month libor strike of 
to hedge against falling interest rates  the corporation may use interest rate floors 
like caps  counterparties to interest rate floor agreements pay the corporation based on the notional amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates 
there were no floors outstanding at december  derivative financial instruments are also discussed in note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities through the normal course of operations  the corporation has entered into certain contractual obligations and other commitments 
such obligations generally relate to funding of operations through deposits or debt issuances  as well as leases for premises and equipment 
as a financial services provider  the corporation routinely enters into commitments to extend credit 
while contractual obligations represent future cash requirements of the corporation  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans made by the corporation 
the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and other commitments at december  the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamoritized premiums or discounts  hedge basis adjustments  or other similar carrying value adjustments 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements 
table contractual obligations and other commitments note one year one to three to over reference or less three years five years five years total in thousands time deposits      long term funding and      operating leases      commitments to extend credit      total      the corporation also has obligations under its retirement plans as described in note  retirement plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation does not expect to make a contribution to its pension plan during due to the funded status of the plan 
the corporation also enters into derivative contracts under which the corporation is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair value of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
because the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under these contracts  these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  derivative and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant commitments at december   is as follows in thousands commitments to extend credit  excluding commitments to originate mortgage loans  commitments to originate residential mortgage loans held for sale  total commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  standby letters of credit  forward commitments to sell loans  further discussion of these commitments is included in note  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation may also have liabilities under certain contractual agreements contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
a discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the corporation may be held contingently liable  including guarantee arrangements  is included in note  commitments  off balance sheet risk  and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital stockholders equity at december   increased million to billion  or per share compared with per share at the end of stockholders equity is also described in note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in stockholders equity for was primarily composed of the retention of earnings and the exercise of stock options  with offsetting decreases to stockholders equity from the payment of cash dividends and the repurchase of common stock 
additionally  stockholders equity at year end included million of accumulated other comprehensive income versus million at december  the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income was predominantly related to a decrease in unrealized gains on securities available for sale due primarily to declines in the market value of mortgage related securities  lower unrealized losses on cash flow hedges  and a change in the additional pension obligation see note  retirement plans  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  net of the related tax effect

the adequacy of the corporation s capital is regularly reviewed to ensure that sufficient capital is available for current and future needs and is in compliance with regulatory guidelines 
the assessment of overall capital adequacy depends on a variety of factors  including asset quality  liquidity  stability of earnings  changing competitive forces  economic condition in markets served  and strength of management 
as of december  and  the corporation s tier risk based capital ratios  total risk based capital tier and tier ratios  and tier leverage ratios were in excess of regulatory minimum and well capitalized requirements 
it is management s intent to exceed the minimum requisite capital levels 
capital ratios are included in note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  and note  regulatory matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preferred securities qualify as tier capital for the corporation under federal reserve board guidelines 
as a result of recent accounting pronouncements  the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether deconsolidation of the trust will affect the qualification of the preferred securities as tier capital 
if it is determined that the preferred securities no longer qualify as tier capital  the effect of such a change is not expected to affect the corporation s well capitalized status 
the board of directors has authorized management to repurchase shares of the corporation s common stock each quarter in the market  to be made available for issuance in connection with the corporation s employee incentive plans and for other corporate purposes 
for the corporation s employee incentive plans  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares  shares per quarter in and of these authorizations  approximately million shares were repurchased for million during with approximately million shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised  while none were repurchased during with approximately million shares reissued in connection with stock options exercised 
additionally  under two separate actions in and one action in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase and cancellation of the corporation s outstanding shares  not to exceed approximately million shares on a combined basis 
under these authorizations  approximately million shares were repurchased for million during at an average cost of per share  while during approximately million shares were repurchased for million at an average cost of per share 
at december   approximately million shares remain authorized to repurchase 
the repurchase of shares will be based on market opportunities  capital levels  growth prospects  and other investment opportunities 
shares repurchased and not retired are held as treasury stock and  accordingly  are accounted for as a reduction of stockholders equity 
management believes that a strong capital position is necessary to take advantage of opportunities for profitable geographic and product expansion  and to provide depositor and investor confidence 
management actively reviews capital strategies for the corporation and each of its subsidiaries in light of perceived business risks  future growth opportunities  industry standards  and regulatory requirements 
it is management s intent to maintain an optimal capital and leverage mix for growth and for shareholder return
