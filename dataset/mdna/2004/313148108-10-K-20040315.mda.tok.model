item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial information as of and for each of the years ended december   and is consolidated to include the accounts of farmer mac and its wholly owned subsidiary  farmer mac mortgage securities corporation 
the following discussion should be read together with farmer mac s consolidated financial statements and is not necessarily indicative of future results 
forward looking statements certain statements made in this form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pertaining to management s current expectations as to farmer mac s future financial results  business prospects and business developments 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and typically are accompanied by  and identified with  such terms as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  should and similar phrases 
the following management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements addressing farmer mac s o prospects for earnings  o growth in loan purchase  guarantee  securitization and ltspc volume  o trends in net interest income  o trends in provisions for losses  o changes in capital position  and o other business and financial matters 
management s expectations for farmer mac s future necessarily involve a number of assumptions and estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties 
various factors could cause farmer mac s actual results or events to differ materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the forward looking statements  including uncertainties regarding o the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  o the possible establishment of additional statutory or regulatory restrictions or constraints on farmer mac that could hamper its growth or diminish its profitability  o legislative or regulatory developments or interpretations of farmer mac s statutory charter that could adversely affect farmer mac or the ability or motivation of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms of any such participation  or increase the cost of regulation and related corporate activities  o possible reaction in the financial markets to events involving government sponsored enterprises other than farmer mac  o farmer mac s access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms  o the possible effect of the risk based capital requirement  which could  under certain circumstances  be in excess of the statutory minimum capital requirement  o the rate of growth in agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o lender interest in farmer mac credit products and the farmer mac secondary market  o borrower preferences for fixed rate agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o competitive pressures in the purchase of agricultural mortgage loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage backed and debt securities  o substantial changes in interest rates  agricultural land values  commodity prices  export demand for us agricultural products and the general economy  o protracted adverse weather  market or other conditions affecting particular geographic regions or particular commodities related to agricultural mortgage loans backing farmer mac i guaranteed securities or under ltspcs  o the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage backed securities  or o the effects on the agricultural economy or the value of agricultural real estate of any changes in federal assistance for agriculture 
the foregoing factors are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely impact farmer mac s business and its financial performance 
furthermore  new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor assess the effects of such factors on farmer mac s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
in light of these potential risks and uncertainties  no undue reliance should be placed on any forward looking statements expressed in this report 
furthermore  farmer mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of revisions to any forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise mandated by the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policy and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of farmer mac s financial condition and results of operations and requires complex  subjective judgments is the accounting policy for the allowance for losses 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in four components on its consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  net of valuation allowance  o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into or modified after january   which is included in the balance sheet as a portion of the amount reported as guarantee and commitment obligation  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into prior to january   which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
the provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations o a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and o a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
the purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated losses that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date  and not to predict or account for future potential losses 
the determination of the allowance for losses requires management to make significant estimates based on information available as of the balance sheet date  including the amounts and timing of losses and current market and economic conditions 
these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change 
for example  a continued decline in the national or agricultural economy could result in an increase in delinquencies or foreclosures  which may require additional allowances for losses in future periods 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins with management s evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model the model 
the model draws upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans recorded over a longer period of time than farmer mac s own experience to date  screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those on which farmer mac has assumed credit risk 
the results generated by the model are modified by the application of management s judgment as required to take key factors into account  including o economic conditions  o geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations in farmer mac s portfolio  o the credit profile of farmer mac s portfolio  o delinquency trends of farmer mac s portfolio  o farmer mac s experience in the management and sale of real estate owned  and o historical charge off and recovery activities of farmer mac s portfolio 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
charge offs represent losses on the outstanding principal balance  any interest payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
to date  farmer mac has experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
further information regarding the allowance for losses is included in risk management credit risk loans 
results of operations overview 
net income available to common stockholders for rose to million or per diluted common share  compared to million or per diluted common share in and million or per diluted common share in farmer mac s growth continued in  with outstanding guarantee and ltspc volume as of december  that was million higher than at december  during  farmer mac o added million of farmer mac i eligible loans under ltspcs  o purchased million of newly originated farmer mac i eligible loans  and o purchased million of farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions of loans 
as of december   the percentage of farmer mac i loans purchased or placed under farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs after changes to farmer mac s statutory charter in that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy or classified as real estate owned  decreased to percent  compared to percent at the end of as farmer mac s portfolio of loans held and loans underlying ltspcs and post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities has had certain cohort years of loan originations enter  and now start exiting  their peak default years  segments of the portfolio are beginning to exhibit characteristics of a mature portfolio  which includes loans cycling through foreclosure and into the asset category real estate owned  which completes the involuntary loan liquidation process 
as of december   farmer mac had million of real estate owned  net of valuation allowance  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  during the foreclosure process farmer mac devises a liquidation strategy  based upon economics and local law  that results in either an immediate sale of the property or retention pending later sale 
the increase in real estate owned is the result of historical delinquencies in farmer mac s portfolio 
with the recent downward trend in delinquencies  management expects real estate owned to trend downward as well in future years 
farmer mac s portfolio also has developed a core of loans that  though the borrowers on those loans have filed for bankruptcy protection  are current under the original terms of the loans or as modified under a court approved bankruptcy plan 
non performing assets are loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy  or real estate owned 
day delinquencies are loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  or in bankruptcy  excluding loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan 
the difference between the non performing asset and day delinquencies measures is the exclusion of real estate owned and loans performing in bankruptcy from day delinquencies 
as of december  in thousands day delinquencies including loans in   foreclosure and loans restructured after delinquency loans performing in bankruptcy   real estate owned   non performing assets   the table below presents non performing assets and day delinquency data as of the dates indicated outstanding post act less loans  non reo and guarantees and performing performing day ltspcs assets percentage bankruptcies delinquencies percentage dollars in thousands december      september      june      march      december      september      june      march      december      september      june      march      farmer mac experienced million in net losses charged against the allowance for losses in  compared with million in net losses for and million in through direct charges to earnings  farmer mac provided for million in total losses during  compared to million during and million in farmer mac recorded gains on the sale of real estate owned of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
farmer mac s total allowance for losses as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  for further discussion of the increase in the allowance for losses and provision for losses  see risk management credit risk loans 
as of december   a significant portion of farmer mac s portfolio of post act farmer mac i loans and loans underlying ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities were in their peak default years 
accordingly  during the dollar level of day delinquencies could increase slightly and higher charge offs could follow  notwithstanding positive trends in the agricultural economy 
outlook for usda is currently forecasting o net cash farm income to be billion  billion lower than  but only slightly below the average of billion  o total direct government payments to be billion in  a decrease from the estimate of billion 
market prices for crops affect direct government payment rates for government programs  and usda anticipates program crop prices to be higher in  with prices for some crops at levels not seen in years  o demand for crop exports to be high  due to tight global supplies and the decline in the value of the dollar  which lowers the effective price of us commodities  o the value of us farm real estate to increase percent in to trillion  up from the forecast of trillion 
usda is anticipating improvement in the general economy to support further growth in farmland values  though at a rate slower than the annual average gain since  which exceeded percent  and o the value of farm real estate debt to increase by percent in to billion  up from billion in the usda forecast components referenced above relate to us agriculture generally  but should be favorable for farmer mac s business plans  as they indicate strong borrower cash flows  greater global demand for us commodities  and generally increased value of us farm real estate 
the last item in particular increases the mortgageable farm real estate base  the ability of borrowers to repay real estate debt and farmer mac s ability to recover in foreclosures 
as management evaluates farmer mac s business prospects for and beyond  certain factors and conditions remain that are likely to constrain farmer mac s progress 
as a matter of historical practice  and particularly in the current low interest rate and steep yield curve environment  many institutions still prefer to retain agricultural mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell them into the secondary market  notwithstanding the corporate finance and capital planning benefits they might realize through participation in farmer mac s programs  such as greater liquidity  greater lending capacity  increased return on equity and decreased capital requirements 
some lending institutions subsidize their agricultural mortgage loan rates out of higher rates on non mortgage loans  or by low return use of equity  both of which generate uneconomic competition with farmer mac s programs 
the rate of growth of farmer mac s business with many traditional portfolio lenders has been slowed by reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market 
see business volume for a description of factors affecting growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market 
with particular regard to farm credit system institutions  some business prospects have been constrained by increased insurance premiums assessed on loans held by those institutions  including loans under ltspcs  by the farm credit system insurance corporation fcsic  an independent us government controlled corporation managed by a three member board of directors composed of the members of the farm credit administration fca board with a different member serving as chairman 
in addition  fcsic has recently indicated to those institutions that they should be cautious about the risk of doing business with government sponsored enterprises  including farmer mac  as counterparties 
moreover  fcsic has raised objections to farm credit institutions use of farmer mac swaps  which generate farmer mac i guaranteed securities that are not subject to the previously mentioned insurance premiums 
notwithstanding slower growth in than in  farmer mac launched marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter of that are generating promising business opportunities for and beyond 
new and expanded business relationships including a strategic alliance with a related party farm credit system institution that will serve community banks  product enhancements  such as new open prepayment loan structures  and new loan securitization structures  are all underway 
while the continued growth in farmer mac s guarantees and ltspcs evidences significant progress in developing the secondary market for agricultural mortgages  farmer mac continues to face the challenges of establishing a new market where none previously existed 
acceptance of farmer mac s programs among lenders is based upon the competitive rates  terms and products offered  and the advantages farmer mac believes its programs provide 
as of december   farmer mac s outstanding program volume was billion  which represented percent of management s estimate of a billion market of eligible agricultural mortgage loans 
for farmer mac to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the longer term  the use of farmer mac s programs and products by agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  must continue to expand 
farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in prior years continue to exist  but no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions 
during and continuing in  farmer mac began several initiatives to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls  and accounting and financial reporting 
these initiatives are the result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the general regulatory environment for government sponsored enterprises 
a detailed presentation of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows 
net interest income 
net interest income was million for  million for and million for the net interest yield  which does not include guarantee fees for loans purchased prior to april  the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  was basis points for the year ended december   compared to basis points for the year ended december  and basis points for the year ended december  the effect of the adoption of sfas was a reclassification of approximately million basis points of guarantee fee income as interest income for the year ended december   compared to million basis points for the year ended december  and million one basis point for the year ended december  during third quarter  the chief accountant at the us securities and exchange commission provided additional guidance to all registrants regarding the classification on the statement of operations of realized gains and losses resulting from financial derivatives that are not in fair value or cash flow hedge relationships 
all registrants were requested to comply with this guidance in future filings and to reclassify this activity for all prior periods presented 
as a result of the application of this additional guidance  the net interest income and expense realized on financial derivatives that are not in fair value or cash flow hedge relationships have been reclassified from net interest income into gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
for the years ended december  and  this reclassification resulted in a decrease of the net interest yield of one basis point and a decrease of basis points  respectively 
the net interest yields for the years ended december   and included the benefits of yield maintenance payments received of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
yield maintenance payments represent the present value of expected future interest income streams and accelerate the recognition of interest income from the related loans 
because the timing and size of these payments vary greatly  variations should not be considered indicative of positive or negative trends to gauge future financial results 
for the years ended december   and  the after tax effects of yield maintenance payments on net income and diluted earnings per share were million or per diluted share  million or per diluted share and million or per diluted share  respectively 
the million decrease in net interest income from to was due principally to lower average spreads on cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the following table provides information regarding interest earning assets and funding for the years ended december   and the balance of non accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest earning loans presented  though no related income is included in the income figures presented 
therefore  as the balance of non accruing loans increases or decreases  the net interest yield will increase or decrease  accordingly 
net interest income and the yield will also fluctuate due to the uncertainty of the timing and size of yield maintenance payments 
average income average average income average average income average balance expense rate balance expense rate balance expense rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets cash and cash equivalents       investments       loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities       total interest earning assets       funding notes payable due within one year       notes payable due after one year       total interest bearing liabilities       net non interest bearing funding    total funding       net interest income yield    for  the decreases in all of the rates presented above tracked the general decline in interest rates relative to the prior year 
the average rates for cash and cash equivalents and discount notes reflect that decline in short term interest rates during  while the average rates for investments and loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities reflect the decline in interest rates for investments of similar term to the rate reset or maturity date 
the following table sets forth information regarding the changes in the components of farmer mac s net interest income for the periods indicated 
for each category  information is provided on changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by old rate and changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old volume 
combined rate volume variances  the third element of the calculation  are allocated based on their relative size

guarantee and commitment fee income  which compensate farmer mac for assuming the credit risk on loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  was million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in guarantee and commitment fee income reflects an increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees and ltspcs 
for  the effect of sfas reclassified million of guarantee fee income as interest income  although management considers that amount to have been earned in consideration for the assumption of credit risk 
that portion of the difference or spread between the cost of farmer mac s debt funding for loans and the yield on post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities held on its books compensates for credit and interest rate risk 
if a post act farmer mac i guaranteed security is sold to a third party  farmer mac continues to receive the guarantee fee component of that spread  which continues to compensate farmer mac for its assumption of credit risk 
the portion of the spread that compensates for interest rate risk would not typically continue to be received by farmer mac  except to the extent attributable to any retained interest only strip  if the asset were sold 
gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas requires the change in the fair values of financial derivatives to be reflected in a company s net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
sfas became effective as of january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles recognized during was a charge of million  net of taxes 
the net effect of financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and trading assets recorded in farmer mac s consolidated statements of operations was a net gain of million for  a net loss of million for and a net loss of million for on a net after tax basis  those gains and losses  combined with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles and benefits received from the elimination of the amortization of certain premium payments that resulted from sfas  increased net income available to common stockholders by million for and reduced net income available to common stockholders by million for gains on the sale of real estate owned 
farmer mac has reclassified items on its consolidated statements of operations to present more clearly the costs related to carrying its real estate owned and the gains or losses incurred upon it s the ultimate disposition of real estate owned 
previously  gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned were reflected as adjustments to the allowance for losses as either a charge off or recovery 
those amounts have been reclassified and are reported separately as gains or losses on the sale of real estate owned 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period classification 
gains on the sale of real estate owned were million  million and million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
miscellaneous income 
miscellaneous income was million for  compared to million for and million for both the decrease in miscellaneous income from to and the increase from to were primarily a result of the receipt of the high level of late fee income and processing fees on farmer mac ii refinance transactions received during expenses 
during and into  farmer mac began several initiatives to validate and enhance its risk management practices  internal controls  and accounting and financial reporting 
these initiatives are the result of ongoing corporate diligence and a number of regulatory considerations  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and fca requirements  as well as the general regulatory environment for government sponsored enterprises 
the general increases in both compensation and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses from to reflect the costs of those initiatives 
compensation and employee benefits were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  increased general and administrative expenses reflected higher legal and consulting fees associated with external events and publicity  these expenses dissipated somewhat in during  the reduction in legal and consulting fees was more than offset by higher costs of regulatory compliance and the costs of servicing loans nearing or in foreclosure or bankruptcy 
prospectively  the loan servicing costs are expected to fluctuate with the level of these categories of non performing assets  while the regulatory costs are expected to be ongoing 
regulatory fees were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
fca has advised farmer mac that its estimated assessment for is million 
the regulatory assessments from the fca for each of the examination periods corresponding approximately with each of the years ended december   and include both their originally estimated assessments and revisions to those estimates that reflect actual costs incurred 
these revisions have resulted in both additional assessments and refunds in the past 
real estate owned operating expenses were million and operating revenues were million for net real estate owned operating costs were million for these net costs increased from prior years nominal amounts as the number of properties owned increased 
farmer mac s provision for losses on loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is classified as a component of operating expenses  was million for  million for and million in farmer mac also provides for losses on the loans on its balance sheet through provisions that are charged against net interest income on the statement of operations and presented as a reduction to the reported loan balances on farmer mac s balance sheet 
the total amount provided for farmer mac s allowance for losses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the amount provided for the allowance for losses in decreased million from the amount provided in as a result of lower estimated probable losses during as of december   farmer mac s allowance for losses for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs was million  compared to million as of december  for further discussion and presentation regarding farmer mac s provisions for losses and allowances for losses in the aggregate  see risk management credit risk loans income tax expense 
income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in and million in farmer mac s effective tax rates for and were approximately percent and percent  respectively  reflecting the effects of certain tax advantaged investments  compared to percent for farmer mac expects its effective tax rate in to approximate percent 
for more information about income taxes  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses on the repurchase of debt 
during  farmer mac did not repurchase any of its outstanding debt 
during  farmer mac recognized million of net gains on the repurchase of million of its outstanding debt 
all of the repurchases were from outstanding farmer mac debt that had a maturity date of october  and an interest rate of percent 
those debt securities were replaced with new fixed rate funding to the same maturity dates at more attractive interest rates  which preserves farmer mac s asset liability match and reduced future interest expense 
non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac reports its financial results in accordance with gaap 
in addition to gaap measures  farmer mac presents certain non gaap performance measures 
farmer mac uses these non gaap performance measures to develop financial plans  to gauge corporate performance and to set incentive compensation 
as described below  because the financial accounting standards board fasb has adopted a mixed attribute accounting model that does not reflect the economics for transactions involving farmer mac s callable swaps  in management s view the non gaap measures provide a more accurate representation of farmer mac s economic performance  transaction economics and business trends 
investors and the investment analyst community have previously relied upon similar measures to evaluate performance and issue projections 
these non gaap disclosures are not intended to replace gaap information but  rather  to supplement it 
one such non gaap measure is core earnings  which farmer mac developed to present net income less the after tax effects of sfas and less the after tax net gains and losses on the repurchase of debt that  prior to january   were reported as extraordinary items 
core earnings for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings is presented in the following table reconciliation of gaap net income available to common stockholders to core earnings year ended december  december  december  in thousands gaap net income available to common stockholders    less the effects of sfas unrealized gains losses on financial derivatives and trading assets  net of tax   benefit from non amortization of premium payments on financial derivatives  net of tax cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas less gains on the repurchase of debt previously reported as extraordinary items core earnings    effects of sfas on accounting for callable interest rate swaps 
farmer mac enters into financial derivative transactions to protect against risk from the effects of market price or interest rate movements on the value of assets  future cash flows and debt issuance  not for trading or speculative purposes 
farmer mac enters into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the characteristics of its short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its longer term mortgage and other assets  and also to adjust the characteristics of its long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of its short term assets  thereby reducing interest rate risk and also to derive an overall lower effective fixed rate cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available to farmer mac in the conventional debt market 
specifically  interest rate swaps convert economically the variable cash flows related to the forecasted issuance of short term debt to effectively fixed rate medium term and long term notes that match the anticipated duration  repricing and interest rate characteristics of the corresponding assets 
since this strategy provides farmer mac with the same cash flows as those that are inherent in the issuance of medium term notes  farmer mac uses either the bond market or the swap market based upon their relative pricing efficiencies 
farmer mac uses callable interest rate swaps in conjunction with the issuance of short term debt as an alternative to callable medium term notes with equivalently structured maturities and call options 
the call options on the swaps are designed to match the implicit prepayment options on those mortgage assets without prepayment protection 
the blended durations of the swaps are also designed to match the duration of the mortgages over their estimated lives 
if the mortgages prepay  the swaps can be called and the short term debt repaid  if the mortgages do not prepay  the swaps remain outstanding and the short term debt is rolled over  effectively providing fixed rate callable funding over the lives of the mortgages 
thus  the economics of the assets are closely matched to the economics of the interest rate swap and funding combination 
the callable interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on farmer mac s balance sheet with the related changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
although farmer mac believes that this strategy achieves its economic and risk management objectives  the fasb has adopted a mixed attribute accounting model for callable swaps that does not reflect the economics of the transactions 
pursuant to that model  while the issuance of a callable medium term note is recorded at historical cost  the economic equivalent the issuance of short term debt with the forecasted rollover of that debt and the simultaneous issuance of a callable interest rate swap is recorded differently the discount notes are recorded at historical cost and the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value 
despite the closely matched economics and optionality of the assets and the associated interest rate swap and funding combination  the callable swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas because the test for hedge effectiveness under sfas is based on the linkage between the forecasted short term funding and the callable interest rate swap and ignores the prepayable characteristics of the associated assets being funded 
business volume 
loans are brought into the farmer mac i and farmer mac ii programs as follows o farmer mac purchases eligible loans and guarantees timely payments of principal and interest of securities backed by those loans as part of the farmer mac i program 
farmer mac may retain some or all of those securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions 
o farmer mac purchases usda guaranteed portions of loans and guarantees timely payments of principal and interest of securities backed by those guaranteed portions as part of the farmer mac ii program 
farmer mac may retain some or all of those securities in its portfolio or sell them to third parties in capital markets transactions 
o farmer mac also enters into ltspcs for eligible loans 
farmer mac s commitments through ltspcs include either newly originated or seasoned eligible loans  and are part of the farmer mac i program 
o farmer mac exchanges farmer mac guaranteed securities for eligible loans or usda guaranteed portions of loans swaps 
farmer mac s swaps of farmer mac guaranteed securities for usda guaranteed portions of loans are part of the farmer mac ii program  farmer mac s swaps of farmer mac guaranteed securities for any other eligible loans are part of the farmer mac i program 
during  the volume of loans purchased or placed under farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs totaled billion  a decrease from volume of billion 
that decrease was largely attributable to the purchase of a million loan portfolio in second quarter and a decrease in ltspc volume of million in  partially offset by an increase in farmer mac ii volume of million in see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i off balance sheet guarantees and commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of ltspcs 
the following table sets forth information regarding the volume of loans purchased or placed under farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs for the periods indicated farmer mac loan purchases  guarantees and ltspcs for the year ended december  in thousands farmer mac i loans and guaranteed securities    ltspcs    farmer mac ii    total    the purchase price of newly originated and seasoned eligible loans and portfolios purchased through the cash window  none of which are delinquent at the time of purchase  is the fair value based on current market interest rates and farmer mac s target net yield  which includes an amount to compensate farmer mac for credit risk that is similar to the guarantee or commitment fee it receives for accepting credit risk on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
the purchase price for loans purchased from all related parties is determined in the same manner as for loans acquired from any other third party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of related party transactions 
as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for farmer mac i guaranteed securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying ltspcs  farmer mac purchases defaulted loans  all of which are at least days delinquent at the time of purchase  out of those securities and pools 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased out of farmer mac i guaranteed securities is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an ltspc is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan  with accrued and unpaid interest on the defaulted loans payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation proceeds as received 
the purchase price of a defaulted loan is not an indicator of the expected loss on that loan  many other factors affect expected loss  if any  on loans so purchased 
see risk management credit risk loans 
the following table presents farmer mac s purchases of newly originated and current seasoned loans and purchases of defaulted loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
for the year ended december  in thousands farmer mac i newly originated and current seasoned loan purchases   defaulted loans purchased underlying off balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities   defaulted loans purchased underlying ltspcs   defaulted loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities transferred to loans   the decrease in newly originated and current seasoned loan purchases was attributable to a decrease in program volume that resulted primarily from the purchase of a million loan portfolio in second quarter  that was not replicated in the purchases of defaulted loans from farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs are pursuant to farmer mac s obligations as guarantor and under its contractual commitments  respectively 
with respect to the transfer of loans from on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities to loans  when particular criteria are met  such as the default of the borrower  farmer mac becomes entitled to purchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities commonly referred to as removal of account provisions 
farmer mac records these loans in the consolidated financial statements during the period in which farmer mac becomes entitled to repurchase the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans 
the weighted average age of the farmer mac i newly originated and current seasoned loans purchased during and was less than one year and years  respectively

this transaction resulted from the participant s exercise of a conversion feature incorporated in all existing ltspcs 
farmer mac s decision to retain the remainder of the loans it purchased was based on favorable underlying funding costs that resulted in attractive net interest income over the lives of the loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities it holds 
ltspcs typically involve seasoned loans  while cash purchase transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
the decreased ltspc activity in was a result of reduced growth rates in the agricultural mortgage market  which have tended to be a function of the interest rate environment and other factors described two paragraphs below 
with particular regard to farm credit system institutions  some business prospects have been constrained by increased fcsic insurance premiums assessed on loans held by those institutions  including loans under ltspcs 
in addition  fcsic has recently indicated to those institutions that they should be cautious about the risk of doing business with government sponsored enterprises  including farmer mac  as counterparties 
moreover  fcsic has raised objections to farm credit institutions use of farmer mac swaps  which generate farmer mac i guaranteed securities that are not subject to the previously mentioned insurance premiums 
notwithstanding this  management expects that ltspcs will continue to constitute a significant portion of new farmer mac i program activity during indicators of future loan purchase and guarantee volume through the cash window but not future ltspc  swap or portfolio purchase volume in the immediately succeeding reporting period include outstanding commitments to purchase loans other than under ltspcs and the total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased 
many purchase commitments entered into by farmer mac are mandatory delivery commitments 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to modify  extend or cancel the commitment 
as of december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i and farmer mac ii loans totaled million  compared to million as of december  of the total farmer mac i and ii commitments outstanding as of december  and  million and million  respectively  were mandatory commitments 
loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  not all of such loans are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
new business volume was down during compared to farmer mac believes this trend is traceable to o general conditions in the agricultural mortgage market affecting agricultural mortgage lenders  including payments received by farmers under the farm bill and lower short term interest rates  that have resulted in reduced borrower inclination to finance their real estate assets  particularly at long term fixed rates  o diminished expansion in the capital intensive livestock and permanent crop sectors that have  in the past  been significant sources of new business for farmer mac  o adverse publicity about and increased regulatory pressure on government sponsored enterprises  including farmer mac  and o increased fcsic insurance premiums on loans held by farm credit system institutions and fcsic indications regarding counterparty risk  as discussed above 
nonetheless  lender interest in farmer mac produced a consistent stream of new volume in the form of farmer mac i and ii individual loan purchases and additions to existing ltspc arrangements during in the fourth quarter of  farmer mac launched marketing initiatives that are generating promising business opportunities for and beyond 
new and expanded business relationships including a strategic alliance with a related party farm credit system institution that will serve community banks  product enhancements  such as new open prepayment loan structures  and new loan securitization structures  are all underway 
farmer mac believes that prospects for larger portfolio transactions similar to those that have accounted for a significant portion of growth in prior years continue to exist  but no assurance can be given at this time as to the certainty or timing of such transactions 
as of december   there were approved loan sellers in the farmer mac i program ranging from single office to multi branch institutions  spanning community banks  farm credit system associations  mortgage companies  large multi state farm credit system banks  commercial banks and insurance companies  of which were active participants in the program 
as of december   there were approved sellers in the farmer mac i program  of which were active participants in the program 
in addition to participating directly in the farmer mac i program  some of the approved loan sellers enable other lenders to participate indirectly in the farmer mac i program by managing correspondent networks of lenders from which they purchase loans to sell to farmer mac 
as of december   more than lenders were participating in those networks  bringing the total farmer mac i program participants to more than as of december  to be considered for approval as a farmer mac i seller  a financial institution must meet criteria established by farmer mac  including o owning a requisite amount of farmer mac class a or class b voting common stock according to a schedule prescribed for the size and type of institution  o having the ability and experience to make or purchase and sell agricultural mortgage loans of the type that will qualify for purchase by farmer mac and service such mortgage loans in accordance with the farmer mac requirements either through its own staff or through contractors and originators  o maintaining a minimum adjusted net worth of million  o maintaining a fidelity bond and errors and omissions insurance coverage or acceptable substitute insurance coverage in a prescribed amount according to the size of the institution  and o entering into a seller servicer agreement to comply with the terms of the farmer mac seller servicer guide  including representations and warranties regarding the eligibility of the loans and accuracy of loan data provided to farmer mac 
any lender authorized by the usda to obtain a usda guarantee on a loan may be a seller in the farmer mac ii program 
as of december   there were active sellers in the farmer mac ii program  compared to as of december  sellers in the farmer mac ii program consist mostly of community and regional banks 
thus  in the aggregate  more than lenders were actively participating either directly or indirectly in one or both of the farmer mac i or farmer mac ii programs during related party transactions 
in and  farmer mac conducted business with entities that are related parties as a result of a member of farmer mac s board of directors being affiliated with the entity in some capacity 
these transactions were conducted in the ordinary course of business  with terms and conditions comparable to those available to any other third party

off balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac offers approved agricultural and rural residential mortgage lenders two alternatives to increase their liquidity or lending capacity while retaining the cash flow benefits of their loans farmer mac guaranteed securities  which are available through either the farmer mac i program or the farmer mac ii program  and ltspcs  which are available only through the farmer mac i program 
both of these alternatives result in off balance sheet transactions for farmer mac 
to be eligible for the farmer mac i program  a loan must meet farmer mac s credit underwriting  appraisal and documentation standards 
accordingly  farmer mac believes the credit risk it assumes for farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by loans that are eligible for the farmer mac i program and for ltspcs is the same and considers the effects of all on and off balance sheet activities on its overall portfolio diversification and credit risk 
see note to farmer mac s consolidated financial statements for more detail on the corporation s off balance sheet program activities

risk management interest rate risk 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to loans held and on balance sheet farmer mac guaranteed securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities  thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing interest rate environment can reduce the earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties contained in many agricultural mortgage loans reduce  but do not eliminate  this risk  particularly in the case of a defaulted loan where yield maintenance may not be collected 
those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when they prepay their loans  so that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
this provision creates a disincentive to prepayment and compensates the corporation for its interest rate risks to a large degree 
as of december   percent of the outstanding balance of all loans held and loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates were covered by yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties 
as of december   percent of the total outstanding balance of retained farmer mac i loans and guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions and percent had other forms of prepayment protection 
of the farmer mac i new and current loans purchased in  percent had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment protection including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates 
none of the usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions 
taking into consideration the prepayment provisions and the default probabilities associated with its mortgage assets  farmer mac uses prepayment models to project and value cash flows associated with these assets 
because borrowers behavior in various interest rate environments may change over time  farmer mac periodically evaluates the effectiveness of these models compared to actual prepayment experience and adjusts and refines the models as necessary to improve the precision of subsequent prepayment forecasts 
in addition  farmer mac consults with independent prepayment experts as part of the model evaluation process 
the goal of interest rate risk management at farmer mac is to create and maintain a portfolio that generates stable earnings and value across a variety of interest rate environments 
farmer mac s primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar durations so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change 
to achieve this match  farmer mac issues discount notes and both callable and non callable medium term notes across a spectrum of maturities 
farmer mac issues callable debt to offset the prepayment risk associated with some mortgage assets 
by using a blend of liabilities that includes callable debt  the interest rate sensitivities of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets 
farmer mac also uses financial derivatives to alter the duration of its assets and liabilities to better match their durations  thereby reducing overall interest rate sensitivity 
farmer mac s million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  matures within three months and is match funded with discount notes having similar maturities 
investment securities of billion as of december  consist of million percent of floating rate securities that all have rates that adjust within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on investment securities 
these floating rate investments are funded using i a series of discount note issuances in which each successive discount note is issued and matures on or about the corresponding repricing date of the related investment  ii floating rate notes having similar rate reset provisions as the related investment  or iii fixed rate notes swapped to floating rates having similar reset provisions as the related investment 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans that farmer mac has committed to acquire other than through ltspcs but has not yet purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase such loans  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loans and the time it either o sells farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by the loans  or o issues debt to retain the loans in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loans as investments does not fully eliminate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and any related farmer mac guaranteed securities or debt issuance  through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage backed securities of other government sponsored enterprises and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
farmer mac uses forward sale contracts on government sponsored enterprise securities to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and spreads on farmer mac debt and farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
since interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as interest rates change  farmer mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary through o the purchase of mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business  o the refunding of existing liabilities  or o the use of derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets or liabilities 
the most strenuous measure of the long term interest rate risk of farmer mac s current portfolio is the sensitivity of its market value of equity mve to yield curve shocks 
mve represents the present value of all future cash flows from on and off balance sheet assets  liabilities and financial derivatives  discounted at current interest rates and spreads 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis as of december  and december  to an immediate and instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve 
percentage change in mve from base case interest rate december  december  scenario bp bp bp bp bp n a n a bp n a n a as of december  and  a bp parallel shift of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve produced negative interest rates for maturities of years and shorter 
farmer mac s long term interest rate sensitivity decreased during  and remained relatively stable and at relatively low levels despite the volatile interest rate environment during the year 
farmer mac s effective duration gap was minus months as of december   compared to minus months as of december  as interest rates declined during  prepayments of mortgages without prepayment penalties increased  thereby shortening the duration of the corporation s assets relative to the duration of its liabilities 
throughout the year  farmer mac shortened the duration of its liabilities through various rebalancing strategies 
as a result  farmer mac was able to improve its overall risk profile even as interest rates declined to historic lows 
as of december   a uniform or parallel increase of basis points would have increased nii by percent  while a parallel decrease of basis points would have decreased nii by percent 
farmer mac also measures the sensitivity of both mve and nii to a variety of non parallel interest rate shocks  including flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios 
as of december   both mve and nii showed similar sensitivity to non parallel shocks as to the parallel shocks 
the sensitivity of farmer mac s mve and nii to both parallel and non parallel interest rate shocks  and its duration gap  indicate the effectiveness of farmer mac s approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures 
the economic effects of financial derivatives  including interest rate swaps  are included in the mve  nii and duration gap analyses 
farmer mac generally enters into various interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk as follows o floating to fixed interest rate swaps in which it pays fixed rates of interest to  and receives floating rates of interest from  counterparties  these swaps adjust the characteristics of short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of longer term reset and fixed rate mortgages and other assets and provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market  o fixed to floating interest rate swaps in which it receives fixed rates of interest from  and pays floating rates of interest to  counterparties  these transactions adjust the characteristics of long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of short term assets  and o basis swaps in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one index to  and receives variable rates of interest based on another index from  counterparties  these swaps alter interest rate indices of liabilities to match those of assets  and vice versa 
as of december   farmer mac had billion combined notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million were floating to fixed interest rate swaps  million were floating to floating interest rate swaps  million were basis swaps and million were fixed to floating interest rate swaps  with terms ranging from one to fifteen years 
farmer mac uses financial derivatives as an end user for hedging purposes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
when financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria under sfas  they are accounted for as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
financial derivatives that do not satisfy those hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial derivatives and trading assets in the consolidated statement of operations 
all of farmer mac s financial derivatives transactions are conducted under standard collateralized agreements that limit farmer mac s potential credit exposure to any counterparty 
as of december   farmer mac had no uncollateralized net exposure to any counterparty 
credit risk loans 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages in conjunction with a deficiency in the value of the collateral relative to the amount outstanding on the mortgage and the cost of liquidation 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on o loans it holds  o loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities  and o loans underlying ltspcs 
loans held or loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs can be divided into four groups o loans held for investment  o loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  o loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs  and o usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
for loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  ten percent first loss subordinated interests mitigate farmer mac s credit risk exposure 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac generally assumes percent of the credit risk on loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s credit exposure on usda guaranteed portions is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities because of the subordinated interests  or to usda guaranteed portions because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held  real estate owned and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities including agvantage bonds or ltspcs is summarized in the table below 
as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act   pre act   farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions   for several years  farmer mac has conducted guarantee fee adequacy analyses  using stress test models developed internally and with the assistance of outside experts 
these analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar characteristics of the various asset categories for which farmer mac manages its risk exposures  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new asset categories 
based on current information  farmer mac believes that its guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes 
farmer mac has established underwriting  appraisal and documentation standards for agricultural mortgage loans to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and to provide guidance concerning the management  administration and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all participating sellers and potential sellers in its programs 
these standards were developed on the basis of industry norms for agricultural mortgage loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower  as well as the value of the collateral securing the loan 
farmer mac requires sellers to make representations and warranties regarding the conformity of eligible mortgage loans to these standards  the accuracy of loan data provided to farmer mac and other requirements related to the loans 
sellers are responsible to farmer mac for breaches of those representations and warranties that result in economic losses to the corporation 
pursuant to contracts with farmer mac and in consideration for underwriting and servicing fees  farmer mac approved central servicers underwrite mortgage loans for farmer mac in accordance with those standards and other requirements  and service those loans in accordance with farmer mac requirements 
central servicers are responsible to farmer mac for serious errors in the underwriting and servicing of those mortgage loans 
detailed information regarding farmer mac s underwriting and appraisal standards and seller eligibility requirements are presented in business farmer mac programs farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards and business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  as amended 
the methodology for determining the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs because farmer mac believes the ultimate credit risk is substantially the same  ie  the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting and appraisal standards 
for accepting the credit risk on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  farmer mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees  respectively 
for loans held  farmer mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to its guarantee fee  which farmer mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
to date  farmer mac has experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is presented in four components on its consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned  net of valuation allowance  o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into or modified after january   which is included in the balance sheet as a portion of the amount reported as guarantee and commitment obligation  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs entered into prior to january   which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
the provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations o a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and o a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
farmer mac estimates probable losses using a systematic process that begins with management s evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model the model 
the model draws upon historical information from a data set of agricultural mortgage loans recorded over a longer period of time than farmer mac s own experience to date  screened to include only those loans with credit characteristics similar to those on which farmer mac has assumed credit risk 
the results generated by the model are modified by the application of management s judgment  as required to take key factors into account  including o economic conditions  o geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations in farmer mac s portfolio  o the credit profile of farmer mac s portfolio  o delinquency trends of farmer mac s portfolio  o farmer mac s experience in the management and sale of real estate owned  and o historical charge off and recovery activities of farmer mac s portfolio 
management believes that its use of this methodology produces a reliable estimate of total probable losses  as of the balance sheet date  for all loans included in farmer mac s portfolio  including loans held  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s methodology for determining its allowance for losses will migrate over time away from the model  to become based on farmer mac s own historical portfolio loss experience 
until that time  farmer mac will continue to use the results from the model  augmented by the application of management s judgment  to determine its allowance for losses 
in addition  farmer mac specifically analyzes its portfolio of non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy  including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan  and real estate owned on a loan by loan basis 
this analysis measures impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for each individual loan relative to the total amount due  including principal  interest and advances under sfas in the event that the updated appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value does not support the total amount due  farmer mac specifically determines an allowance for the loan for the difference between the recorded investment and its fair value  less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral 
for this analysis and the allocation of specific reserves as of december   farmer mac expanded the population of loans specifically reviewed to include o non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned  o loans for which farmer mac had adjusted the timing of borrowers payment schedules within the past three years  but still expects to collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions  and o additional performing loans that have previously been delinquent or are secured by real estate that produces commodities currently under stress 
management believes that the general allowance  which is the difference between the total allowance for losses generated through use of the model and the specific allowances  adequately covers any losses inherent in the portfolio of performing loans under sfas farmer mac believes that the methodology described above produces a reliable estimate of the total probable losses inherent in farmer mac s portfolio 
the model o uses historical agricultural real estate loan origination and servicing data that reflect varied economic conditions and stress levels in the agricultural sector  o contains features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio characteristics to make the data set more representative of farmer mac s portfolio and credit underwriting standards  and o considers the effects of the ageing of the loan portfolio along the expected loss curves associated with individual origination years  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of their peak default years 
farmer mac analyzes various iterations of the model data and considers various configurations of loan types  terms  economic conditions and borrower eligibility criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for all loans in the portfolio  all to evaluate its overall allowance for losses  and back tests the results to validate the model 
such tests use prior period data to project losses expected in a current period and compare those projections to actual losses incurred during the current period 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses charged to operating expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries that are recognized if liquidation proceeds exceed previous estimates 
charge offs represent losses on the outstanding principal balance  any interest payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation 
the establishment of and periodic adjustments to the valuation allowance for real estate owned are charged against income as a portion of the provision for losses charged to operating expense 
gains and losses on the sale of real estate owned are recorded in income based on the difference between the recorded investment at the time of sale and liquidation proceeds 
the following table summarizes the changes in the components of farmer mac s allowance for losses for each year in the three year period ended december  contingent allowance reo obligation total for loan valuation reserve for probable allowance losses allowance for losses losses for losses in thousands balances as of january    provision for losses   net allocation of allowance net recoveries charge offs   balances as of december     provision for losses    net allocation of allowance    net charge offs   balances as of december     provision for losses      net charge offs    balances as of december      during third quarter  farm credit west  aca  a related party program participant  exercised the conversion feature incorporated in all existing ltspcs and farmer mac converted that participant s million ltspc into a farmer mac i guaranteed security in a swap transaction 
in accordance with fin  farmer mac recorded the fair value of its obligation to stand ready to perform under the new farmer mac guaranteed security 
the fair value of this obligation includes farmer mac s estimate of the losses that are anticipated over the life of each contractual obligation 
the change in accounting for this obligation  from a probable loss model to a fair value model  has resulted in a reduction in the reserve for losses of approximately million 
since farmer mac believes that these losses remain probable  they have been included in the determination of the fair value of the contractual obligation and therefore there was no reduction in the total allowance for losses 
when certain criteria are met  such as the default of the borrower  farmer mac may  in its sole discretion  repurchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and is obligated to purchase those underlying an ltspc 
these acquisitions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at their fair value 
fair value is determined by appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value 
in september  farmer mac adopted eitf issue  accounting for changes that result in a transferor regaining control of financial assets sold the consensus or eitf 
the consensus requires that farmer mac record  at acquisition  the difference between each loan s acquisition cost and its fair value  if any  as a charge to the reserve for losses 
prior to the adoption of the consensus  any specific allowance that had been established for the off balance sheet obligation would have been transferred from the reserve for losses to the allowance for loan losses referred to as net allocation of the allowance in the table above 
upon the receipt of each loan s updated appraisal or determination of management s estimate of discounted collateral value  the difference between the acquisition cost of the loan and its fair value  if any  was recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
farmer mac s total provision for losses was million for  compared to million for during  farmer mac charged off million in losses against the allowance for losses and recovered million on the sale of real estate owned

as of december   farmer mac s day delinquencies totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  from quarter to quarter  farmer mac anticipates the day delinquencies will fluctuate  both in dollars and as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters of each year corresponding to the semi annual january st and july st payment characteristics of most farmer mac i loans 
as of december   loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned post act non performing assets totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  loans that have been restructured after delinquency were insignificant and are included within the reported day delinquency and non performing asset disclosures

as of december   approximately billion percent of farmer mac s outstanding loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs were in their peak delinquency and default years compared to billion percent of such loans as of december  the model takes the portfolio age distribution and maturation into consideration 
accordingly  those trends did not cause management to alter the model s projection for the provisions for losses 
as of december   farmer mac analyzed the following three categories of assets for impairment  based on the fair value of the underlying collateral o million of non performing assets  o million of loans for which farmer mac has adjusted the timing of borrowers payment schedules within the past three years  but still expects to collect all amounts due and has not made economic concessions  and o million of performing loans that have previously been delinquent or are secured by real estate that produces commodities currently under stress 
those individual assessments covered a total of million of assets measured for impairment against updated appraised values  other updated collateral valuations or discounted values 
of the million of assets analyzed  million were adequately collateralized 
for the million that were not adequately collateralized  individual collateral shortfalls totaled million 
accordingly  farmer mac allocated specific allowances of million to those under collateralized assets as of december  as of december   after the allocation of specific allowances to under collateralized loans  farmer mac had additional non specific or general allowances of million  bringing the total allowance for losses to million

based on farmer mac s loan by loan analyses  loan collection experience and continuing provisions for the allowance for losses  farmer mac believes that ongoing losses will be covered adequately by the allowance for losses 
original loan to value ratios are one of many factors farmer mac considers in evaluating loss severity 
other factors include  but are not limited to  other underwriting standards  commodity and agricultural economic forecasts 
loans in the farmer mac i program are all first mortgage agricultural real estate loans 
accordingly  farmer mac s exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the total of the accrued interest  advances and the principal balance of a loan and the value of the property 
measurement of that excess or shortfall is the best predictor and determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator 
loan to value ratios depend upon the market value of a property with due regard for its income producing potential 
as required by farmer mac s collateral valuation standards  an appraisal of agricultural real estate must include analysis of the income producing capability of the property and address the income estimate in the market analysis 
debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage  which can vary widely within a geographic region  commodity type  or an operator s business and farming skills 
as of december   the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs was percent  and the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act non performing assets was percent 
the following table summarizes the post act non performing assets by original loan to value ratio calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or  when available  updated appraised value at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment distribution of post act non performing assets by original ltv ratio as of december  dollars in thousands post act non performing original ltv ratio assets percentage to  to  to  to  to  total  the following table presents outstanding loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  post act non performing assets and specific allowances for losses as of december  by year of origination  geographic region and commodity

an analysis of farmer mac s historical losses and identified specific collateral deficiencies within the portfolio by origination year indicates that farmer mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination  regardless of the year the loans were added to farmer mac s portfolio 
as a consequence of the combination of principal amortization and collateral value appreciation  there are few loans in the portfolio originated prior to with known collateral deficiencies 
while farmer mac expects that there will be loans that have aged past their fifth year that will become delinquent and possibly default  farmer mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans 
analysis of portfolio performance by commodity distribution indicates that losses and collateral deficiencies have been and are expected to remain less prevalent in the loans secured by real estate producing agricultural commodities that receive significant government support such as cotton  soybeans  wheat and corn and more prevalent in those that do not receive such support 
this analysis is consistent with corresponding commodity analysis  which indicates that farmer mac has experienced higher loss and collateral deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings 
the loans classified as permanent plantings do not receive significant government support and are therefore more susceptible to adverse commodity specific economic trends 
further  as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular commodity that requires a long term improvement on the land  such as permanent plantings  the prospective sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related loans may become under collateralized 
farmer mac anticipates that one or more particular commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate concentration risks while preserving farmer mac s ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups 
analysis of portfolio performance by geographic distribution indicates that  while commodities are the primary determinant of exposure to loss  within most commodity groups certain geographic areas allow greater economies of scale or proximity to markets than others and  consequently  result in more successful farms within the commodity group 
likewise  certain geographic areas offer better growing conditions than others and  consequently  result in more versatile and more successful farms within a given commodity group and the ability to switch crops among commodity groups 
farmer mac s methodologies for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees  managing credit risks and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing factors and information 
credit risk institutional 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk arising from its business relationships with other institutions including o issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  o sellers and servicers  and o interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the issuers of the agvantage bonds 
outstanding agvantage bonds totaled million as of december   and million as of december  farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring those institutions to meet farmer mac s standards for creditworthiness 
farmer mac monitors the financial condition of those institutions by evaluating financial statements and bank credit rating agency reports and confirms that they maintain adequate fidelity bonds and errors and omissions insurance 
for more information on farmer mac s approval of sellers  see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i sellers 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in risk management interest rate risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk other investments 
the credit risk inherent in other investments held by farmer mac is mitigated by farmer mac s policies of investing in highly rated instruments and establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policies limit the corporation s total credit exposure  including uncollateralized credit exposure resulting from financial derivatives  to a single entity by limiting the dollar amount of investments with each individual entity to the greater of percent of farmer mac s regulatory core capital or million 
that limitation excludes exposure to agencies of the us government  government sponsored enterprises and money market funds 
farmer mac policy also requires each individual entity to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories of at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization for investments with terms greater than days and in one of the two highest rating categories for investments with terms of days or less 
as of december   farmer mac had investments in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities  municipal bonds  and preferred stock issued by forty five entities totaling million 
farmer mac s investments in eighteen of these entities each exceeded percent of farmer mac s core capital the cumulative balance of investments in such entities totaled million  and investments in two of these entities each exceeded percent of core capital 
in addition  as of december   farmer mac held million of securities issued by government sponsored enterprises or agencies of the us government and million in three money market investment accounts 
the maximum amount held in any one money market fund investment fund at any time during was approximately million 
as of december   percent of the investment portfolio  excluding government sponsored enterprise and agency investments  consisted of short term highly liquid investments 
liquidity and capital resources farmer mac has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to support its operations for the next twelve months and has a contingency funding plan to handle unanticipated disruptions in its access to the capital markets 
debt issuance 
section e of farmer mac s statutory charter usc ss 
aa e authorizes farmer mac to issue debt obligations to purchase eligible mortgage loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities and to maintain reasonable amounts for business operations  including adequate liquidity 
farmer mac funds its program purchases primarily by issuing debt obligations of various maturities in the public capital markets 
farmer mac s debt obligations consist of discount notes and medium term notes issued to obtain funds principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding loans and securities including farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac also issues discount notes and medium term notes to obtain funds for investments  transaction costs and guarantee payments 
the corporation s discount notes and medium term notes are obligations of farmer mac only  are not rated by any rating agency and the interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts or obligations of the farm credit administration or the united states or any agency or instrumentality of the united states other than farmer mac 
farmer mac is an institution of the farm credit system  but is not liable for any debt or obligation of any other institution of the farm credit system 
likewise  neither the farm credit system nor any other individual institution of the farm credit system is liable for any debt or obligation of farmer mac 
income on farmer mac s discount notes and medium term notes has no exemption under federal law from federal  state or local taxation 
farmer mac s board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to billion of discount notes and medium term notes of which billion was outstanding as of december   subject to periodic review of the adequacy of that level relative to farmer mac s borrowing requirements 
farmer mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and non program investment assets in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors 
liquidity 
the funding and liquidity needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase and retention of loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities  the maturities of farmer mac s discount notes and medium term notes and payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are o principal and interest payments and ongoing guarantee and commitment fees received on loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  o principal and interest payments received from investment securities  and o the issuance of new discount notes and medium term notes 
farmer mac projects its expected cash flows from loans and securities  other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its obligations to retire debt and pay other liabilities as they come due 
farmer mac issues discount notes and medium term notes to meet the needs associated with its business operaions  including liquidity  and also to increase its presence in the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing efficiency of its discount notes and medium term notes and farmer mac guaranteed securities transactions and so improve the mortgage rates available to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners 
though farmer mac s mortgage purchases do not currently necessitate daily debt issuance  the corporation continued its strategy of using its non program investment portfolio referred to as farmer mac s liquidity portfolio to facilitate increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets during to meet investor demand for daily presence in the capital markets  farmer mac issues discount notes in maturities principally ranging from one day to approximately days and invests the proceeds not needed for program asset purchases in highly rated securities 
investments are predominantly short term money market securities with maturities closely matched to the discount note maturities and floating rate securities with reset terms of less than one year and closely matched to the maturity of the discount notes 
the positive spread earned from these investments enhances the net interest income farmer mac earns  thereby improving the net yields at which farmer mac can purchase mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners through the farmer mac programs 
subject to dollar amount  issuer concentration and credit quality limitations  the corporation s board of directors has authorized non program investments in o us treasury obligations  o agency and instrumentality obligations  o repurchase agreements  o commercial paper  o guaranteed investment contracts  o certificates of deposit  o federal funds and bankers acceptances  o securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers  o asset backed securities  o corporate money market funds  and o preferred stock of government sponsored enterprises 
as of december   farmer mac was in compliance with the investment authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines 
the following table presents farmer mac s five largest investments as of december  security credit recorded percent of investment issuer rating investment core capital dollars in thousands merrill lynch premier merrill lynch co  inc n a  institutional fund federated prime value federated group inc n a  obligations fund dreyfus cash management dreyfus corp

as a result of farmer mac s regular issuance of discount notes and medium term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the united states  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
farmer mac has also used floating to fixed interest rate swaps  combined with discount note issuances  as a source of fixed rate funding 
while the swap market may provide favorable fixed rates  swap transactions expose farmer mac to the risk of future widening of its own issuance spreads versus corresponding libor rates 
if the spreads on the farmer mac discount notes were to increase relative to libor  farmer mac would be exposed to a commensurate reduction on its net interest yield on the notional amount of its floating to fixed interest rate swaps and other libor based floating rate assets 
farmer mac compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield on program asset purchases to reflect the cost of medium term notes without regard to the savings that may be achievable in the interest rate swap market 
farmer mac maintains a liquidity investment portfolio of cash and cash equivalents including commercial paper and other short term money market instruments and investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice within one year  which can be drawn upon for liquidity needs 
as of december   farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities totaled million and  million  respectively  a combined percent of total assets and percent of total notes payable 
in addition  as of december   farmer mac held a million portfolio of farmer mac ii guaranteed securities backed by usda guaranteed portions that carry the full faith and credit of the us government 
as of december   the aggregate of the farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and the liquidity investment portfolio represented percent of total assets and percent of total notes payable 
during  exclusive of daily overnight discount note issuances the proceeds of which were invested overnight  the average discount note issuance term and re funding frequency was approximately days 
the principal sources of funding for farmer mac s obligations under its guarantees and ltspcs are o the ongoing fees received on its guarantees and commitments o net interest income received on loans and guaranteed securities  and o the proceeds of debt issuance 
farmer mac satisfies its guarantee and purchase commitment obligations by purchasing defaulted loans out of ltspcs and from the related trusts for farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac typically recovers a significant portion of the value of defaulted loans purchased either through borrower payments  loan payoffs  payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale 
farmer mac s liquidity position and ready access to the debt markets also provide additional flexibility to meet liquidity needs that result from the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of required purchases of loans underlying either farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs  should significantly more loans be required to be purchased than in prior periods 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using specified stress test parameters 
for a discussion of risk based capital  see business government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards general 
certain enforcement powers are given to fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see business government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  and based on the fully phased in requirements 
december  december  capital capital amount ratio required amount ratio required dollars in thousands on balance sheet assets as defined for determining statutory minimum capital     outstanding balance of farmer mac guaranteed securities held by others and ltspcs     derivative and hedging obligations   minimum capital level   actual core capital   capital surplus   based on the statutory minimum capital requirements  farmer mac s current capital surplus of million would support additional guarantee growth in amounts ranging from billion of on balance sheet guarantees to more than billion of off balance sheet guarantees and commitments 
furthermore  farmer mac could sell billion of on balance sheet non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investment securities and billion of on balance sheet program assets in order to support further increases of on and off balance sheet program guarantees and commitments 
any of these transactions would be evaluated for compliance with risk based capital requirements and to optimize farmer mac s return on equity and capital flexibility 
accordingly  in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient capital and liquidity for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table presents the amount and timing of farmer mac s known fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date as of december  the payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying value adjustments

see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding farmer mac s minimum lease payments for office space 
includes minimum amounts due under non cancelable agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms 
these agreements include agreements for the provision of internal audit services  consulting services  information technology support  equipment maintenance  and financial analysis software and services 
the amounts actually paid under these agreements will likely be higher due to the variable components of some of these agreements under which the ultimate obligation owed is determined by reference to actual usage or hours worked 
the table does not include amounts due under agreements that are cancelable without penalty or further payment as of december  and therefore do not represent enforceable and legally binding obligations 
the table also does not include amounts due under the terms of employment agreements with members of senior management 
see the tables below in this section for information about farmer mac s commitments to purchase loans and farmer mac s contingent obligations under outstanding farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac enters into financial derivative contracts under which it either receives cash from counterparties  or is required to pay cash to them  depending on changes in interest rates 
financial derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  representing the net present value of expected future cash payments or receipts based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
because the financial derivative liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid under the financial derivative contracts  those liabilities are not included in the table of contractual obligations presented above 
further information regarding financial derivatives is included in note h and note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conducting its loan purchase activities  farmer mac enters into mandatory and optional delivery commitments to purchase agricultural mortgages and corresponding optional commitments to deliver farmer mac guaranteed securities

farmer mac also may have liabilities that arise from its farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac guaranteed securities are issued through trusts and  when sold to third party investors  accordingly  are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
in performing its obligations related to ltspcs and farmer mac guaranteed securities  farmer mac would have the right to enforce the underlying agricultural mortgage loans  and in the event of the default under the terms of those loans  would have access to the underlying collateral

other matters new accounting standards 
for all ltspcs or guarantees issued or modified on or after january   farmer mac recognizes  at inception of the guarantee or commitment  an asset that is equal to the fair value for the fees that will be received over the life of each guarantee or commitment and a liability for the fair value of its obligation to stand ready to perform 
both the asset and liability were subsequently measured and recorded at fair value 
in december of  the sec provided additional guidance on the day two accounting for these financial instruments 
in accordance with this guidance  farmer mac has adopted the amortized cost model for day two accounting 
this guidance will be applied prospectively for guarantees and commitments recorded at december  and all guarantees and commitments issued or modified on or after january  in december  the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop  addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
specifically  sop limits the yield that may be accreted and prohibits the carry over of a valuation allowance for all impaired loans that are within the scope of sop sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  on january   farmer mac adopted statement of financial accounting standards no
