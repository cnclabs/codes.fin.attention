critical accounting policies in the course of the company s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company

management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve for loan lease losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates can have on the company s results of operations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  and declines in local property values

consumer and other loans were million at december   up from million at december  the lease portfolio decreased by to million at december  from million at december  the lease portfolio has traditionally consisted of leases on vehicles for consumers and small businesses 
competition for automobile financing has led to a decline in the consumer lease portfolio over the past several years 
in addition  unfavorable laws in new york state have led the company to curtail its automobile leasing program 
in response to the decline in consumer leasing  management increased its marketing efforts relating to other leasing opportunities  including commercial leasing and municipal leasing  which have been the primary sources of growth in the lease portfolio

the reserve for loan lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses reserve on a regular basis 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve to be a critical accounting policy  given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the reserve required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumption could have on the results of operations 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve and the related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal and external loan review functions  the growth and composition of the loan lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonperforming loan statistics  the estimated values of collateral  and a historical review of loan lease loss experience 
based upon consideration of the above factors  management believes that the reserve is adequate to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the current loan lease portfolio 
management uses a model to measure some of these factors and the resulting quantitative analysis  combined with qualitative assessments  comprise the basis on which the adequacy of the reserve is determined 
the  decrease in the reserve between december  and december  resulted from net losses exceeding the provision for loan lease losses for the year 
the allocation of the company s reserve as of december   and each of the previous four year ends is illustrated in table table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses december dollar amounts in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year      allocation of the reserve by loan type commercial      real estate      consumer and all other      unallocated    total      allocation of the reserve as a percentage of total reserve commercial real estate consumer and all other unallocated total loan lease types as a percentage of total loans leases commercial real estate consumer and all other total management is committed to early recognition of loan problems and to maintaining an adequate reserve 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur  nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the reserve to each category does not restrict the use of the reserve to absorb losses in any category

management considers loans leases classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans leases 
the company  through its internal loan review function identified commercial relationships totaling million at december   and commercial relationships totaling million at december   which it classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
these factors  when considered in aggregate  give management reason to believe that the current risk exposure on these loans does not warrant classification of these loans as nonperforming 
approximately  of these loans are backed by guarantees of us government agencies 
while in a performing status as of december   these loans exhibit certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming 
accordingly  management s attention is focused on these credits  which are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
deposits and other liabilities total deposits of billion at december   reflected an increase of million over total deposits at december  deposit growth consisted primarily of core deposits  which increased by million  while municipal money market deposits decreased by million and time deposits of  or more decreased by million

liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through asset liability management committees of the subsidiary banks individually and on a combined basis 
these committees review periodic reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions 
comparisons with industry and peer groups are also monitored 
the company s strong reputation in the communities it serves  along with its strong financial condition  provide access to numerous sources of liquidity as described below 
management believes these diverse liquidity sources provide sufficient means to meet all demands on the company s liquidity that are reasonably likely to occur 
core deposits remain the key funding source  representing of total deposits  and of total liabilities at december  non core funding sources time deposits of  or more  brokered time deposits  municipal money market accounts  repurchase agreements  and other borrowings increased as a percentage of total liabilities from at december   to at december  short term investments  consisting of securities with maturities of one year or less  totaled million at year end and non core funding sources may require securities to be pledged against the underlying liability

at december   total unencumbered residential real estate assets were million 
additional assets may also qualify as collateral for fhlb advances upon approval of the fhlb 
cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
these assets may have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities  at fair value  increased from million at december   to million at december  using current prepayment assumptions  cash flow from the investment portfolio is estimated to be approximately million in investments in residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  and leases totaled approximately million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these loan assets provides significant additional cash flow to the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk the company s primary market risk exposure relates to sensitivity to interest rate changes 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the volatility in earnings resulting from changes in interest rates 
each quarter  or more frequently if necessary  the asset liability management committees estimate the earnings impact of changes in interest rates 
the findings of the committees are incorporated into investment and funding decisions  and in the business planning process 
table is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the analysis reflects a short term sensitivity to rising rates with some sensitivity to rising interest rates in the month repricing interval followed by longer term asset sensitivity in the month repricing intervals 
this analysis suggests that the company s net interest income is more vulnerable to a rising rate environment than it is to sustained low interest rates

the company s board of directors has set a policy that interest rate risk exposure will remain within a range whereby net interest income will not decline by more than in one year as a result of a basis point change in rates 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline from the base case scenario which assumes interest rates remain at current levels of approximately in net interest income  and management takes no action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would result in a decrease in net interest income of  when compared to the base case 
although the simulation model suggests relatively modest exposure to changes in interest rates  the base case scenario which assumes interest rates remain at current levels indicates a downward trending net interest margin due to more assets repricing in the current low rate environment than liabilities 
given the expectation of a lower net interest margin in  maintaining net interest income in at the amount realized in will depend upon continued growth in earnings assets 
the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  however  management feels that certain actions could be taken to offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates
