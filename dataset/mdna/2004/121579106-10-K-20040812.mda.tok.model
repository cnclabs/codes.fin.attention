the following discussion contains forward looking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed under the section entitled 
safe harbor statement 
overview burlington coat factory sales were weak during the first two quarters of fiscal as a result of the general economic condition 
however  sales strengthened in the second half of the year as the economy improved 
comparative store sales decreased by in fiscal as compared with the same twelve month period a year ago 
consolidated net sales for the fiscal year increased over the twelve month period a year ago 
while improving economic conditions contributed to the improved performance during the latter half of the year  the increase in consolidated net sales for the year resulted primarily from the sales contributed by the new stores that opened in fiscal the company s second quarter sales were weak as a result of the dramatically unseasonable warm weather throughout most of the country in october and november historically  sales in the months of september to january have accounted for of the company s net sales for the year 
the warm weather that was experienced throughout most of the areas served by the burlington coat factory directly resulted in lower than expected sales 
page of key performance measures management considers numerous factors in assessing the company s performance 
key performance measures used by management include comparative store sales  inventory turnover  inventory levels  gross margin  net margin and liquidity 
comparative store sales is a measure of the performance of a store during the current reporting period against the performance of the same store in the corresponding period of the previous year 
the company experienced a slight decrease in comparative store sales of in fiscal compared with fiscal in the company s case  the slight decline in comparative store sales was experienced even though unit sales increased 
the company experienced increased price competition from other retailers due to the availability of products from manufacturers at lower prices 
inventory turnover is a measure that indicates how efficiently inventory is bought and sold 
it measures the length of time the company owns its inventory 
this is significant because usually the longer the inventory is owned  the more likely markdowns may be required to sell the inventory 
inventory turnover is calculated by dividing the retail sales by the average stock for the period being measured 
inventory turnover improved slightly in fiscal with a rate  compared with a rate in fiscal inventory levels are monitored by management to assure that the stores are properly stocked to service customer needs while at the same time assuring that stores are not over stocked which would necessitate increased markdowns to move slow selling merchandise 
at the end of fiscal  the inventory was million versus million at the end of fiscal this increase in inventory is due to the increase in the number of stores operating in fiscal compared with fiscal the inventory per store was million in both fiscal and fiscal gross margin is a measure used by management to indicate whether the company is selling merchandise at an appropriate gross profit 
gross margin is the difference between net sales and the cost of goods 
the company experienced a slight increase in gross margin for fiscal to  from for fiscal net operating margin provides management with an indication of the operating profitability of the company 
net operating margin is the difference between revenues net sales and other income and the combination of the cost of goods and operating expenses selling and administrative expenses and depreciation 
the company s net margin increased slightly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal page of liquidity measures the company s ability to generate cash 
management measures liquidity through cash flow and working capital 
cash flow is the measure of cash generated from operating  financing  and investing activities 
the company experienced an increase in cash flow from operations resulting from an increase of cash from merchandise sales in fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year  and from an increase in trade accounts payable in fiscal compared with the prior year 
the increase in sales resulted from the contribution of sales from new stores and did not significantly improve the cash position of the company 
the increase in trade accounts payable was due to longer dating of accounts  which was driven by terms negotiated with vendors  and has benefited the company s cash position by allowing the company to hold and productively utilize the cash for a longer period 
in addition  the company sold million of senior notes in fiscal  which bolstered cash flow from financing activities 
the cash from the sale of notes increased the company s liquidity and further improved the current ratio 
the company will use the proceeds from the sale of notes for general corporate purposes and store expansions 
along with cash flow  working capital assists management in determining the company s ability to meet its cash requirements 
working capital measures the company s current financial position 
working capital is current assets minus current liabilities 
working capital for fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal this increase in working capital resulted in part from the company s sale of million of senior notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  asset impairment  retirement benefits  risk participation agreements  vendor promotional allowances  reserves for closed store and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following represent its more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  although the list is not exhaustive page of inventory 
the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventory at cost and resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  the use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventory 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  merchandise markon  markups  markdowns and shrinkage which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margin 
management believes that the company s retail i nventory method and application of fifo provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost using a first in  first out assumption and results in carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
estimates are used to charge inventory shrinkage for the first three fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 
an actual physical inventory is conducted at the end of the fiscal year to calculate actual shrinkage 
the company also estimates its required markdown allowances 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional markdowns may be required 
while the company makes estimates on the basis of the best information available to it at the time estimates are made  over accruals or under accruals may be uncovered as a result of the physical inventory requiring fourth quarter adjustments 
insurance 
the company has risk participation agreements with insurance carriers with respect to workers compensation and liability insurance 
pursuant to these arrangements  the company is responsible for paying individual claims up to designated dollar limits 
the amounts included in the company s costs related to these claims are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions or claims experience included in the associated insurance programs 
an increase in worker s compensation claims by employees or liability claims will result in a corresponding increase in the company s costs related to these claims 
reserves for revenue returns 
the company records reserves for future revenue returns 
the reserves are based on current revenue volume and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in the company s estimates may be required 
page of long lived assets 
the company tests for recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this includes performing an analysis of anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the company reduces the carrying value to its fair value  which is generally calculated using discounted cash flows 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the assets that may not be reflected in an asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the fut ure 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for bad checks and losses on credit card accounts
