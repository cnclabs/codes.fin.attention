item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a worldwide developer  producer  and marketer of chemical specialty products and a provider of chemical management services for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications around the globe  with significant sales to the steel and automotive industries 
our strategies and initiatives flow from three business imperatives sell customer solutions value not just fluids  operate as a globally integrated whole and harness the power of our global knowledge and learning 
success factors critical to the company s business include successfully differentiating ourselves from our competition  operating efficiently as a globally integrated whole  and increasing market share  customer penetration and profitability through internally developed programs and strategic acquisitions 
the company operates in mature businesses  which are driven by demand for consumer durables and are therefore subject to the vulnerabilities of a cyclical economy 
proved a difficult operating environment as it relates to demand 
the company experienced softness in sheet steel demand in the us and europe  two regions critical to our financial results 
the company s leading share position in those regions makes it a target for competition as our customers may see a need to establish second source suppliers 
also in  the company did see increased competitive activity in its european market resulting in a net loss of business and slight decrease in market share 
despite this difficult environment  the company s asian and south american regions saw strong growth 
as we enter  the competitive pressures and the challenges they present remain  but we still expect growth in our steel business primarily out of the asian and south american markets 
in  the company experienced significant revenue growth in its chemical management services cms with the award of new cms contracts in the north america automotive market 
the profitability of this new business is dependent on the company s ability to identify and implement cost reduction programs and to achieve product conversions 
during  the company expects to achieve increased profitability from this business as cost reductions and product conversions are achieved 
the company continually looks for acquisitions that are a tight fit in terms of products  strategic customers or complementary technology and therefore help to build market share or increase customer penetration 
in the past two years the company has made five such acquisitions adding approximately million of incremental revenues in although modest in size  these acquisitions have helped solidify the company s core business through increased product breadth and customer penetration and have and are expected to continue to contribute to revenues and earnings 
a significant amount of the revenue growth in can be attributed to cms  acquisitions  and foreign exchange 
cms and the acquisitions have different margin characteristics and did not contribute significantly to earnings 
in addition  the company in experienced significantly higher raw material costs and administrative expenses 
this resulted in only a small increase in earnings year over year 
as the company exited  the pricing in its key raw material markets  specifically crude oil based  animal fat and vegetable oil derivatives  were at four year highs 
the company does not believe this trend will reverse in the short term  and there is a risk of even higher raw material prices in  particularly  crude oil 
in addition  the company experienced increases in administrative costs in related to pension  insurance  its global enterprise resource planning system erp implementation and compliance with new governance regulations under the sarbanes oxley act 
the company again expects to see higher costs in for these items  in particular costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
despite these trends  the company grew both revenue and net income and remained committed to its long term strategic actions 
the company completed three tight fit acquisitions in and advanced customer penetration through major new cms contracts  all of which are expected to contribute to future growth 
the company continues to invest in its erp to further its initiative of operating as a globally integrated whole 
the company s balance sheet remains strong  and the company extended its dividend record to consecutive years of increases 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  accrued incentive compensation plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
through  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realization of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various domestic and foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital and expansion needs 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in  quaker recorded restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs is recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are no longer amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to its carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter and no impairment charge was warranted 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
for  the company incurred such a non cash charge to equity of million 
the company s pension plan year end is november  which serves as the measurement date 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of certain variable interest entities  vies  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no

 the company did not reflect the effects of this act in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require the company to change previously reported information 
the company is currently assessing the impact of the act 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily from million provided by operating activities and million provided by financing activities  offset in part by million used in investing activities 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this decrease primarily resulted from increased working capital needs associated with the company s recently awarded cms contracts  effective may  net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in dividends and distributions from associated companies increased million in  and were driven by priority distributions received from the company s real estate joint venture 
the company paid million for acquisitions versus million for acquisitions

the remaining capital expenditures related to upgrades of manufacturing capabilities at various locations  with million spent for environmental and regulatory compliance in both and for  the company expects capital expenditures to be approximately million as most of the lab renovation is complete and the company expects limited capital being spent towards our global erp implementation 
in january  the company contributed its conshohocken  pennsylvania property and buildings the site to a real estate joint venture the venture in exchange for a interest in the venture 
the venture did not assume any debt or other obligations of the company 
the venture renovated certain of the existing buildings at the site  as well as built new office space 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the venture to lease approximately of the site s available office space for a year period commencing february  with multiple renewal options 
during  the company received priority cash distributions  which reduced the company s investment balance to as of december   approximately of the site s office space was under lease and the site including improvements thereon was subject to encumbrances securing indebtedness of the venture in the amount of million 
the company has not guaranteed nor is it obligated to pay any principal  interest or penalties on the indebtedness of the venture  even in the event of default by the venture 
at december   the venture had property with a net book value of million  total assets of million  and total liabilities of million 
net cash flows provided by financing activities were million in versus a million use of cash in the increase in cash provided by financing activities was as a result of increased short term borrowings in order to fund current year acquisitions and working capital needs primarily associated with the company s new cms contracts 
the company increased its principal credit facilities from million committed and million uncommitted at the end of march to its current position of million committed and million uncommitted 
the company had approximately million and million outstanding on these credit facilities as of december  and  respectively 
the provisions of the agreements require that the company maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  and under its most restrictive covenants the company can borrow an additional million as of december  the company believes that it is capable of renewing its current credit facilities  on an annual basis  or obtaining additional borrowing capacity on competitive terms 
following are the details of the company s individual facilities 
in april  the company entered into a million committed credit facility  with a bank  with an expiration date of april in march  the company replaced its million committed credit facility with another facility with the same lender of million  which expires in december at the company s option  the interest rate for borrowings under the agreement may be based on the lender s cost of funds plus a margin  libor plus a margin  or on the prime rate

the company s acquisitions and the timing of the acquisitions increased net sales by million  or  and the company s recently awarded chemical management services cms contracts  which were effective may   increased net sales by approximately million or 
the remaining increase in net sales was due primarily to double digit growth in the asia pacific and south american regions partially offset by a decline in business in the us and europe 
the decline in business in the us and europe was substantially caused by softness in sheet steel demand 
in addition  in late  the company experienced some increased competition as a result of the company s strong market share coupled with its customers interest in establishing second source suppliers 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the company s new cms contracts result in a different relationship between margins and revenue than has applied in the past for the company s traditional product business 
at the majority of current cms sites  the company effectively acts as an agent and records revenue and costs from third party sales on a net sales or pass through basis 
the new cms contracts have a different structure that results in the company recognizing in reported revenue the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other since the company currently has very little of its own product converted at these sites 
the negative impact to gross margin related to the new cms contracts was approximately percentage points 
the remaining decline in gross margin as a percentage of sales is primarily due to increased raw material costs and product mix 
at the end of  the company experienced a four year high in the pricing in the market for its key raw material markets  specifically crude oil based  animal fat and vegetable oil derivatives 
the company estimates the raw material price increases negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million in selling  general and administrative costs sg a as reported for were million compared to million in approximately three quarters of the million increase is due to foreign exchange rate translation and the company s acquisition activity  which impacted sg a by approximately million and million  respectively 
the remaining increase in sg a was due to higher costs including pension  insurance  and the company s continued rollout of its global erp system  offset in part by reduced incentive compensation expense 
in  the company expects to again see higher expenses related to these administrative areas as well as increases related to sarbanes oxley act compliance and the restoration of performance based incentive compensation 
also included in the results is a million net restructuring charge 
severance program costs of approximately million were partially offset by the release of million of unused restructuring accruals related to the company s restructuring program 
the company s effective tax rate was in versus in the reduction in the effective tax rate is reflective of the company s favorable settlement of several outstanding tax audits and appeal issues 
the effective tax rate is dependent on many internal and external factors and is assessed by the company on a regular basis 
currently  the company anticipates its effective tax rate for will remain in the to range 
equity in net income of associated companies for was million higher than this increase primarily reflects a priority distribution received from the company s real estate joint venture as well as improved performance from this venture compared to the million increase in minority interest expense is primarily due to full year consolidation of the company s south african joint venture 
effective july   the company acquired a controlling interest of quaker chemical south africa pty 
ltd 
south africa 
comparison of with consolidated net sales increased to million in from million in the increase was the net result of a increase in volume and a improvement in price mix  offset by a negative impact from foreign currency translation 
the increase in volume was primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from the acquisitions of united lubricants corporation and epmar corporation  as well as the purchase of a controlling interest in the company s south african joint venture  which was included in the company s consolidated results effective july  at constant exchange rates and excluding revenue from acquisitions  consolidated net sales increased 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was in compared with in this increase in gross margin percentage was attributable to higher volumes and lower raw material prices with some product mix changes

 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
sg a for included million of goodwill amortization 
other significant costs in included million of additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily attributable to us steel customers that filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter and million of organizational structure costs 
the overall increase in sg a was primarily related to the company s acquisitions  which added approximately million of expense  as well as higher administrative costs such as insurance  pension  incentive compensation  and expenses related to the company s new global erp implementation

the restructuring charge of million related to plans to close and sell the company s manufacturing facilities in the uk and france  reduce administrative functions  as well as costs related to abandoned acquisitions 
the overall increased operating income in was primarily attributable to the significant costs noted above  as well as higher gross margin from the noted volume increases 
the company s effective tax rate was in versus in the effective tax rate is dependent on many internal and external factors and is assessed by the company on a regular basis 
the company had previously been assessed additional taxes based on an audit of certain subsidiaries for prior years  which had been resolved with no material impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
equity in net income of associated companies for was approximately million lower than this decrease was primarily attributable to the july purchase of a controlling interest in the company s south african joint venture  as well as losses from the start up of the company s real estate joint venture 
minority interest in net income of subsidiaries for was approximately million lower than this decrease was substantially the result of lower us dollar net income from the company s joint venture in brazil partially offset by an improved performance of the company s china joint venture and the purchase of a controlling interest in our south african joint venture

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
general the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets

factors that may affect our future results cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of certain information included in this report and other materials filed or to be filed by quaker with the sec as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us contain or may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations about future events 
these forward looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  anticipations  intentions  financial condition  results of operations  future performance and business  including statements relating to our business strategy  our current and future results and plans  and statements that include the words may  could  should  would  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan or similar expressions 
such statements include information relating to current and future business activities  operational matters  capital spending  and financing sources 
from time to time  oral or written forward looking statements are also included in quaker s periodic reports on forms q and k  press releases and other materials released to the public 
any or all of the forward looking statements in this report  in quaker s annual report to shareholders for and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
this can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed in this report will be important in determining our future performance 
consequently  actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in quaker s subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a major risk is that the company s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers products  which subjects the company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns 
other major risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september  furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those discussed below could also adversely affect us 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
this discussion is provided as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s long term debt has a fixed interest rate  while its short term debt is negotiated at market rates which can be either fixed or variable 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of short term debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s short term borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in short term borrowings 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of the consolidated net annual sales 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially adversely affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also tend to exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
through  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
