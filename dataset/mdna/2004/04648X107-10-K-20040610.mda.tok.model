item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture  sell and support integrated automation systems primarily for the semiconductor  and secondarily for the flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to enable semiconductor and fpd manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and yield and to protect their investment in fragile materials and work in process 
we sell our systems directly to semiconductor and fpd manufacturers  as well as to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that integrate our systems with their equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
in response to the industry downturn  we have reduced costs in several areas 
we reduced approximately percent of our headcount in april  due to ongoing weakness in our business  our outsourcing of manufacturing  and the sale of two discontinued operations and our wafer carrier business 
we also announced plans to outsource our japanese manufacturing operations 
in october  we began transitioning substantially all of our us manufacturing to solectron corporation  which we believe will reduce our fixed manufacturing costs and improve our ability to respond to sales fluctuations 
the transition was substantially completed in june over the past two years  we have reduced our workforce from a peak of approximately  employees to employees  not including employees of asyst shinko  as of march  we sell our products principally through a direct sales force worldwide 
our functional currency is the us dollar  except in japan where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
the costs and expenses of our international subsidiaries are recorded in local currency  and foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
on october   we established a joint venture with shinko called asyst shinko  inc  or asi 
the joint venture develops  manufactures and markets market leading amhs with principal operations in tokyo and ise  japan 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  we acquired percent of the joint venture for approximately million of cash and transaction costs 
shinko contributed its entire amhs business  including intellectual property and other assets  installed customer base and approximately employees 
we acquired asi to enhance our presence in the mm amhs and flat panel display markets 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
and  accordingly  the 
table of contents results of asi are included in the consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to its acquisition 
in april  asi acquired the portion of shinko technologies  inc that provides ongoing support to asi s north american amhs customers from shinko electric  co  ltd  shinko 
asi renamed this subsidiary asyst shinko america  or asam 
in may  asyst connectivity technologies  inc  or act  a wholly owned subsidiary of asyst  purchased substantially all of the assets of domainlogix corporation  or dlc  a delaware corporation 
in may  we acquired percent of the common stock of gw associates  inc  or gw  a california corporation 
in fiscal  we acquired a majority ownership percentage of mecs  a japanese engineering and robotics manufacturing company  and in fiscal our ownership percentage increased percent to percent 
mecs is now merged into aji  our wholly owned subsidiary 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and restructuring and impairment charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment 
revenue for these types of products is recognized at shipment 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
other products are highly customized systems that cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion 
because of the size  complexity and duration of the projects  significant judgment is required to estimate the total cost of the project 
when using the percentage of completion method  revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that require such revisions become known and losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
we utilize the 
table of contents percentage of completion method due to the significance of the service effort and the length of time of the contracts 
revenue for spare parts is recognized on shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities 
we account for software revenue recognition in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenues for integration software work are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when the software is shipped  payment is due within one year  collectibility is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts and a general reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the test identifies when impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting segments that contain goodwill  based primarily on expected future cash flows  reduce the amount by the fair value of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and then compare the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeds the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense is recognized 
in connection with the annual impairment analysis for goodwill  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
warranty accrual our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a pre determined amount of time  generally to months  for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
in fiscal  we outsourced all of our products manufactured in the united states to solectron corporation 
solectron assumes the warranty liability for the first months on products it manufacturers  with asyst liable for warranty obligations beyond months 
we record the estimated warranty cost upon shipment of our products 
the estimated warranty cost is determined based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if in the future we determine that 
table of contents we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  charging income in the period such determination was made 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived tangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  or sfas no 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets is based on the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
results of operations net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
the increase in fiscal sales was in amhs and mm smif products sold to semiconductor manufacturers 
excluding the impact of asi  net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or percent from the prior year 
this decrease was mainly due to the general decline in the semiconductor equipment sector and the sale of our wafer and reticle carrier product lines during fiscal these product lines generated million of revenue in fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million or percent from fiscal the increase in fiscal sales was primarily due to revenue associated with the acquisition of asi and increased sales to customers in china and taiwan 
gross profit because the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid fluctuations in demand  we have made significant reductions and changes in our manufacturing operations to decrease the fixed component of our manufacturing costs and improve our margins during downturns 
in fiscal  we had reductions of workforce  in both us and international operations 
in fiscal  we began transitioning all of our us manufacturing operations to solectron  a contract manufacturer  and completed this transition in fiscal our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal was primarily due to product mix change resulting from higher amhs revenue with lower gross margins 
in addition  asi recorded a million charge in fiscal for estimated losses that are anticipated on certain customer contracts and recorded a million provision relating to excess and obsolete inventory 
although our traditional business was helped by our continuing transition to outsourced manufacturing and a lower cost supply chain  the gross profit deteriorated from the prior year due to an increased mix of legacy portal and sorter products with lower gross margins 
the improvement in gross profit in fiscal from the prior year was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes  which better absorbed manufacturing overhead  facility and headcount reduction actions taken in fiscal  and higher mix of mm products 

table of contents research and development r d expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in r d spending in fiscal was mainly due to headcount reductions and other spending cuts in early fiscal in response to our sales declines 
our higher r d spending in fiscal resulted from our decision to continue strategic product development programs and the inclusion of r d spending in asi and act 
selling  general and administrative over the past three years we have reduced selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses to better align our spending with lower sales levels 
sg a expenses declined to million  or percent of net sales  compared with million  or percent of net sales in fiscal sg a expense was million for the fiscal year ended march   representing percent of net sales 
the decreases in fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from workforce reductions  facility closures  and reduced discretionary spending offset by increases due to acquisitions of asi and dlc 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expenses relating to acquired intangible assets were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  we amortize acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from three to ten years 
the increases in amortization expenses in fiscal and are primarily due to the acquisition of the asi joint venture interest 
restructuring and other charges restructuring and other charges for the fiscal years ended march   and were in thousands severance excess fixed asset and benefits facility impairment total balance  march  additional accruals non cash related adjustments amounts paid in cash balance  march  additional accruals non cash related adjustments amounts paid in cash balance  march  additional accruals non cash related adjustments amounts paid in cash balance  march  in fiscal  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily related to million in severance costs from a reduction in workforce in april and a million charge related to the settlement and release of claims arising from the termination of a former officer 
included were also 
table of contents million of severance expenses primarily from headcount reductions in our japanese operations 
in addition to the severance charges  we recorded million for exiting a facility in connection with our restructuring activities and for future lease obligations on a vacated facility in excess of estimated future sublease proceeds 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we terminated the employment of approximately employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development and in selling  general and administration  from our us operations as well as international operations 
we anticipate potential restructuring charges of million to million over the next several quarters as we continue our previously announced cost reduction initiatives 
in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to excess facilities that we had under lease but had abandoned as a result of our decision to outsource our manufacturing activities and an excess facility charge of million reflecting revised estimates of future sublease income based on continued weakness in the austin  texas commercial real estate market 
we also recorded severance charges of million resulting from headcount reductions and contractual obligations of million as a result of workforce reduction measures 
the restructuring activities affected approximately employees in manufacturing  sales  research and development and administrative staff  including approximately employees who joined solectron 
we also recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million for assets abandoned due to facility consolidation and the integration of certain programs into asi 
in fiscal  restructuring charges were recorded resulting from our plan to shut down some of our manufacturing and service locations  outsource some of our manufacturing activities and consolidate the remainder of our us manufacturing in fremont  california  as well as to reduce our workforce due to economic conditions 
these charges include approximately million in write downs of assets and reserves for lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income that we expect to generate from the vacated facilities  and severance costs of approximately million related to reductions in force of approximately employees  or percent of our workforce 
we expect to utilize the remaining accrual balance  primarily unused leased facilities  over the next two fiscal years 
all remaining accrual balances are expected to be settled in cash 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges for fiscal years  and were as follows fiscal years ended march  goodwill and intangible impairment land impairment totals we completed the sale of land in fremont  california  in the fiscal year ended march  the net proceeds from the sale were million 
we had intended to construct corporate headquarters facilities on the land and subsequently decided not to build these facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a million write down based on our latest estimate of market value as supported by the pending sale agreement at the time 
we previously entered into a purchase agreement in september to sell the land for million  net of selling expenses  which was expected to close in the quarter ended december  this transaction did not close 
as a result  a million write down was recorded in the second quarter in fiscal initially  we leased the land from a syndicate of financial institutions pursuant to an original lease agreement dated june   which was subsequently amended on february  and may  we purchased the land on october  for million  and we paid the syndicate of financial institutions approximately million for engineering costs incurred in preparation for making leasehold improvements to the land 
based upon market data at june  and our non cancelable commitment to purchase the land  we estimated that the then market value of the land had been impaired and recorded a million write down to its estimated market value in fiscal 
table of contents in fiscal  we completed an annual goodwill impairment test and determined that impairment charges of million were required because the estimated fair value of certain businesses were less than their book values 
the charges were measured by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which we believe approximates fair value  with their corresponding book values 
the charges relate to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our may acquisition of dlc 
we also performed a goodwill impairment test in fiscal and determined that impairment charges of million were required because the estimated fair value of certain businesses were less than their book values 
the charges were measured by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows  which we believed approximates fair value  with their corresponding book values 
the charges related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with previously acquired businesses 
in process research and development costs of acquired businesses and product lines in october  we acquired percent of the common stock of asi  our japanese amhs joint venture company 
in connection with the purchase price allocation  in the quarter ended december   we assigned million to in process research and development  or ipr d 
in june  we acquired dlc 
in connection with the purchase price allocation million was assigned to ipr d 
we identified research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed 
the value was determined by estimating the expected cash flows from the products once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
gain on sale of wafer and reticle carrier product line in fiscal  we sold our wafer and reticle carrier wrc products to entegris for net proceeds of million 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a gain on sale of million 
the wafer and reticle carrier products contributed revenues of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
other expense  net excluding gain on sale of wafer and recticle carrier product line other expense  net was million for the fiscal year ended march   million excluding gain on sale of wrc for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  the other expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were relatively flat from the prior year 
the increased expense in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily attributable to financing costs and fees related to funding the asi joint venture transaction  increased interest expense related to the million credit facility which was established and drawn down to partially fund the transaction  lower interest bearing cash balances  and lower interest rates on invested cash 
provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our loss before income taxes 
the benefit is primarily due to amortization of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the asi acquisition of million  offset by tax provisions in our international subsidiaries 
as a result of the review undertaken at september   we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
we therefore recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal benefit from income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended march  this represented an effective tax rate of percent for the fiscal year ended march  and percent for the fiscal year ended march  and percent for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents minority interest minority interest in the loss from continuing operations was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
no minority interest was recorded in fiscal this amount represents the percent of our joint venture partner  shinko  in the operations of asi 
discontinued operations  net of income tax there were no discontinued operations in fiscal loss from discontinued operations was million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  the loss in fiscal included goodwill and impairment charges of million 
in august  we announced our intention to divest two subsidiaries  amp and semifab  in order to allow us to better focus on our core business 
both subsidiaries were divested in march related party transactions at march   we held notes from two current non officer employees totaling million 
at march   we held notes from two former employees and two current employees totaling million 
one of the notes receivable is secured by a deed of trust on certain real property 
the fair market value of the property exceeds the loan amount 
these notes receivable are included in other assets at march  and march   respectively 
our majority owned subsidiary  asi  has certain transactions with the minority shareholder  shinko 
at march   significant balances owed to shinko were in thousands accounts payable due to shinko accrued liabilities due to shinko in addition  the consolidated condensed financial statements reflect that asi purchased various administrative and it services from shinko 
during the year ended march   sales to and purchases from shinko were in thousands sales material purchases services purchased guarantees commitments we have guaranteed certain lease payments with respect to equipment and real estate of our japanese subsidiary as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are contingently liable as part of the asi acquisition to provide funding for plan benefits under a pension plan of asyst shinko 
as part of the acquisition of asi in october  we recorded million of pension related obligations 
as of march   the remaining liability was million 
under certain remote circumstances  including bankruptcy and inability to pay by shinko  we may have to assume approximately up to million of shinko s pension obligations 
no recognition of this amount has been recorded to date as it is considered remote

eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities and public stock offerings  customer pre payments  bank borrowings and cash generated from operations 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in restricted cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and million in long term debt and capital lease obligations 
cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  and increases in receivables and inventory totaling million primarily due to significantly higher revenue 
these uses of cash were partially offset by non cash charges to net income including depreciation and amortization of million  asset impairment charges of million  deferred taxes of million  and inventory reserve adjustments of million 
additionally accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue increased by a combined million  primarily due to increased purchasing activities from higher revenue 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million 
the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges of million related to the deferred tax asset and million of restructuring  goodwill and intangibles impairment and asset write downs  million of depreciation and amortization  million of in process r d  and other items 
other significant sources of cash included increases in accounts payable accrued liabilities and deferred revenue by a combined million  and an inventory decrease of million primarily due to the sale of inventory to solectron related to our outsourcing of manufacturing 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was million 
we received net proceeds of million from the sale of land and purchased short term investments of million  net 
this source of cash was offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million and cash used in connection with our acquisition of asam of million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million 
we used million of net cash in the acquisitions of the asi jv interest and dlc  and received million from the sale of our wafer and reticle product lines wrc 
in addition  we sold short term investments of million  net  and used million for purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  primarily from a total of million from issuance of common stock through our secondary stock offering and under our employee stock programs 
proceeds from this issuance were used in the repayment of million against our commercial banking line of credit 
we also received proceeds from the sale of receivables in the amount of million 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock  including exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at an offering price to the public of per share 
we received total proceeds of million  net of the related issuance fees and costs 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million 
during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from our line of credit and million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock programs 
these sources of cash were offset by net principal payments on short term and long term debt and capital leases of million 
in october  we entered into a million two year revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank 
the specific amount of the credit line available  however  may change based on the amount of receivables held 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate indexed to libor 
the credit line was fully paid down during the quarter ended december  during fiscal year  we amended the financial covenants 
as amended  we were required under the agreement to maintain compliance with financial covenants  including a quarterly net income loss target  calculated on an after tax basis excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items and a requirement that we maintain with the bank during 
table of contents the term of the credit agreement a minimum balance of million of cash and cash equivalents 
as of the quarter ended december   we were not in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
however  we obtained a waiver of compliance from the bank for these certain covenants 
we entered into an agreement with the bank  effective as of may   to amend and restate the terms of our existing credit agreement which extended its term through may   changed and expanded the base of assets under which we qualify for borrowings under the credit facility and reduced certain fees and interest charges applicable to borrowings under the credit line 
the credit agreement also restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock  redeem capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make payments on our subordinated debt  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
as of march   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
we cannot assure that we will meet the quarterly net income loss covenant or other covenants in subsequent quarters 
non compliance with the financial covenants in the future may preclude our ability to borrow under the credit agreement or require us to repay any borrowings outstanding 
these covenants may otherwise adversely affect our company if our company fails to comply with them 
on july   we completed the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes which provided us with aggregate proceeds of million net of issuance costs 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature july   pay interest on january and july of each year and are redeemable at our option after july  we had million and million at march  and  respectively  of short term debt from banks in japan 
as of march   the interest rate ranged from percent to percent interest rates ranged from percent to percent at march  
we had secured straight bonds from a bank in japan of million at march  the bonds bore interest at rates ranging from percent to percent as of march  and mature in fiscal year certain of our assets in japan have been pledged as security for these secured straight bonds as well as for short term debt 
as of march   pledged assets consist of land and other property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  time deposits and accounts receivable totaling million 
additionally asyst us has provided letters of guarantee to financial institutions in japan covering substantially all of aji s debts 
in september  asi entered into a short term bank facility with a japanese bank under which it may borrow up to approximately million at the exchange rate as of march  the current interest rate is percent 
this facility primarily supports asi s working capital requirements during the construction of its amhs projects  particularly located in japan where customers generally pay four to six months after acceptance of a completed project 
asi had outstanding borrowings of million under this facility that is recorded in short term debt at march  under terms of the bank facility  asi must generate annual operating profits on a statutory basis 
we were in compliance with the loan covenants at march  we have an agreement with a japanese banking institution to sell certain of our trade receivables without recourse 
during fiscal  approximately million of receivables were sold under this agreement 
the total amount available under the facility is million at march  we lease facilities under non cancelable capital and operating leases  with expiration dates up to november we anticipate that operating expenses will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to finance additional working capital requirements such as accounts receivable 
however  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or the sale of assets 
these financings may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all or  if available  on terms acceptable to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing or other risks that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations the following table in thousands summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term loans and notes payable operating lease obligations long term debt and capital lease obligations total purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements about our future plans  objectives  intentions and expectations 
many factors  including those described below  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
risk related to our business if we fail to effectively manage our asi joint venture  our sales of automated material handling systems could be adversely affected and the mix of sales between amhs and our other products could affect our overall financial performance 
sales of automated material handling systems  or amhs  accounted for approximately percent of our sales for the fiscal year ended march   and are expected to be an important component of our future revenues 
substantially all of our amhs sales are through our majority owned joint venture subsidiary  asyst shinko  inc  or asi  of which we acquired percent in the third quarter of fiscal year while we have effective operating control of asi  certain major decisions require the approval of our joint venture partner  shinko electric co  ltd  or shinko  and the future success of asi depends in part on the strength of our relationship with shinko 
other than a right of first refusal if shinko is considering selling its stake in asi  we have no mechanism to acquire the percent of asi that is currently owned by shinko 
even if shinko were to offer to sell its stake in asi to us  we may not have sufficient funds available to facilitate such 
table of contents acquisition 
in addition  we have limited experience managing operations in japan  and our failure to manage effectively asi in japan could harm our business 
orders for amhs are relatively large  often exceeding million for a given project 
because of the size of these orders  our revenues are often concentrated among a small number of customers in any fiscal period 
additionally  the manufacture and installation of these systems at our customers manufacturing facilities can take up to six months 
we recognize revenue and costs for amhs based on percentage of completion because the contracts are long term in nature 
payments under these contracts often occur well after we incur our manufacturing costs 
for example  terms for our japanese amhs customers require payment to be made six months after customer acceptance of the installation 
the consequence of the amhs payment cycle is that significant demands can be placed on our working capital 
further  gross margins on our amhs sales are lower than those for our other products 
if we fail to effectively estimate costs and manage these long term projects  we could have loss contract exposure and additional gross margin pressure 
our overall financial performance will therefore be impacted by the mix of sales between amhs and other products in a given period 
if we are unable to increase our sales of amhs to fpd manufacturers  or if the fpd industry enters a cyclical downturn  our growth prospects could be negatively impacted 
in recent quarters  asi has begun to sell amhs to flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturers 
while we believe that sales to the fpd industry present a significant opportunity for growth  the size of this market opportunity depends in large part on capital expenditures by fpd manufacturers 
the market for fpd products is highly cyclical and has experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for manufacturing and automation equipment 
if the fpd market enters into a cyclical downturn  demand for amhs by the fpd market may be significantly reduced  impacting our growth prospects 
as a relatively new entrant to the fpd equipment market  we do not have the customer relationships that our competitors have 
similarly  our relative inexperience in the fpd industry may cause us to misjudge important trends and dynamics in this market 
if we are unable to anticipate future customer needs in the fpd market  our growth prospects may be severely reduced 
the timing of the industry s transition to mm technology is uncertain and competition may be intense  and could adversely affect our revenues 
the mm market is still relatively new 
we have invested  and are continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the timing of the industry s transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is uncertain  partly as a result of the recent period of reduced wafer fabrication capacity utilization 
delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology could adversely affect our potential revenue 
manufacturers who are implementing factory automation in mm fabs may seek to purchase systems from multiple vendors 
competition  including price competition  for these mm orders is intense 
we face increased competition for our mm products from a number of new entrants because of the development of semiconductor equipment and materials international  or semi  standards for mm products 
our gross margins on mm products may be lower than on mm products  which could adversely affect our ability to become and remain profitable 
the gross margins on our mm products currently are not as favorable as on our mm products 
this is primarily because our mm products are early in their production life  we face increased competition in this production line  and we sell a greater percentage of our mm products to oems rather than directly to semiconductor manufacturers 
manufacturing costs are generally higher in the early stages of new product introduction and typically decrease as demand increases  due to better economies of scale and efficiencies developed in the manufacturing processes 
however  we cannot assure you that we will see such economies of scale and efficiencies in our future manufacturing of mm products  which will be supplied primarily by 
table of contents contract manufacturers 
semi standards for mm products have enabled more suppliers to enter our markets  thereby increasing competition and creating pricing pressure 
while semiconductor manufacturers purchased a majority of mm tool automation products  oems are purchasing most of the tool automation products for mm 
sales to oems typically have lower gross margins 
these factors may prevent us from achieving or maintaining similar relative pricing and gross margin performance on mm products as we have achieved on mm products  and could adversely affect our ability to become and remain profitable 
most of our manufacturing is outsourced and we rely on a single contract manufacturer for much of our product manufacturing  which could disrupt the availability of our products or adversely affect our gross margins 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of most of our products 
solectron currently manufactures  under a long term contract  our products  other than amhs and our japanese robotics products 
asi also has outsourced a large portion of its amhs manufacturing to third parties 
in the future we may increase our dependence on contract manufacturers 
outsourcing may not yield the benefits we expect  and instead could result in increased product costs and product delivery delays 
outsourced manufacturing could create disruptions in the availability of our products if the timeliness or quality of products delivered does not meet our requirements or our customers expectations 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in receiving products from solectron 
problems with quality or timeliness could be caused by a number of factors including  but not limited to manufacturing process flow issues  financial viability of an outsourced vendor  availability of raw materials or components to the outsourced vendor  improper product specifications  and the learning curve to commence manufacturing at a new outsourced site 
our contract with solectron contains minimum purchase commitments which  if not met  could result in increased costs  which would adversely affect our gross margins 
we must also provide solectron with forecasts and targets based on actual and anticipated demand  which we may not be able to do effectively or efficiently 
if solectron purchases inventory based on our forecasts  and that inventory is not used  we must repurchase the unused inventory  which would adversely affect both our cash flows and gross margins 
if product supply is adversely affected because of problems in outsourcing we may lose sales and profits 
our outsourcing agreement with solectron includes commitments from solectron to adjust  up and down  manufacturing volume based on updates to our forecast demand 
however  solectron may be unable to meet these commitments and  even if it can  may be unable to react efficiently to rapid fluctuations in demand 
if our agreement with solectron terminates or if solectron does not perform its obligations under our agreement  it could take several months to establish alternative manufacturing for these products and we may not be able to fulfill our customers orders for most of our products in a timely manner 
if our agreement with solectron terminates  we may be unable to find another suitable outsource manufacturer 
any delays in meeting customer demand or quality problems resulting from product manufactured at an outsourced location could result in lost or reduced future sales to key customers and could have a material negative impact on our net sales  gross profits and results of operations 
shortages of components necessary for product assembly by solectron or us can delay shipments to our customers and can lead to increased costs  which may negatively impact our financial results 
when demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is strong  suppliers  both us and international  strain to provide components on a timely basis 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of many of our products  and disruption or termination of supply sources to our contract manufacturers or us could have a serious adverse effect on our operations 
many of the components and subassemblies used in our products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers  or in some cases may come from a single supplier 
a prolonged inability to obtain some components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could result in damage to our customer relationships 
shortages of components may also result in price increases for components and  as a result  could decrease our margins and negatively impact our financial results 

table of contents we have significant existing debts  the restrictive covenants under some of our debt agreements may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy  if we are forced to prepay some or all of this indebtedness our financial position would be severely and adversely affected 
we have a significant amount of outstanding indebtedness 
at march   our long term debt was million  and our short term debt was million  for an aggregate of million 
we have million of percent convertible subordinated notes outstanding which are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
we are required to pay interest on these convertible notes on january and july of each year 
these convertible notes mature july   and are redeemable at our option after july  our joint venture with shinko  asi  entered into a short term facility with a japanese bank under which it may borrow up to approximately million  of which million is currently outstanding 
we have also guaranteed the loans of our japanese subsidiary  asyst japan  inc  or aji  which loans currently total approximately million as of march  our two year revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  including a quarterly net income loss target  calculated on an after tax basis excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items and a requirement that we maintain with the bank during the term of the credit agreement a minimum balance of million of cash and cash equivalents 
the specific amount of the credit line available at any time  however  may change based on the amount of current receivables we have outstanding 
the covenants contained in our credit agreement with the bank also restrict our ability to take certain actions  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock  redeem capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates  create liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make payments on our debt  other than in the ordinary course  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
the credit line has been fully paid down since the quarter ended december  as of the quarter ended december   we were not in compliance with certain of these financial covenants 
however  we obtained a waiver of compliance from the bank for these certain covenants 
as of the quarter ended march   we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
we entered into an agreement with the bank  effective as of may   to amend and restate the terms of our existing credit agreement which extended its term through may   changed and expanded the base of assets under which we qualify for borrowings under the credit facility and reduced certain fees and interest charges applicable to borrowings under the credit line 
while we have substantial improvements in our financial results in the quarter ended march   we cannot assure you that we will meet the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement with comerica in subsequent quarters 
specifically  we may be unable to meet the maximum loss covenant or the minimum liquidity covenant in future quarters 
if we are unable to meet any covenants  we cannot assure you that the bank will grant waivers and amend the covenants  and comerica may terminate the agreement  preclude further borrowings and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings 
under terms of the asi bank facility  asi must generate operating profits on a statutory basis 
additionally  upon an event of default  the japanese banks may call the loans outstanding at aji  requiring repayment  which we have guaranteed 

table of contents as long as our indebtedness remains outstanding  the restrictive covenants could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
forced prepayment of some or all of our indebtedness would reduce our available cash balances and have an adverse impact on our operating and financial performance 
we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs  if we do need to secure financing  it may be on unfavorable terms 
we recently raised capital by issuing million shares of our common stock in a public offering in november  however  our operations are currently consuming cash and are expected to continue to do so for the next few quarters 
as a consequence  in the future we may be required to seek additional financing to meet our working capital needs and to finance capital expenditures  as well as to fund operations 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations 
this strain on our capital resources could adversely affect our business 
if our fully integrated tool front end solutions are not widely accepted  our growth prospects could be negatively impacted 
the decision by oems to adopt our tool front end  or portal  solutions for a large product line involves significant organizational  technological and financial commitments by the oems 
oems expect the portal solutions to meet stringent design  reliability and delivery specifications 
if we fail to satisfy these expectations  whether based on limited or expanded sales levels  oems will not adopt our portal solutions 
we cannot ensure that these tools will be widely accepted in the marketplace or that additional oems will adopt them 
we have invested significant time and expense in the development of spartan  our next generation portal offering specifically designed for the mm market 
while we believe spartan may improve our competitive position and gross margins in the mm industry  if the market acceptance of spartan is less than we have forecast or if the timing of this acceptance is delayed  our financial performance could be impacted 
further  because spartan is early in its production life  its manufacturing costs may be higher and resulting margins may be lower in the early stage of new product introduction 
notwithstanding our solutions  oems may purchase components to assemble or invest in the development of their own comparable portals 
if our solutions are not adopted by oems  our prospects will be negatively impacted and we may not be able to achieve profitability 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet their needs on a timely basis 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers  and our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time  without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
customer orders are often received with extremely short lead times 
if we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner  we could lose sales and customers 

table of contents we depend on large purchases from a few significant customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
the markets in which we sell our products comprise a relatively small number of oems and semiconductor manufacturers 
large orders from a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and make our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
the sales cycles to new customers range from six to months from initial inquiry to placement of an order  depending on the complexity of the project 
these extended sales cycles make the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
a significant portion of the net sales in any quarter is typically derived from a small number of long term  multi million dollar customer projects involving upgrades of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities 
generally  our customers may cancel or reschedule shipments with limited or no penalty 
our customers demand for our products is largely driven by the timing of new fab construction and the upgrading of existing fabs initiated by those customers 
as such  when we complete projects for a customer  business from that customer will decline substantially unless it undertakes additional projects incorporating our products 
the high cost of building a fab is causing increasing numbers of semiconductor manufacturers to outsource the manufacturing of their semiconductors to foundries 
this trend toward foundry outsourcing  combined with increasing consolidation within the semiconductor industry  could continue to decrease the number of our potential customers and increase our dependency on our remaining customers 
we may not be able to retain our largest customers or attract additional customers  and our oem customers may not be successful in selling the oem equipment in which our systems are embedded 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers 
in addition  our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us and may continue to do so in the future  particularly during downturns in the semiconductor market 
further  our current and prospective customers have exerted pressure on us to shorten delivery times and to customize and improve the capabilities of our products  thus increasing our manufacturing costs 
in addition  some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors 
failure to respond adequately to such pressures could result in a loss of customers or orders and the inability to develop successful relationships with new customers  which would have a negative impact on our business 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
in addition  since each customer represents a significant percentage of net sales  the timing of the completion of an order can lead to a fluctuation in our quarterly results 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
the development of more complex semiconductors has driven the need for new facilities  equipment and processes to produce these devices at an acceptable cost 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we often require long lead times for development of our products  which requires us to expend significant management effort and to incur material development costs and other expenses 
during development periods we may not realize corresponding revenue in the same period  or at all 
we may not succeed with our product development efforts and we may not respond effectively to technological change  which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may become involved in litigation concerning the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret and copyright protection to establish and protect our intellectual property 
while we intend to take reasonable steps to protect our patent rights  we cannot assure you that our patents and other intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or avoided  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on trade secrets 
table of contents that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  or our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or independently developed by  others 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical  could detract from the value of our product  or could delay our ability to meet customer demands or opportunities 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how  to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others  or to determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of our management  which by itself could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in any litigation could result in our loss of intellectual property rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these effects could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the intellectual property laws in asia do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
it may be necessary for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our  or our competitors  intellectual property rights in asia  which could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
if we are unable to defend our intellectual property rights in asia  our future business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to integrate efficiently the operations of our acquisitions  and may incur substantial losses in the divestiture of assets or operations 
we have made and may continue to make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  technologies or market access 
if we are to realize the anticipated benefits of past and future acquisitions  the operations of these companies must be integrated and combined efficiently with our own 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of operations  while managing a larger entity  has in the past presented and will continue to present a significant challenge to our management 
in addition  it is not certain that we will be able to incorporate different technologies into our integrated solution 
the difficulties of integration may increase because of the necessity of combining personnel with varied business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
we may incur substantial costs associated with these activities and we may suffer other material adverse effects from these integration efforts which could materially reduce our short term earnings 
we may not succeed with the integration process and we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the business combinations  or we could decide to divest or discontinue existing or recently acquired assets or operations 
for example  in fiscal  we decided to discontinue operations of our semifab and amp subsidiaries  both of which we had acquired in february  as these subsidiaries were generating significant operating losses and not considered critical to our long term strategy 
these subsidiaries were sold at the end of fiscal at a substantial loss 
the dedication of management resources to such integration or divestitures may detract attention from the day to day business  and we may need to hire additional management personnel to mange our acquisitions or divestitures successfully 

table of contents as our quarterly and yearly operating results are subject to variability  comparisons between periods may not be meaningful  this variability in our results could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenues and operating results can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year  depending on factors such as general trends in the overall economy  electronics industry and semiconductor manufacturing industry  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  changes in customer buying patterns  the degree of competition we face  the size  timing and product mix of customer orders  lost sales due to any failure in the outsourcing of our manufacturing  the availability of key components  the timing of product shipment and acceptance  which are factors in determining when we recognize revenue  and the timely introduction and acceptance of new products 
these and other factors increase the risk of unplanned fluctuations in our net sales 
a shortfall in net sales in a quarter or a fiscal year as a result of these factors could negatively impact our operating results for that period 
given these factors  we expect quarter to quarter and year to year performance to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
as a result  period to period comparisons of our performance may not be meaningful  and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
in one or more future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may cause our stock price to decline 
we face significant economic and regulatory risks because a majority of our net sales are from outside the united states 
a significant portion of our net sales is attributable to sales outside the united states  primarily in taiwan  japan  china  korea  singapore and europe 
international sales were percent of our total net sales for fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
this concentration increases our exposure to any risks in this area 
sales to customers outside the united states are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of governmental controls  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  terrorism and anti american sentiment  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer product acceptance and payment cycles  and the greater difficulty of administering business overseas 

table of contents any kind of economic instability in parts of asia where we do business can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian regions  including taiwan and japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from customers 
the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
although we invoice a majority of our international sales in united states dollars  for sales in japan  we invoice our sales in japanese yen 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the japanese yen may adversely affect our future results of operations 
we do not currently engage in active currency hedging transactions 
nonetheless  as we expand our international operations  we may allow payment in additional foreign currencies and our exposure to losses in foreign currency transactions may increase 
moreover  the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
for example  if the united states dollar declined in value relative to a local currency  we could be required to pay more for our expenditures in that market  including salaries  commissions  local operations and marketing expenses  each of which is paid in local currency 
in addition  we may lose customers if exchange rate fluctuations  currency devaluations or economic crises increase the local currency price of our products or reduce our customers ability to purchase our products 
asian and european courts might not enforce judgments rendered in the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability in asia and europe of judgments obtained in any federal or state court in the united states in civil and commercial matters 
the united states does not currently have a treaty with many asian and european countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of a fixed debt or sum of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states would not automatically be enforceable in many european and asian countries 
our current and planned operations may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 
we may expand our operations through both internal growth and acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls 
in addition  we may incur higher operating costs and be required to expend substantial working capital to fund operations during such an expansion 
in addition  during an expansion  we may incur significantly increased up front costs of sale and product manufacture well in advance of receiving revenue for such product sales 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls 
if we fail to do so  our growth will be limited and our liquidity and ability to fund our operations could be significantly strained 
our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses 
further  consideration for future acquisitions could be in the form of cash  common stock  rights to purchase stock  or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing shareholders  and to earnings per share  may result if shares of common stock or other rights to purchase common stock are issued in connection with any future acquisitions 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train or retain qualified personnel  our business would be harmed 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our key management and other key personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
in particular  the services of dr 
stephen schwartz  chairman of our board of directors  chief executive officer and president  who has led our company since august and chairman since january  are very important to our business 
none of our senior management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our key personnel 
the loss of any of our senior management or key personnel could harm our business 

table of contents our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  legal and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
competition for qualified senior employees can be intense 
if we fail to do this  business would be harmed 
moreover  some of the individuals on our management team have been in their current positions for a relatively short period of time 
for example  our chief financial officer joined us in october and our senior vice president of worldwide manufacturing operations joined us in may our future success will depend to a significant extent on the ability of our management team to work effectively together 
there can be no assurance that our management team will be able to integrate and work together effectively 
if we account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it could significantly impact our results from operations 
there has been ongoing public debate whether stock options granted to employees should be treated as a compensation expense and  if so  how to properly value such charges 
on march   the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued an exposure draft  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which would require a company to recognize  as an expense  the fair value of stock options and other stock based compensation to employees beginning in and subsequent reporting periods 
if we elect or are required to record an expense for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as described in the exposure draft  we could have significant and ongoing accounting charges  which could adversely impact our results from operations 
risks related to our industry the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by recurring downturns in the semiconductor industry  and these cycles can harm our operating results 
our business is largely dependent upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers 
semiconductor manufacturers are dependent on the then current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these periodic downturns  whether the result of general economic changes or decreases in demand for semiconductors  are difficult to predict and often have a severe adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
sales of equipment to semiconductor manufacturers may be significantly more cyclical than sales of semiconductors  as the large capital expenditures required for building new fabs or facilitizing existing fabs is often delayed until semiconductor manufacturers are confident about increases in future demand 
if demand for semiconductor equipment remains depressed for an extended period  it will seriously harm our business 
our industry began experiencing a significant downturn in due to decreased worldwide demand for semiconductors 
during this downturn  most of our customers reduced capital expenditures  which adversely impacted our business 
excluding sales of asi  which was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal  our net sales declined sequentially in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal and again in the first quarter of fiscal although our net sales increased million in the fourth quarter ended march   or percent sequentially  and increased million in our third quarter ended december   or percent  from the prior quarter  we cannot assure you that our sales will recover sufficiently for us to return to profitability in the near future 
as a result of substantial cost reductions in response to the decrease in net sales and uncertainty over the timing and extent of any industry recovery  we may be unable to make the investments in marketing  research and development and engineering that are necessary to maintain our competitive position  which could seriously harm our long term business prospects 
we believe that the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries will continue  leading to periodic industry downturns  which may seriously harm our business and financial position 

table of contents we may not effectively compete in a highly competitive semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we currently face direct competition with respect to all of our products 
a number of competitors may have greater name recognition  more extensive engineering  research development  manufacturing  and marketing capabilities  and substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than those available to us 
brooks automation  inc  or brooks  and tdk corporation of japan are our primary competitors in the area of isolation systems 
our smart traveler system products face competition from bar code technology as well as from brooks  and a number of smaller competitors 
we also compete with several companies in the robotics area  including  but not limited to  brooks  newport corp  rorze corporation and yasukawa super mectronics division 
in the area of amhs  our products face competition from daifuku co  ltd  murata co  ltd  and brooks 
in our fpd business  we compete with daifuku and murata 
our wafer sorters compete primarily with products from recif  inc and brooks 
in addition  the industry transition to mm wafers is likely to draw new competitors to the facility automation market 
in the mm wafer market  we expect to face intense competition from a number of established automation companies such as brooks  as well as new competition from semiconductor equipment and cleanroom construction companies 
we expect that our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with our systems  improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics 
in order to remain competitive  we need to continue to improve and expand our product line  which will require us to maintain a high level of investment in research and development 
ultimately  we may not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive 
companies in the semiconductor capital equipment industry face continued pressure to reduce costs 
pricing actions by our competitors may require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by periodically positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected by rising interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   the fair market value of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount
