the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
the significant accounting principles that management believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding the company s financial results are included below 
see notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these and other accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product and transfer of ownership to the customer 
the impact of judgments and estimates on revenue recognition is minimal 
a reserve for estimated returns is established at the time of sale based on historical return experience to cover returns of defective product and is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is recorded generally based on a percentage of aged receivables and management s evaluation of customer credit risk 
management judgment is utilized in assessing customer creditworthiness  changes in customer payment history  historical bad debt experience and economic and market trends 
different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in changes to these reserves 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
the company has net deferred tax assets of million at june  in assessing the need for valuation allowances  the company considers future forecasted taxable income and tax planning strategies 
the company has determined that it is unlikely that it will realize a net deferred asset in the future relating to certain non us net operating losses 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded in fiscal to offset the recording of a deferred tax asset of million related to certain european net operating losses 
the cumulative valuation allowance relating to net operating losses is approximately million at june  the company has operations in several countries around the world that are subject to income and other similar taxes in these countries 
the estimation of the income tax amounts to be recorded by the company involves the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations  evaluation of tax audit findings and assessment of how the foreign taxes may affect domestic taxes 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax matters 
allowance for inventory inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market value 
fifo inventories recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet are adjusted for an allowance covering inventories determined to be slow moving or excess 
the allowance for slow moving and excess inventories is maintained at an amount management considers appropriate based on factors such as historical usage of the product  open sales orders and future sales forecasts 
such factors require judgment  and changes in any of these factors could result in changes to this allowance 
pension plans the company s pension obligations are measured as of march for the us plan and as of june for the international plans 
international plans are primarily in japan  ireland  taiwan and korea 
the weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the projected benefit obligation pbo as of june and pension expense for the years ended june are as follows us plan int l plans us plan int l plans us plan int l plans pbo as of june discount rate rate of compensation increase pension expense for the years ended june discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments 
the company has typically used the corporate aa aa bond rate for this assumption 
the expected return on plan assets noted above represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected on the pension assets 
the company has estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans 
the effects of the indicated increase and decrease in selected assumptions  assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses  for the company s pension plans as of june   is shown below in thousands increase decrease increase decrease in pbo in pension expense us plan int l plans us plan int l plans discount rate change increase point   decrease point   expected rate of return change increase point n a n a decrease point n a n a the company s overall investment strategy for the assets in the pension funds is to achieve a balance between the goals of growing plan assets and keeping risks at a reasonable level over a long term investment horizon 
in order to reduce unnecessary risk  the pension funds are diversified across several asset classes with a focus on total return 
the weighted average asset allocations for the company s pension plans at june are as follows us plan int l plans us plan int l plans asset allocation equity bonds real estate and other n a n a the expected benefit payments from the company s pension plans are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million in to the company expects to contribute million in fiscal to its pension plans 
other postretirement benefits the company has retiree health care plans that cover the majority of its us employees 
there are no significant postretirement health care benefit plans outside of the us the company measures its retiree health care benefit obligations as of march the weighted average assumptions used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo as of june and benefit expense for the years ended june are as follows apbo as of june discount rate health care cost trend rate ultimate health care cost trend rate years to ultimate rate benefit expense for the years ended june discount rate health care cost trend rate ultimate health care cost trend rate years to ultimate rate the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amount of the apbo and retiree health care benefit expense 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in thousands effect on total service and interest cost increase point decrease point effect on apbo increase point    decrease point    goodwill and intangible assets the company reviews at least annually the realizability of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company uses a discounted cash flow model for the evaluation of impairment 
the expected future cash flows are based on management s estimates and are determined by looking at numerous factors including  but not limited to  projected economic conditions and customer demand  manufacturing capacity  operating costs and new products introduced 
although management believes its assumptions in determining the projected cash flows are reasonable  changes in those estimates could affect the evaluation 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no
