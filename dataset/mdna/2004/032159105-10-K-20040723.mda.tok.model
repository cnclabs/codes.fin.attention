item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item i of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item i  the company is primarily engaged in three business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses operated by kable 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates i revenue recognition for the magazine distribution business  including estimates of allowances for magazine returns  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii land development budgets and costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets and assets held for sale  v pension plan information  and vi legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates which are believed to be reasonable 
certain of the more critical assumptions include i distribution revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers which are recorded at the time the publications go on sale and which are generally sold on a fully returnable basis 
accordingly  management provides for estimated returns by charges to income which are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing sales information and other relevant data  including publisher and like title history  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  v pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities the discount rate  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality  and vi the company is currently involved in one significant legal proceeding which is described in item of this annual report on form k which could have a material adverse effect if decided against the company  and several routine matters 
the legal proceeding described in item is not expected to come to trial before calendar it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by a change in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations consolidated revenues increased from million in to million in  primarily due to i kable s acquisition of the subscription fulfillment business of electronic data systems corporation eds in april and ii a substantial increase in land sales activity at the company s amrep southwest real estate subsidiary 
as a result  net income increased from million  or per share  in to million  or per share  in revenues from kable s fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses collectively  magazine operations increased from million in to million in revenues from kable s fulfillment services business increased from million in to million in  principally as a result of the acquisition of the eds subscription fulfillment business mentioned above 
the revenue increase from fulfillment services was offset in part  however  by a decline in revenues from the newsstand distribution services business from million in to million in  primarily due to a decline in magazine sales rates 
kable s total operating expenses also increased as a result of the acquisition of the eds subscription fulfillment business 
operating expenses for fulfillment services increased from million in to million in  and were approximately of related revenues in compared to in fulfillment services operating costs increased slightly as a percentage of related revenues as a result of the eds acquisition  where certain costs of the acquired business s colorado location are relatively higher than at the company s other locations  and included charges of approximately million for the costs of relocating and centralizing certain fulfillment operations following the acquisition 
operating costs for newsstand distribution services decreased to million in compared to million in  but increased as a percentage of revenues from in to in  reflecting the decline in newsstand distribution services revenues 
as a result of customer losses that were identified and known prior to the acquisition of the eds subscription fulfillment business and which occurred throughout  it is anticipated that the revenues and pretax income contributed by the acquired subscription fulfillment business in will be lower than in accordingly  the results for kable s fulfillment services business for are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from land sales at the company s amrep southwest subsidiary also increased substantially in  from million in to million in this improvement was the result of greater sales of both developed and undeveloped lots in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico 
the gross profit percentages on land sales were and in and  respectively 
the pretax profit contribution from the land sales segment improved significantly in versus  reflecting the much higher revenues 
as previously reported  revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
real estate commissions and selling expenses decreased as a percentage of related revenues  from in to in  due to the closing of a higher mix of land sales in the current year without the involvement of a broker 
such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific sale transactions 
real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses decreased in versus  principally due to reduced pension expense resulting from the curtailment of future service benefits under the company s pension plan  as discussed below 
kable s general and administrative costs increased in compared to as a result of the acquisition of the eds subscription fulfillment business  partly offset by its allocable share of reduced pension expense 
interest expense increased as a result of borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisition  including for additional working capital requirements 
results for included a pretax gain of approximately million equivalent to per share from the accelerated recognition of a deferred actuarial gain due to the curtailment of future service benefits under the company s pension plan 
this resulted in consolidated pension income of  in compared to pension expense of  in see note 
revenues associated with interest and other operations decreased in compared to because there were certain non recurring revenues in  but the absence of such non recurring revenues in was partially offset by moderately higher revenues of the company s utility subsidiary 
such one time revenues in included the receipt of interest in connection with a federal tax refund claim and the settlement with an insurance company related to a claim filed in prior years 
costs of other operations remained comparable at million in and million in year ended april  compared to year ended april  net income in was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  in revenues were million in versus million in the prior year 
the revenue decrease in from principally resulted from a decrease in revenues from real estate operations from million in to million in  which was partly offset by an increase in revenues from kable s operations 
total revenues from kable s magazine operations were approximately million in compared to million in revenues from the fulfillment services business increased to approximately million in from million in  and revenues from the newsstand distribution services business decreased from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase in revenues in the fulfillment services business resulted in part from revenues derived for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition april  of the eds subscription fulfillment business and in part from an expansion of product fulfillment services 
revenues in the newsstand distribution services business decreased because  although gross billings increased slightly in line with industry results  there was a decrease in kable s net sales rate due in part to the effects of many special event publications issued throughout the prior year which increased revenues in revenues from real estate land sales decreased from million in to million in  principally as the result of certain land sales that occurred in the prior year in accordance with the company s plan to sell its landholdings outside of new mexico as part of a restructuring of its real estate operations 
during  two sales of large tracts of land in colorado and california contributed aggregate revenues of million whereas there were no land sales in these markets in revenues from land sales in new mexico were comparable on a year to year basis  approximating million in both years 
the gross profit percentage on land sales increased from in to in  primarily because the two large land sales outside of new mexico in contributed a significant amount of cash but only a very slight gross profit 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico was in and in  varying based on the specific sales prices and costs of the properties sold in each year 
revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary from period to period as a result of many factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  and thus prior results are not necessarily an indication of what may be expected to occur in future periods 
in addition  the company completed the wind down of all homebuilding activities during and realized revenues in connection therewith of approximately  representing homes delivered

real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses also decreased from million in to million in as the company continued to control costs related to administrative functions 
general and administrative costs of magazine operations remained comparable at approximately million in each year  but decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in due in part to the expansion of operations with the eds acquisition 
interest expense net decreased from million to  due to reduced average borrowing requirements in all segments of the company s operations and lower interest rates 
revenues associated with interest and other operations increased from million in to million in  primarily due to various nonrecurring revenue items in the first and second quarters of  including interest on a tax refund from the internal revenue service and the settlement with an insurance company related to a claim filed in prior years 
costs of other operations remained comparable at million in and million in the company s effective income tax rate decreased from in to in due in part to the effect of a tax benefit associated with a charitable contribution of certain land made by the real estate business in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources during the past several years  the company has financed its operations from internally generated funds from real estate sales and magazine operations  and from borrowings under its various lines of credit and construction loan agreements 
cash flows from financing activities kable has a line of credit with a bank which allows it to borrow up to million based upon a prescribed percentage of eligible accounts receivable  as defined 
at april   borrowing availability was approximately million against which million was outstanding 
this line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at april  plus  and is collateralized by substantially all of kable s assets 
the credit arrangement requires the maintenance or achievement of certain financial ratios and contains certain financial restrictions  the most significant of which limit the amount of dividends and other payments that may be made by kable to its parent or other affiliates  as well as capital expenditures and other borrowings 
this line of credit matures may  kable also has other borrowing arrangements to finance capital expenditures totaling approximately million with maturities through at a weighted average interest rate of 
amrep southwest has loan agreements with two financial institutions with a maximum borrowing capacity of million that are used to support real estate development in new mexico 
the loans  which bear interest at a weighted average of the prime rate minus  are collateralized by certain real estate assets and are subject to available collateral and various financial performance and other covenants 
at april   the borrowing availability under these agreements was approximately million against which  was outstanding with interest at the prime rate plus 
notes payable outstanding  under the line of credit and other borrowings  were million at april  compared to million at april  real estate loans decreased from million at april  to  at april  as the result of the repayment of borrowings utilizing the proceeds from various land sales 
kable s borrowings decreased from million at april  to million at april  cash flows from operating activities inventories amounted to million at april  compared to million at april  inventories in the company s core real estate market of rio rancho decreased from approximately million at april  to million at april  as the result of land sale activity 
the balance of inventory principally consisted of properties in colorado and florida

accounts payable increased by million  also reflecting this expansion 
the unfunded pension liability of the company s defined benefit retirement plan decreased from million at april  to million at april   primarily due to an increase in the value of the plan s investments

cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures were relatively comparable in and the company believes that it has adequate financing capability to provide for anticipated capital expenditures 
during  kable purchased substantially all of the assets of a subscription fulfillment business formerly owed by electronic data systems corporation and various affiliates 
the purchase price for the assets was approximately million  and consisted of million of cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed from available borrowing capacity under kable s line of credit bank arrangement  which line of credit was increased from million to million in connection with the acquisition 
future payments under contractual obligation the table below summarizes significant contractual cash obligations as of april  for the items indicated in thousands contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years notes payable    operating leases    total    recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  employer s disclosure about pensions and other post retirement benefits revised sfas no 

revised sfas retains disclosure requirements in original sfas and requires additional disclosures relating to assets  obligations  cash flows and net periodic benefit cost

segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements

 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of pretax income loss contribution of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or magazine operations businesses
