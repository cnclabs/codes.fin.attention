item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company is a financial services company  which invests in loans and securities consisting of or secured by  principally single family mortgage loans  commercial mortgage loans  manufactured housing installment loans and delinquent property tax receivables 
the loans and securities in which the company invests have generally been pooled and pledged ie securitized as collateral for non recourse bonds non recourse securitization financing  which provides long term financing for such loans while limiting credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the company earns the net interest spread between the interest income on the loans and securities in its investment portfolio and the interest and other expenses associated with the non recourse securitization financing 
the company also collects payments from property owners on its investment in delinquent property tax receivables 
the company manages the cash flow on these investments to maximize shareholders value 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based in large part upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments or uncertainties  and which may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  or the application of which may have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
the following are the company s critical accounting policies 
consolidation of subsidiaries 
the consolidated financial statements represent the company s accounts after the elimination of inter company transactions 
the company follows the equity method of accounting for investments with greater than and less than a interest in partnerships and corporate joint ventures when it is able to influence the financial and operating policies of the investee 
for all other investments  the cost method is applied 
impairments 
the company evaluates all securities in its investment portfolio for other than temporary impairments 
a security is generally defined to be other than temporarily impaired if  for a maximum period of three consecutive quarters  the carrying value of such security exceeds its estimated fair value and the company estimates  based on projected future cash flows or other fair value determinants  that the carrying value is not likely to exceed fair value in the foreseeable future 
if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist  the company records an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of the security down to its estimated fair value 
in certain instances  as a result of the other than temporary impairment analysis  the recognition or accrual of interest will be discontinued and the security will be placed on non accrual status 
the company considers an investment to be impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its recorded cost basis 
impairments of other investments are considered other than temporary when the company determines that the collection trends indicate the investment is not recoverable 
the impairment recognized on other investments is the difference between the book value of the investment and the expected collections less collection costs 
allowance for loan losses 
the company has credit risk on loans pledged in securitization financing transactions and classified as securitized finance receivables in its investment portfolio 
an allowance for loan losses has been estimated and established for currently existing probable losses to the extent losses are borne by the company under the terms of the securitization transaction 
factors considered in establishing an allowance include current loan delinquencies  historical cure rates of delinquent loans  and historical and anticipated loss severity of the loans as they are liquidated 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated and adjusted periodically by management based on the actual and estimated timing and amount of probable credit losses  using the above factors  as well as industry loss experience 
where loans are considered homogeneous  the allowance for losses are established and evaluated on a pool basis 
otherwise  the allowance for losses is established and evaluated on a loan specific basis 
provisions made to increase the allowance are a current period expense to operations 
generally  the company considers manufactured housing loans to be impaired when they are days past due 
the company also provides an allowance for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that are current as to payment but which the company has determined to be impaired based on default trends  current market conditions and empirical observable performance data on the loans 
single family loans are considered impaired when they are days past due 
commercial mortgage loans are evaluated on a loan by loans basis for impairment 
generally  commercial mortgage loans with a debt service coverage ratio less than are considered impaired 
based on the specific details of a loan  loans with a debt service coverage ratio greater than may be considered impaired  conversely  loans with a debt service coverage ratio less than may not be considered impaired 
a range of loss severity assumptions are applied to these impaired loans to determine the level of reserves necessary 
certain of the commercial mortgage loans are covered by loan guarantees that limits the company s exposure on these loans 
the level of allowance for loan losses required for these loans is reduced by the amount of applicable loan guarantees 
the company s actual credit losses may differ from those estimates used to establish the allowance 
financial condition below is a discussion of the company s financial condition 
december  amounts in thousands except per share data investments securitized finance receivables loans  net   debt securities  available for sale   other investments   securities   other loans   non recourse securitization financing   repurchase agreements  senior notes  shareholders equity   book value per common share inclusive of preferred stock liquidation preference securitized finance receivables securitized finance receivables includes loans and securities consisting of  or secured by adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage loans secured by first liens on single family properties  fixed rate loans secured by first liens on multifamily and commercial properties  and manufactured housing installment loans secured by either a ucc filing or a motor vehicle title 
as of december   the company had series of non recourse securitization financing outstanding 
the securitized finance receivables decreased to billion at december  compared to billion at december  this decrease of million is primarily the result of million in principal pay downs  million of increased allowance for loan losses  net  million of impairment charges recorded on debt securities and market value adjustments of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases resulting from million of amortization of loan discounts 
principal pay downs resulted from normal principal amortization of the underlying loan or security  and higher than anticipated prepayments on these assets due to the low interest rate environment 
allowance for loan losses have increased as a result of provisions for losses on current manufactured housing loans and additional reserves for commercial loan losses 
it is expected that the company will incur future losses such that additional reserves will be required until the company s net exposure to credit losses in the manufactured housing loans is fully reserved 
impairment charges result from other than temporary decreases in market value on debt securities backed by manufactured housing loan collateral 
other investments other investments at december  and consist primarily of delinquent property tax receivables  a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables  and associated real estate owned 
other investments decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million resulted from payments of million collected on delinquent property tax receivables and applied against the carrying value of the investment  million in sales of related real estate owned and million of valuation adjustments on the security as a result of an other than temporary impairment charge arising from lower projected cash flows from the delinquent tax receivable portfolio 
these decreases were partially offset by million of additional capitalized costs incurred and million of interest accrued in the collection of the delinquent property tax receivables 
as a result of further impairment of these assets  the accrual of interest was discontinued in october securities securities increased to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily as a result of the call and retention of a fixed rate security with a principal balance of million  amortization of million of the discount on first loss securities and a million net increase in market value of the securities 
these increases were partially offset by principal payments of million during the year  the sale of a security with a principal balance of million and the write off of six interest only strips with a principal balance of million related to the call and sale or retention of securities during unrealized losses of million are less than twelve months old 
other loans other loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to paydowns on the loans of million 
this decrease was partially offset by the redemption and subsequent termination of a mortgage backed security collateralized by million of fixed rate single family mortgage loans 
non recourse securitization financing securitization financing issued by the company are recourse only to the assets pledged as collateral  and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
non recourse securitization financing decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  this decrease was primarily a result of principal payments received of million on the associated collateral pledged which were used to pay down the securitization financing in accordance with the respective indentures 
additionally  for certain securitizations  surplus cash in the amount of million was retained within the security structure and used to repay securitization financing outstanding  instead of being released to the company 
for certain other securitizations  surplus cash in the amount of million was retained to cover losses  as certain performance triggers were not met in such securitizations 
net premium amortization of million partially offset these decreases 
repurchase agreements in december  the company entered into a million repurchase agreement to finance the call and purchase of million of fixed rate securities where the company owned the call rights on such securities

the decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss resulted principally from the decrease in the fair value of debt securities of million  and mark to market gains of million on interest rate swap and synthetic interest rate swap contracts resulting from the realization in income of losses on settled contracts and deferred gains on the remaining hedge contracts 
of million of accumulated other comprehensive loss  million is related to derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges  of which million is expected to be recognized in income during the next twelve months

provision for losses for loans increased to million in  from million in provision for losses increased by million from as a result of additions to allowance for loan losses on commercial mortgage loans of million and reserves on losses on current manufactured housing loans in the company s investment portfolio of million for compared to million for for commercial mortgage loans  underlying commercial properties concentrated in the health care and hospitality industries are generally under performing relative to expectations and are suffering from high vacancy rates and lower fees and rents 
included in is million in provision for loan losses recorded specifically for currently existing credit losses within outstanding manufactured housing loans that are current as to payment but which the company has determined to be impaired 
previously  the company had not considered current loans to be impaired under generally accepted accounting principles and therefore had not previously provided an allowance for losses for these loans 
continued worsening trends in both the industry as a whole and the company s pools of manufactured housing loans prompted the company to prepare an extensive analysis on these pools of loans 
loss severity on the manufactured housing loans continued to remain high during as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units 
defaults in on manufactured housing loans averaged on an annualized basis  versus in  and loss severity on such loans approximated during the year 
while defaults on manufactured housing loans declined relative to  defaults are expected to remain at levels 
defaults are influenced by general economic conditions in the various local markets 
impairment charges decreased from million in to an aggregate million in such impairment charges included other than temporary impairment of debt securities pledged as securitized finance receivables of million for in addition  the company incurred impairment charges in of million related to a security where the underlying property tax receivable collateral has been foreclosed and represents real estate owned  and million of losses on investments in a limited liability partnership 
the impairment charges on the debt securities result from revised expectations on related collateral 
all cash received will be applied to reduce the carrying value of the security 
gain on sale of investments for includes the gain from the sale of loans acquired through the redemption of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage pass through securities previously issued and sold by the company 
upon redemption  the company collapsed the security structure and sold the underlying loans 
in  the company entered into a million notional short position on year treasury notes futures to  in effect  mitigate its exposure to rising interest rates on a like amount of floating rate liabilities 
these instruments failed to meet the hedge criteria of sfas no 
 and were accounted for on a trading basis 
the company terminated these contracts at a loss of million in no such trading activity was engaged in by the company in the company purchased and retired million of its series a  series b and series c preferred shares in resulting in a preferred stock benefit of million which was comprised of the elimination of million of dividends in arrears which was partially offset by a million premium to book value paid to obtain the preferred shares tendered and million of period accrual of dividends on the shares remaining after the completion of the tender offer 
compared to the decrease in net loss during as compared to is primarily the result of decreases in impairment charges and an increase in net margin before provision for losses  partially offset by increases in provision for losses  and decreases in other income and gains from extinguishment of debt 
net loss per common share increased as a result of preferred stock charges in versus preferred stock benefits in the prior year  partially offset by the decrease in net loss during net interest margin before provision for losses for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net interest margin before provision for losses of million  or  was the result of an increase in the net interest spread on interest earning assets and interest income recognized on a security collateralized by delinquent property tax receivables  partially offset by the decline in interest earning assets 
the company provides for losses on its loans where it has retained credit risk 
provision for losses for loans increased to million in  from million in provision for losses increased by million as a result of additions for manufactured housing loans 
the continuing under performance of these loans prompted the company to revise its estimate of losses to include a percentage of all loans with delinquencies greater than days 
this revision  which was instituted during the fourth quarter of  resulted in an increase in provision for losses of million during the quarter 
loss severity on the manufactured housing loans continued to remain high during as a result of the saturation in the market place with both new and used repossessed manufactured housing units

the company is reviewing the implications of sop no 
but does not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations from a variety of sources 
these sources have included cash flow generated from the investment portfolio  including net interest income and principal payments and prepayments 
since  the company has focused on substantially reducing its recourse debt and minimizing its capital requirements 
the company s investment portfolio continues to provide positive cash flow  which can be utilized by the company for reinvestment or other purposes 
the company has utilized its cash flow to repay recourse debt outstanding and to initiate tender offers on its preferred stock 
in  the company completed a tender offer on is preferred stock which utilized cash of million and resulted in the issuance of million in february senior notes 
the company s cash flow from its investment portfolio for the year and quarter ended december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
such cash flow is after payment of principal and interest on the associated non recourse securitization financing ie  non recourse debt outstanding 
from the cash flow on its investment portfolio  the company funds its operating overhead costs  including the servicing of its delinquent property tax receivables  and repays any remaining recourse debt 
excluding any cash flow derived from the sale or re securitization of assets  and assuming that short term interest rates remain stable  the company anticipates that the cash flow from its investment portfolio will decline in versus as the investment portfolio continues to pay down 
the company anticipates  however  that it will have sufficient cash flow from its investment portfolio to meet all of its obligations on both a short term and long term basis

the company partially redeemed million of the february senior notes in august  and will fully redeem the remaining million in march in january  
the company initiated a recapitalization transaction  which included an offer to exchange senior notes due for outstanding shares of series a  series b and series c preferred stock 
for those holders of the series a  series b and series c preferred stock which do not exchange their shares for senior notes  the company is seeking approval by its stockholders to amend its articles of incorporation that will i designate and establish the terms of a new series d preferred stock  and ii eliminate the series a preferred stock  series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock through their conversion into shares of new series d preferred stock and common stock 
the company is offering senior notes due up to a maximum million 
the senior notes will bear interest at a rate of per annum 
non recourse securitization financing the company  through limited purpose finance subsidiaries  has issued non recourse debt in the form of securitization financings to fund the majority of its investment portfolio 
the obligations under the securitization financing structure are payable solely from the securitized finance receivables pledged and are otherwise non recourse to the company 
securitized financing is not subject to margin calls 
the maturity of each class of non recourse securitization financing is directly affected by the rate of principal prepayments on the related collateral 
each series is also subject to redemption in whole or in part at the option of the issuer and according to specific terms of the respective indentures  including when the remaining balance of the bonds equals or less of the original principal balance of the bonds  or as of a certain date 
at december   the company had billion of securitization financings outstanding 
two series of non recourse securitization financings outstanding are redeemable at the option of the company in march and august respectively 
the respective indentures provide for increases in interest rates ranging from on the underlying non recourse securitization financing classes if such classes are not called by the issuer 
for purposes of the following table  these obligations are not redeemed 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table shows expected cash payments on contractual obligations of the company for the following time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total years long term debt obligations non recourse securitization financing      repurchase agreements   senior notes   capital finance lease agreements operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities stock appreciation rights total      as the master servicer for certain of the series of non recourse securitization financing securities which it has issued  and certain loans which have been securitized but which the company is not the master servicer of the security  the company has an obligation to advance scheduled principal and interest on delinquent loans in accordance with the underlying servicing agreements should the primary servicer fail to make such advance 
such advance amounts are generally repaid in the same month as they are made  or shortly thereafter  and the contractual obligation with respect to these advances is excluded from the above table 
securitization financing is non recourse to the company as the bonds are payable solely from loans and securities pledged as securitized finance receivables 
payments due by period were estimated based on the principal repayments forecast for the underlying loans and securities  substantially all of which is used to repay the associated securitization financing outstanding 
off balance sheet arrangements the company makes various representations and warranties relating to the sale or securitization of loans 
to the extent the company were to breach any of these representations or warranties  and such breach could not be cured within the allowable time period  the company would be required to repurchase such loans  and could incur losses 
in the opinion of management  no material losses are expected to result from any such representations and warranties and  therefore  have not been accrued for as a liability

changes in quarterly average interest earning assets from those previously reported in each respective quarterly report on form q  result primarily from the reclassification of deferred hedge losses from assets to liabilities 
forward looking statements certain written statements in this form k made by the company  that are not historical fact  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may involve factors that could cause the actual results of the company to differ materially from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company cautions the public not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which may be based on assumptions and anticipated events that do not materialize 
the company does not undertake  and the securities litigation reform act specifically relieves the company from  any obligation to update any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause actual results to differ from historical results or from any results expressed or implied by forward looking statements include the following economic conditions 
the company is affected by general economic conditions 
the risk of defaults and credit losses could increase during an economic slowdown or recession 
this could have an adverse effect on the company s financial performance and the performance on the company s securitized loan pools 
capital resources 
cash flows from the investment portfolio fund the company s operations and repayments of outstanding debt  and are subject to fluctuation due to changes in interest rates  repayment rates and default rates and related losses 
interest rate fluctuations 
the company s income and cash flow depends on its ability to earn greater interest on its investments than the interest cost to finance these investments 
interest rates in the markets served by the company generally rise or fall with interest rates as a whole 
a majority of the company s investments  including loans and securities currently pledged as securitized finance receivables and securities are fixed rate 
the company currently finances these fixed rate assets through non recourse securitization financing and repurchase agreements  approximately million of which is variable rate and resets monthly 
financing fixed rate assets with variable rate bonds exposes the company to reductions in income and cash flow in a period of rising interest rates 
through the use of interest rate swaps and synthetic swaps  the company has reduced this exposure by approximately million as of december  in addition  a significant amount of the investments held by the company are adjustable rate securitized finance receivables 
these investments are financed through non recourse long term securitization financing  which reset monthly 
the net interest spread for these investments could decrease during a period of rapidly rising short term interest rates  since the investments generally have interest rates which reset on a delayed basis and have periodic interest rate caps  the related borrowing has no delayed resets or such interest rate caps 
at december   the company has approximately million of variable rate non recourse securitization financing 
defaults 
defaults by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance  if actual credit losses differ materially from estimates made by the company or exceed reserves for losses recorded in the financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated on the basis of historical experience and management s best estimates 
actual default rates or loss severity may differ from the company s estimate as a result of economic conditions 
in particular  the default rate and loss severity on the company s portfolio of manufactured housing loans has been higher than initially estimated 
actual defaults on arm loans may increase during a rising interest rate environment 
in addition  commercial mortgage loans are generally large dollar balance loans  and a significant loan default may have an adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company believes that its reserves are adequate for such risks on loans that were delinquent as of december  third party servicers 
third party servicers service the majority of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent that these servicers are financially impaired  the performance of the company s investment portfolio may deteriorate  and defaults and credit losses may be greater than estimated 
in addition  third party servicers are generally obligated to advance scheduled principal and interest on a loan if such loan is securitized  and to the extent the third party servicer fails to make this advance  the company may be required to make the advance 
prepayments 
prepayments by borrowers on loans securitized by the company may have an adverse impact on the company s financial performance 
prepayments are expected to increase during a declining interest rate or flat yield curve environment 
the company s exposure to rapid prepayments is primarily i the faster amortization of premium on the investments and  to the extent applicable  amortization of bond discount  and ii the replacement of investments in its portfolio with lower yield securities 
competition 
the financial services industry is a highly competitive market 
increased competition in the market has adversely affected the company  and may continue to do so 
regulatory changes 
the company s businesses as of december  are not subject to any material federal or state regulation or licensing requirements 
however  changes in existing laws and regulations or in the interpretation thereof  or the introduction of new laws and regulations  could adversely affect the company and the performance of the company s securitized loan pools or its ability to collect on its delinquent property tax receivables 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent to both derivative and non derivative financial instruments  and accordingly  the scope of the company s market risk management extends beyond derivatives to include all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as a financial services company  net interest margin comprises the primary component of the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a gap between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or re price within specified periods 
the company monitors the aggregate cash flow  projected net yield and estimated market value of its investment portfolio under various interest rate and prepayment assumptions 
while certain investments may perform poorly in an increasing or decreasing interest rate environment  other investments may perform well  and others may not be impacted at all 
the company focuses on the sensitivity of its investment portfolio cash flow  and measures such sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates are defined as instantaneous  parallel  and sustained interest rate movements in basis point increments 
the company estimates its net interest margin cash flow for the next twenty four months assuming interest rates over such time period follow the forward libor curve based on day eurodollar futures contracts as of december  once the base case has been estimated  cash flows are projected for each of the defined interest rate scenarios 
those scenario results are then compared against the base case to determine the estimated change to cash flow 
cash flow changes from interest rate swaps  caps  floors or any other derivative instrument are included in this analysis 
the following table summarizes the company s net interest margin cash flow and market value sensitivity analyses as of december  these analyses represent management s estimate of the percentage change in net interest margin cash flow and value expressed as a percentage change of shareholders equity  given a parallel shift in interest rates  as discussed above 
other investments are excluded from this analysis because they are not considered interest rate sensitive 
the base case represents the interest rate environment as it existed as of december  at december   one month libor was and six month libor was 
the analysis is heavily dependent upon the assumptions used in the model 
the effect of changes in future interest rates  the shape of the yield curve or the mix of assets and liabilities may cause actual results to differ significantly from the modeled results 
in addition  certain financial instruments provide a degree of optionality 
the most significant option affecting the company s portfolio is the borrowers option to prepay the loans 
the model applies prepayment rate assumptions representing management s estimate of prepayment activity on a projected basis for each collateral pool in the investment portfolio 
the model applies the same prepayment rate assumptions for all five cases indicated below 
the extent to which borrowers utilize the ability to exercise their option may cause actual results to significantly differ from the analysis 
furthermore  the projected results assume no additions or subtractions to the company s portfolio  and no change to the company s liability structure 
historically  there have been significant changes in the company s investment portfolio and the liabilities incurred by the company  including non recourse securitization financing  to finance their investments 
as a result of anticipated prepayments on assets in the investment portfolio  there are likely to be such changes in the future 
projected change in net projected change in basis point interest margin value  expressed as a increase decrease cash flow from percentage of in interest rates base case shareholders equity base the company s interest rate risk is related both to the rate of change in short term interest rates  and to the level of short term interest rates 
approximately billion of the company s investment portfolio is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates that are fixed 
approximately million of the company s investment portfolio as of december  is comprised of loans or securities that have coupon rates which adjust over time subject to certain periodic and lifetime limitations in conjunction with changes in short term interest rates 
approximately and of the arm loans underlying the company s securitized finance receivables are indexed to and reset based upon the level of six month libor and one year cmt  respectively 
generally  during a period of rising short term interest rates  the company s net interest spread earned and the corresponding cash flow on its investment portfolio will decrease 
the decrease of the net interest spread results from i fixed rate loans and investments financed with variable rate debt  ii the lag in resets of the arm loans underlying the securitized finance receivables relative to the rate resets on the associated borrowings  and iii rate resets on the arm loans which are generally limited to every six months or every twelve months and subject to lifetime caps  while the associated borrowings have no such limitation 
as to item i  the company has substantially limited its interest rate risk on such investments through i the issuance of fixed rate non recourse securitization financing which approximated billion as of december   and ii equity  which was million 
in addition  the company has entered into interest rate swaps and synthetic swaps to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on fixed rate investments financed with variable rate bonds as further discussed below 
as to items ii and iii  as short term interest rates stabilize and the arm loans reset  the net interest margin may be partially restored as the yields on the arm loans adjust to market conditions 
in addition  the company has entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure on million in notional value of its variable rate bonds 
the swap agreement has been constructed such that the company will pay interest at a fixed rate of on the notional amount and will receive interest based on one month libor on the same notional amount 
the impact on cash flows from the interest rate swap has been included in the table above for each of the respective interest rate scenarios 
an additional approximate million of floating rate liabilities are being converted to a fixed rate through an amortizing synthetic swap created by the short sale of a string of eurodollar futures contract in october the synthetic swap has an estimated duration of years 
as of december   the weighted average fixed rate cost of the synthetic swap to the company is 
conversely  net interest margin may increase following a fall in short term interest rates 
this increase may be temporary as the yields on the arm loans adjust to the new market conditions after a lag period 
the net interest spread may also be increased or decreased by the proceeds or costs of interest rate swap  cap or floor agreements  to the extent that the company has entered into such agreements
