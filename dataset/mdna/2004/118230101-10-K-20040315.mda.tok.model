subsequent integrity expenditures are expensed as incurred 
accordingly  over time  integrity expenditures will shift from capital to operating expenditures 
expansion and cost reduction expenditures include projects to facilitate increased pipeline volumes  extend the pipeline incrementally to new facilities  expand terminal facilities or improve the efficiency of operations 
the expected increase in expansion expenditures relates principally to the continued investment in the ohio indiana project  additional capacity expansions in the partnership s eastern operations and a joint venture project with wespac to construct an airport delivery and terminalling facility

substantially all of these lease payments may be canceled at any time should the leased property no longer be required for operations 
the general partner leases space in an office building and certain office equipment and charges these costs to the operating partnerships 
buckeye leases certain computing equipment and automobiles 
future minimum lease payments under these noncancelable operating leases at december  were as follows  for   for   for   for   for and none thereafter 
buckeye entered into an energy services agreement for certain main line pumping equipment and the natural gas requirements to fuel this equipment at its linden  new jersey facility 
under the energy services agreement  which is designed to reduce power costs at the linden facility  buckeye is required to pay a minimum of  annually over the next eight years 
this minimum payment is based on an annual minimum usage requirement of the natural gas engines at the rate of per kilowatt hour equivalent 
in addition to the annual usage requirement  buckeye is subject to minimum usage requirements during peak and off peak periods 
buckeye s use of the natural gas engines has exceeded the minimum annual requirement in each of the three years ended december  rent expense under operating leases was   and  for  and  respectively

purchase obligations generally represent commitments for recurring operating expenses or capital projects 
environmental matters the operating partnerships are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations  as well as the partnership s own standards relating to protection of the environment  cause the operating partnerships to incur current and ongoing operating and capital expenditures 
environmental expenses are incurred in connection with emergency response activities associated with the release of petroleum products to the environment from the partnership s pipelines and terminals  and in connection with longer term environmental remediation efforts which may involve groundwater monitoring and treatment 
the partnership regularly incurs expenses in connection with these environmental remediation activities 
in  the operating partnerships incurred operating expenses of million and  at december   had million accrued for environmental matters 
of the expenses incurred in  approximately million was incurred in connection with a product release from underground piping at the partnership s rochester  new york terminal  and approximately  was incurred in connection with a pipeline release in illinois 
approximately million of additional expense associated with the illinois release is expected to be reimbursed by the partnership s insurance carriers 
expenditures  both capital and operating  relating to environmental matters are expected to continue due to the partnership s commitment to maintain high environmental standards and to increasingly rigorous environmental laws 
various claims for the cost of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and for damage to the environment resulting from the activities of the operating partnerships or their predecessors have been asserted and may be asserted in the future under various federal and state laws 
the general partner believes that the generation  handling and disposal of hazardous substances by the operating partnerships and their predecessors have been in material compliance with applicable environmental and regulatory requirements 
the total potential remediation costs to be borne by the operating partnerships relating to these clean up sites cannot be reasonably estimated and could be material 
with respect to certain sites  however  the operating partnership involved is one of several or as many as several hundred prps that would share in the total costs of clean up under the principle of joint and several liability 
although the partnership has made a provision for certain legal expenses relating to these and other environmental matters  the general partner is unable to determine the timing or outcome of any pending proceedings or future claims or proceedings 
see business environmental matters and legal proceedings 
competition and other business conditions several major refiners and marketers of petroleum products announced strategic alliances or mergers in recent years 
these alliances or mergers have the potential to alter refined product supply and distribution patterns within the operating partnerships market area resulting in both gains and losses of volume and revenue 
while the general partner believes that individual delivery locations within its market area may have significant gains or losses  it is not possible to predict the overall impact these alliances or mergers may have on the operating partnerships business 
however  the general partner does not believe that these alliances or mergers will have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
in the midwest  several petroleum product pipeline expansions and two new petroleum product pipeline construction projects have recently been completed 
while these projects may alter supply sources with respect to the partnership s service area  they are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the operating partnership s results of operations or financial condition 
certain changes in refined petroleum product specifications are likely to impact the transportation of refined petroleum products over the next several years 
methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  a gasoline additive used for air pollution control purposes  is scheduled to be phased out of use in certain states commencing in the phase out of mtbe may result in a reduction in gasoline volumes delivered in the partnership s service area 
the partnership is unable to quantify the amount by which its transportation volumes might be affected by the phase out of mtbe 
in addition  new requirements for the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel  which will be phased in commencing in through  could require significant capital expenditures at certain locations in order to permit the partnership to handle this new product grade 
at this time the partnership is unable to predict the timing or amount of capital or operating expenditures that would be required to enable the partnership to transport and store ultra low sulfur diesel fuel

the partnership contributed  lp units to services company in august in exchange for the elimination of the partnership s obligation to reimburse bmc for certain executive compensation costs  a reduction of the incentive compensation paid by the partnership to bmc under the existing incentive compensation agreement  and other changes that made the esop a less expensive fringe benefit for the partnership 
funding for the esop notes is provided by distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and from cash payments from the partnership  as required to cover any shortfall between the distributions that services company receives on the lp units that it owns and amounts currently due under the esop notes the top up reserve 
the partnership will also incur esop related costs for routine administrative costs and taxes associated with annual taxable income or the sale of lp units  if any 
total esop related costs charged to earnings were million in  million in and million in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to select appropriate accounting principles from those available  to apply those principles consistently and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect revenues and associated costs as well as reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
generally  the timing and amount of revenue recognized by an organization is among the most critical of accounting policies to be adopted 
for its pipeline operations  which constitutes approximately the partnership s revenues  the partnership recognizes revenue as the product is delivered to customers 
terminalling and storage revenues  representing approximately of the partnership s revenues  are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from contract pipeline operations  representing approximately of the partnership s revenues  are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues for contract operations include both direct costs to be reimbursed by the customer under the contract and an operating fee 
in all cases  the partnership s revenue recognition approximates billings to the customer 
because the partnership s customers generally consist of major integrated oil companies  petroleum refiners and petrochemical companies  collections experience has historically been good and the partnership has not required an allowance for bad debts 
some of the partnership s customers consist of major airlines  some of whom have experienced financial difficulties or even bankruptcy following the events of september  however  the partnership s credit monitoring policies  coupled with its ability to require prepayment of transportation charges  has limited its exposure to losses from potentially uncollectible accounts 
bad debts are written off as incurred 
approximately of the partnership s consolidated assets consist of property  plant and equipment 
property plant and equipment consists of pipeline and related transportation facilities and equipment  including land  rights of way  buildings and leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment 
pipeline assets are generally self constructed  using either contractors or the partnership s own employees 
additions and improvement to the pipeline are capitalized based on the cost of the improvement while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
pipeline integrity expenditures are capitalized the first time such expenditures are incurred  when such expenditures improve or extend the life of the pipeline or related assets 
subsequent integrity expenditures are expensed as incurred 
during  and  the partnership capitalized million  million and million  respectively  of integrity expenditures 
over the next several years  the partnership expects integrity expenditures  both capital and operating  to range between million and million per year 
during this time  the portion of expenditures capitalized is expected to decrease and the portion recorded as expense is expected to increase 
as discussed under environmental matters above  the operating partnerships are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment 
environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations  and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation  are expensed 
liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or clean ups are probable  and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
generally  the timing of these accruals coincides with the partnership s commitment to a formal plan of action 
accrued environmental remediation related expenses include estimates of direct costs of remediation and indirect costs related to the remediation effort  such as compensation and benefits for employees directly involved in the remediation activities and fees paid to outside engineering  consulting and law firms 
the partnership maintains insurance which may cover in whole or in part certain environmental expenditures 
during  the operating partnerships incurred operating expenses of million and  at december   had million accrued for environmental matters 
the environmental accruals are revised as new matters arise  or as new facts in connection with environmental remediation projects require a revision of estimates previously made with respect to the probable cost of such remediation projects 
in the event a known environmental liability results in expenditures that exceed the amount that has been accrued in connection with the matter  the additional expenditures would result in an increase in expenses and a reduction in income  in the period when the additional expense is incurred 
based on its experience  however  the partnership believes that the amounts it has accrued for the future costs related to environmental liabilities is reasonable 
related party transactions with respect to related party transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements and item of part iii included elsewhere in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability related to the retirement of long lived assets be recorded at the time a legal obligation is incurred 
a corresponding asset is recorded at that time which is then depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
after the initial measurement  the obligation is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the asset retirement obligation s fair value 
if and when it is determined that a legal obligation has been incurred  the fair value of any liability is determined based on estimates and assumptions related to retirement costs  future inflation rates and credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
the partnership adopted sfas no 
effective january  the operating partnerships assets generally consist of underground refined products pipelines installed along rights of way acquired from land owners and related above ground facilities that are owned by the operating partnerships 
the partnership is unable to predict if and when its pipelines  which generally serve high population and high demand markets  would become completely obsolete and require decommissioning 
further  the operating partnerships rights of way agreements typically do not require the dismantling and removal of the pipelines and reclamation of the rights of way upon permanent removal of the pipelines from service 
accordingly  the partnership has recorded no liability  or corresponding asset  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
because the future dismantlement and removal dates of the partnership s assets  and the amount of any associated costs are indeterminate

in january  the staff of the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the purpose of fasb staff position no 
is to provide guidance on how recent federal legislation which provides certain prescription drug benefits and subsidies to sponsors of certain medical plans which substitute benefits for medicare part d is to be incorporated into a plan sponsor s calculation of retiree medical liabilities 
there are significant uncertainties about how this federal legislation will ultimately affect plan sponsors liabilities with respect to retiree medical costs 
fasb staff position no 
 which is effective for fiscal years ending after december   permits plan sponsors  like the partnership  to defer the accounting effects of the legislation until authoritative guidance on how to account for the federal legislation is provided  or a significant event occurs  such as a plan amendment  settlement or curtailment  which would require a remeasurement of a plan s assets and obligations 
the partnership has elected to defer the accounting recognition of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of until such time as authoritative guidance is provided 
accordingly  measures related to the accumulated benefit obligation and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the partnership s financial statements do not reflect the effects of the act on the plan 
when authoritative guidance to plan sponsors is provided  such guidance could cause financial information related to retiree medical benefits previously reported to change 
the partnership has not yet evaluated the provisions of the act in order to determine how the prescription drug benefits and potential subsidies will affect the partnership

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk trading instruments currently the partnership has no derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activity with respect to trading instruments 
market risk other than trading instruments the partnership is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
the partnership does not have significant commodity or foreign exchange risk 
the partnership is exposed to fair value risk with respect to the fixed portion of its financing arrangements the notes and the notes and to cash flow risk with respect to its variable rate obligations 
fair value risk represents the risk that the value of the fixed portion of its financing arrangements will rise or fall depending on changes in interest rates 
cash flow risk represents the risk that interest costs related to the variable portion of its financing arrangements the credit facilities will rise or fall depending on changes in interest rates 
at december   the partnership had total debt of million  consisting of million of the notes and million of the notes 
the fair value of these obligations at december  was approximately million 
the partnership estimates that a decrease in rates for obligations of similar maturities would increase the fair value of these obligations by million 
in order to hedge a portion of its fair value risk related to the notes  on october   the partnership entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution with respect to million principal amount the notional amount of the notes 
the contract calls for the partnership to receive fixed payments from the financial institution at a rate of of the notional amount in exchange for floating rate payments from the partnership based on the notional amount using a rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor  determined in arrears  minus 
the agreement terminates on the maturity date of the notes and interest amounts under the agreement are payable semiannually on the same date as the interest payments on the notes 
at the inception of the agreement  the partnership designated the agreement as a fair value hedge and determined that no ineffectiveness will result from the use of the hedge 
during the two months of that the hedge was outstanding  the partnership saved million and  based on libor at december   the partnership would save approximately million per year compared to interest expense the partnership would incur had the partnership not engaged in this transaction 
changes in libor  however  will impact the interest rate expense incurred in connection with the interest rate swap 
for example  a increase or decrease in libor would increase or decrease interest expense by million per year 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap was a gain of approximately million at december  the partnership s practice with respect to hedge transactions has been to have each transaction authorized by the board of directors of the general partner
