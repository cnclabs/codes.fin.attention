increase increase decrease decrease net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit margins selling  general and administrative expenses    our discontinued operations sales decreased by  to  or for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  this decline is due to many factors including tighter municipal budgets through out the sales territories and the entire country  and a down turn in the economy resulting in less tax revenues which results in less available funds for the fire departments 
in addition  fire departments have partially altered the focus of their purchasing to include merchandise that relates to biological and chemical items and homeland security products  which this segment does not market 
another reason for this decline is increased competition from a company owned by a minority shareholder of this segment and who was the previous owner of one of the companies within the fire and police segment

the company s pharmacy subsidiary  daw  inc  has an operating agreement with the parent company which includes cash management 
the minority shareholders have declined to provide the parent company with sufficient cash to sustain its present operations and fund the medical segment  if necessary 
these factors raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to increase working capital in the medical and corporate segments  adco has  subsequent to year end  negotiated a line of credit from a bank in the amount of  collaterized by the property owned by adco and such line of credit is also guaranteed by the company 
management s plan to return to profitability includes revamping management at the corporate and medical segments  instituting cost cutting measures to reduce and control general and administrative costs  and consolidating certain entities to reduce costs

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the primary use of cash for the year june  was to fund operations for our medical and corporate opera tions  as well as the pharmacies inventory

the net cash used in investing activities was  for the year june  as compared to  for the year ended june  and  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  the decrease of  was mainly the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the decrease for the ended june  was mainly due to the acquisition of two pharmacies and the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the increase for the year ended june  was largely due to the proceeds received from marketable securities 
in fiscal  we acquired two pharmacies and remodeled some existing pharmacy locations 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended june  was mainly due to increased repayments of long term debt as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  and  for the years ended june  and this was due to issuance of long term debt of  and  for the years june  and june  the repayment of stock sales receivable of  for the year june  and increased repayments of long term debt notes to related party

accounts receivable at june   we had net accounts receivable of approximately million as compared to approximately million at june  although our sales have increased approximately million  our accounts receivables have remained approximately the same 
the reasons for the decrease are more timely payments and an increase in sales in the pharmacies segment and a reduction in sales in the medical segment 
debt at june   we had  of debt as compared to  at june  our debt decreased due to the pay down of existing debt with no additional debt at june  forward looking statements the statement made in item  relating to eaton s opportunity to serve assisted living facilities is a forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
additionally  words such as expects  intends  believes and similar words are used to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of the act 
the results anticipated by any and all of these forward looking statements may not occur 
important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include eaton could be affected by increased competition from large competitors including the entrance of wal mart and other nationwide and regional discount operations  the state of the economy in the local communities in new england where the company operates  the general state of the economy in the united states and elsewhere  the failure of suppliers to timely deliver products  factors which increase costs in the health care industry  the loss of any single large customer  and recent and future governmental regulation of pharmaceutical pricing 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrinkage  impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventories included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrinkage  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we considered historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates upon which that our reserves were based  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the assets 
goodwill impairment in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our tests during the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our companies 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income taxes the company concluded that it is more likely than not that it will utilize the carryforwards and certain other deferred tax assets 
based on available evidence  it is uncertain when the company will utilize the other deferred tax assets  principally timing difference relating to allowances  depreciation and intangible assets  and  therefore it is more likely than not that the timing difference will not be utilized and a valuation allowance has been provided
