item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a healthcare provider focused primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we own and operate hospitals in partnership with physicians whom we believe have established reputations for clinical excellence as well as with community hospital systems 
we opened our first hospital in  and currently have ownership interest in and operate hospitals  excluding the heart hospital of milwaukee  which was sold on december  we have majority ownership of of these hospitals and a minority interest in one 
each of our majority owned hospitals is a freestanding  licensed general acute care hospital that provides a wide range of health services  and the medical staff at each of our hospitals includes qualified physicians in various specialties 
our hospitals have a total of licensed beds and are located in eight states arizona  arkansas  california  louisiana  new mexico  ohio  south dakota  and texas 
in addition to our hospitals  we own and or manage cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
we began our cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic business in we currently own and or manage cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities 
twelve of these facilities are located at hospitals operated by other parties and offer invasive diagnostic and  in some cases  therapeutic procedures 
the remaining facilities are not located at hospitals and offer only diagnostic procedures 
basis of consolidation 
we have included in our consolidated financial statements hospitals and cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities over which we exercise substantive control  including all entities in which we own more than a interest  as well as variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary 
we have used the equity method of accounting for entities  including variable interest entities  in which we hold less than a interest and over which we do not exercise substantive control  and are not the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the one hospital in which we hold a minority interest at september   avera heart hospital of south dakota  is excluded from the net revenue and operating expenses of our consolidated company and our consolidated hospital division 
similarly  a number of our diagnostic and therapeutic facilities are excluded from the net revenue and operating results of our consolidated company and our consolidated diagnostics division 
our minority interest in these entities results of operations for the periods discussed is recognized as part of the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in our statements of operations in accordance with the equity method of accounting 
upon applying the new accounting principles set forth by interpretation no 
 effective march   we began consolidating in our diagnostics division  a managed entity in which we do not hold any equity ownership interest and have not historically consolidated 
the consolidation of this managed entity s results of operations began april  and resulted in an increase in our net revenue of million and an increase in our operating expenses of million  for the year ended september   but did not have any impact on our net income since the managed entity operates at breakeven as a result of our management fee structure 

table of contents same facility hospitals 
our policy is to include in our same facility basis only those facilities that were open and operational during the full current and prior fiscal year comparable periods 
for example  on a same facility basis for our consolidated hospital division for the fiscal year ended september   we exclude the results of operations of our four newest hospitals  louisiana heart hospital  the heart hospital of milwaukee  texsan heart hospital  and heart hospital of lafayette  which opened in february  october  january and march  respectively 
hospital ownership and capital structure 
each of our consolidated hospitals is organized as either a limited liability company or limited partnership  with one of our wholly owned subsidiaries serving as the manager or general partner and typically holding from to of the ownership interest in the entity 
in most cases  our physician partners own the remaining ownership interests as members or limited partners 
in some instances  local market conditions have made it advantageous for us to organize a hospital with a community hospital investing as a partner in addition to physicians 
in two of our hospitals  there currently are hospital partners that hold ownership interests of and  respectively 
newly opened hospitals during fiscal on october   we opened our eleventh hospital  which is located in glendale  wisconsin 
this hospital obtained its accreditation from jcaho on october  the heart hospital of milwaukee opened with inpatient beds 
on january   we opened our twelfth hospital  which is located in san antonio  texas  and obtained its accreditation from jcaho on january  this hospital is designed to accommodate inpatient beds and opened initially with licensed beds that will be staffed and available as the hospital ramps up its operations 
on march   we opened our thirteenth hospital  which is located in lafayette  louisiana 
this hospital obtained its accreditation from jcaho on march  heart hospital of lafayette opened with inpatient beds that will be staffed and available as the hospital ramps up its operations 
upon opening heart hospital of lafayette  we have completed our hospital expansion plans that commenced three years ago  and we do not currently have any other hospitals under development 
new hospital development 
once the entity that will own a new hospital is formed and the partners have contributed their capital  it typically takes approximately to months to develop the hospital 
as of september  the development costs for our six most recently opened hospitals  including the cost of equipment and capitalized construction period interest  have ranged from million to million depending on the size of the hospital and its location 
these costs were incurred throughout the construction period  with approximately of the costs being incurred in the last six months before opening the hospital 
in addition  we incur pre opening expenses throughout the development process  with the majority of these expenses incurred during the six to eight month period immediately prior to opening the hospital 
pre opening expenses for our nine most recently opened hospitals have ranged between million and million per hospital 
approximately of these pre opening expenses were for personnel and for marketing and advertising 
the balance was distributed among several categories including staff recruitment and relocation  office and equipment rentals  travel and meals for the staff and other operating expenses such as property taxes  legal expenses  insurance and utilities 
the medicare modernization act imposes a moratorium on the development of new physician owned specialty hospitals  as such hospitals are defined in the statute and in regulations that may be issued by hhs 
this moratorium is expected to end on june  absent further congressional action 
hospital closure and asset sale 
on november   we entered into an agreement to sell the assets  excluding accounts receivable and certain computer equipment  of the heart hospital of milwaukee for a purchase price of million 
as a condition of the sale  which was completed on december   we closed the facility in late november 
for a detailed discussion of transaction and selected financial information related to the heart hospital of milwaukee  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents revenue sources by division 
the largest percentage of our net revenue is attributable to our hospital division 
the following table sets forth the percentage contribution of each of our consolidating divisions to consolidated net revenue in the periods indicated below 
year ended september  division hospital diagnostics corporate and other net revenue revenue sources by payor 
we receive payments for our services rendered to patients from the medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations  and our patients directly 
generally  our net revenue is determined by a number of factors  including the payor mix  the number and nature of procedures performed and the rate of payment for the procedures 
since cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects those age and older  the proportion of net revenue we derive from the medicare program is higher than that of most general acute care hospitals 
the following table sets forth the percentage of consolidated net revenue we earned by category of payor in each of our last three fiscal years 
year ended september  payor medicare medicaid commercial and other  including self pay total consolidated net revenue we are reimbursed by non governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies  such as fee for service charges and rates based on diagnosis related groups 
we limit the number of per diem contracts we accept from managed care organizations because we believe these contracts do not reimburse us sufficiently for the efficiencies that we achieve in our hospitals 
we do not accept capitation contracts from any payors 
a significant portion of our net revenue is derived from federal and state governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
we expect the net revenue that we receive from the medicare program as a percentage of total consolidated net revenue will remain significant in future periods because the percentage of our total consolidated net revenue generated by our hospital division will continue to increase as we ramp up operations of our new hospitals 
our payor mix may fluctuate in future periods due to changes in reimbursement  market and industry trends with self pay patients and other similar factors 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  retroactive and prospective rate adjustments  administrative rulings  court decisions  executive orders and freezes and funding reductions  all of which may significantly affect our business 
in addition  reimbursement is generally subject to adjustment following audit by third party payors  including the fiscal intermediaries who administer the medicare program for cms 
final determination of amounts due providers under the medicare program often takes several years because of such audits  as well as resulting provider appeals and the application of technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might result from these programs  however  due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
see business reimbursement and regulation 
we do not expect changes in the outlier formula for fiscal to have a material effect on our outlier payments in fiscal however  we do expect that the increase in payment rates and revised wage indexes in fiscal will increase our net revenue by approximately million to million 
however  because the regulations are subject to change  and due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and 
table of contents medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted and the other complexities involved in estimating the impact of these announced changes on our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that our estimates will change by a material amount in the near future 
medicare reimburses hospitals for capital related costs using one of two alternative methodologies based upon whether the hospital is categorized as new under the regulations of cms 
on august   one of the company s medicare fiscal intermediaries notified the company that it had been directed by cms to change  on a retroactive and prospective basis  the capital cost reimbursement methodology applicable to four of its hospitals 
this position was contrary to a previously written determination the company had received from that fiscal intermediary on october  that confirmed the methodology being applied by those hospitals 
consistent with management s belief that the position taken by the fiscal intermediary in october was based upon a correct interpretation of applicable cms regulations  the company began  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  to vigorously pursue its administrative  judicial and other remedies to challenge the matter with the fiscal intermediary and cms 
however  the company has recognized capital reimbursement subsequent to august  consistent with the payments received under the new methodology beginning on that date 
during february  we learned that cms  after considering its position  had determined that the change in capital reimbursement methodology would be effective august   and that the change would not be applied retroactively to any periods prior to that effective date 
the impact of this change for fiscal was a million reduction in our net revenue and for fiscal was a million reduction in our net revenue from the amount that would have been recognized under the previous reimbursement method 
we believe the impact will diminish rapidly in future years  based on how reimbursement is calculated  and we estimate that the cumulative negative impact for fiscal years through will be from million to million 
critical accounting policies general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes as experience develops or new information becomes known 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we define critical accounting policies as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine and have the potential to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs such as medicare and medicaid and other third party payors such as commercial insurers  health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations are generally less than our established billing rates 
payment arrangements with third party payors may include prospectively determined rates per discharge or per visit  a discount from established charges  per diem payments  reimbursed costs subject to limits and or other similar contractual arrangements 
as a result  net revenue for services rendered to patients is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts as services are rendered 
we account for the difference between the estimated realizable rates under the reimbursement program and the standard billing rates as contractual adjustments  which are accrued on an estimated basis in the period that the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known and final settlements are determined 
estimates of contractual adjustments are made on a payor specific basis and based on the best information available regarding our interpretation of the applicable laws  regulations and contract terms 
we continually review the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations and any changes in the contractual terms of our programs 
final 
table of contents settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties  which can take several years to determine 
we record adjustments to the estimated billings as contractual adjustments in the periods that such adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
due to the complexity of laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs  the manner in which they are interpreted  and the other complexities involved in estimating our net revenue  there is a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
we also provide care to patients who meet certain criteria under our charity care policy without charge or at amounts less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported as net revenue 
our managed diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under fixed rate and percentage of income arrangements as services are rendered 
in addition  certain diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories recognize additional revenue under cost reimbursement and equipment lease arrangements 
net revenue from our owned diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts due from patients  third party payors  and others as services are rendered  including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
our consulting and management operations  which are included in our corporate and other division  operate under various contracts where management fee revenue is recognized under various percentage of income and cost reimbursement arrangements and consulting and other revenue under service contractual arrangements as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients in our hospital division 
the remainder of our accounts receivable principally consist of amounts due from billings to hospitals for various cardiovascular care services performed in our diagnostics division and amounts due under consulting and management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
we estimate this allowance based on such factors as payor mix  aging and the historical collection experience and write offs of our respective hospitals and other business units 
adverse changes in business office operations  payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care reimbursement could affect our collection of accounts receivable 
general and professional liability risk 
on june   our three year combined insurance policy that provided medical malpractice claims coverage on a claims made  first dollar basis  expired and we entered into a new partially self insured coverage program 
at that time  we purchased a tail insurance policy to provide first dollar coverage for claims incurred prior to june   but not reported as of that date under the expired claims made policy 
we recognized the full cost of the tail insurance policy as an operating expense in the third quarter of fiscal as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
from june  through june   we were partially self insured under a claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim 
effective june   we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage for claim amounts in excess of million of retained liability per claim  subject to million of retained liability per claim for the first two claims reported during the policy year at one of our hospitals on june   we extended this claims made policy through june  on june   we entered into a new one year claims made policy providing coverage at the same amounts as were in effect during the policy year 
because of our self insured retention levels  we are required to recognize an estimated expense liability for the amount of our retained liability applicable to each malpractice claim 
as of september  and september   the total estimated liability for our self insured retention on medical malpractice claims  including an estimated amount for incurred but not reported claims  was approximately million and million  respectively  which is included in current liabilities in 
table of contents our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on actuarial estimates prepared by an independent third party  who bases the estimates on our historical experience with claims and assumptions about future events 
in addition to reserves for medical malpractice  we also maintain reserves for our self insured healthcare and dental coverage provided to our employees 
as of september  and september   our total estimated reserve for self insured liabilities on employee health and dental claims was million and million  respectively  which is included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
we maintain this reserve based on our historical experience with claims 
we also maintain commercial stop loss coverage for our health and dental insurance program of  per plan participant 
we continually review our estimates for self insured liabilities and record adjustments as experience develops or new information becomes known 
the changes to the estimated liabilities are included in current operating results 
due to the considerable variability that is inherent in such estimates  including such factors as changes in medical costs and changes in actual experience  there is a reasonable possibility that the recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
also  there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets of businesses purchased 
other intangible assets primarily consist of the value of management contracts 
with the exception of goodwill  intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we evaluate goodwill annually on september for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
in september  we performed a goodwill impairment test  the results of which concluded our goodwill was impaired 
based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  the million impairment charge consisted of million related to our hospital division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to million at september   and million related to our diagnostics division reporting unit  which reduced its remaining goodwill to at september  the testing performed in september indicated that no additional impairment was required in fiscal long lived assets 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows as an estimate of fair value 
the determination of whether or not long lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets 
changes in the our strategy  assumptions and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long lived assets 
during the year ended september   we recorded a million impairment charge relating to certain software costs associated with the purchase of an enterprise wide healthcare information system  which had been installed in two of our hospitals 
due to a number of functionality and integration issues experienced with this system  we determined that the system is not performing to its original specifications and thus will be replaced at the two hospitals where it has been installed and will not be installed in any additional hospitals as stated in the original license 
the impairment charge reflects unamortized costs associated with the acquisition  development and implementation of the system 
earnings allocated to minority interests 
earnings allocated to minority interests represent the allocation of profits and losses to minority owners in our consolidated subsidiaries 
because our hospitals are owned as joint 
table of contents ventures  each hospital s earnings and losses are generally allocated for accounting purposes to us and our physician and community hospital partners on a pro rata basis in accordance with the respective ownership percentages in the hospital 
if  however  the cumulative net losses of a hospital exceed its initial capitalization and committed capital obligations of our partners  then we are required  due to the respective at risk capital positions  by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america to recognize a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s losses  instead of the smaller pro rata share of the losses that normally would be allocated to us based upon our percentage ownership 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s losses would reduce our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
when the same hospital has earnings in a subsequent period  a disproportionately higher share  up to  of the hospital s earnings will be allocated to us to the extent we have previously recognized a disproportionate share of that hospital s losses 
the disproportionate allocation to us of a hospital s earnings would increase our consolidated net income in that reporting period 
the determination of at risk capital position is based on the specific terms of each hospital s operating agreement  including each partner s contributed capital  obligation to contribute additional capital to provide working capital loans  or to guarantee the outstanding obligations of the hospital 
during each of our fiscal years  and  our disproportionate recognition of earnings losses in our hospitals had a positive negative impact of million  million  and million  respectively  on our reported income loss before income taxes 
we expect our earnings allocated to minority interests to fluctuate in future periods as we either recognize disproportionate losses and or recoveries thereof through disproportionate profits of our hospitals 
as of september   we had remaining cumulative disproportionate loss allocations of approximately million that we may recover in future periods  or be required to recognize additional disproportionate losses  depending on the results of operations of each of our hospitals 
we could also be required to recognize disproportionate losses at our other hospitals not currently in disproportionate allocation depending on their results of operations in future periods 
income taxes 
income taxes are computed on the pretax income loss based on current tax law 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or their future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year statement of operations data 
the following table presents our results of operations in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue year ended september  of net increase decrease revenue net revenue operating expenses personnel expense medical supplies expense bad debt expense other operating expenses pre opening expenses depreciation amortization loss on disposal of property  equipment and other assets impairments of goodwill and long lived assets income loss from operations other income expenses interest expense interest income loss on debt refinancing other income  net equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates loss before minority interest and income taxes minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  of this million increase in net revenue  our hospital division generated a million increase  which was partially offset by a million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations 
the million increase in hospital division net revenue was attributable to million of net revenue growth from our four newest hospitals  including louisiana heart hospital which opened on february   the heart hospital of milwaukee which opened on october   texsan heart hospital which opened january   and heart hospital of lafayette which opened march   as well as million of growth among our same facility hospitals 
on a consolidated basis  hospital admissions increased and adjusted admissions increased for fiscal compared to fiscal also on a consolidated basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased and inpatient surgical procedures increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  while average length of stay decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal 
table of contents the million increase in net revenue contributed by our same facility hospitals  along with the increases in admissions of  adjusted admissions of  inpatient catheterization procedures of  and inpatient surgical procedures of within our same facility hospitals was largely due to the growth in operations of harlingen medical center and tucson heart hospital as well as the re opening of bakersfield heart hospital s emergency department during the second quarter of fiscal after it was closed in the third quarter of fiscal the million decrease in our diagnostics division net revenue was the net result of several key changes in this division 
gaston cardiology services llc  which was dissolved in november  contributed incremental revenue of million in as compared to this decline in revenue was partially offset by million in new diagnostic and therapeutic business developed since and a million increase in our same facility diagnostic services 
the increase in same facility diagnostic services was primarily the net result of growth in the number of procedures performed  including new services added  offset in part by a decline in the number of procedures performed in our mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories during fiscal as compared to fiscal the million decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to two key changes in that business 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we restructured one of our two physician management contracts  which reduced management fee revenue  but more significantly eliminated a pass through cost reimbursement arrangement 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed certain vendor relationships associated with our second physician management contract to eliminate a substantial amount of pass through cost reimbursement revenue  as previously discussed 
the cost reimbursement changes under these two contracts reduced both our net revenue and certain of our operating expenses by corresponding amounts  and therefore had no impact on our consolidated income from operations or our consolidated net income during fiscal personnel expense 
personnel expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in personnel expense was primarily due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
of the million increase in hospital division personnel expense  our four new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals personnel expense was primarily attributable to increased staffing to support the growth in admissions  inpatient catheterization and surgical procedures during the year 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s personnel expense was due to the change in the physician management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursed costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense decreased slightly to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower same facility hospital personnel costs relative to higher net revenue as compared to prior year  offset by high personnel costs relative to net revenue associated with the ramp up of the heart hospital of milwaukee  heart hospital of lafayette and texsan heart hospital 
on an adjusted patient day basis  personnel expense for our consolidated hospitals increased to  per adjusted patient day for fiscal from  per adjusted patient day for fiscal personnel expense on an adjusted patient day basis for our same facility hospitals declined to from  for these comparable periods  which we believe is the result of our concentration on staffing levels  recruiting and retention of nurses in our hospitals  and a decrease in contract labor 
medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in medical supplies expense was due to a million increase in our hospital division and a million increase in our diagnostics division 
of the million increase in our hospital division s medical supplies expense  our four new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals medical supplies expense was attributable to the increases in catheterization and surgical procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal moreover  the increase in surgical procedures during was disproportionately comprised of cardiac procedures that use high cost medical devices and 
table of contents supplies  such as automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillators aicd  pacemaker procedures  and drug eluting stents 
during fiscal  we experienced a increase in the number of aicd procedures compared to fiscal we have experienced a general trend over the past year in which the number of surgical procedures involving aicd and other higher cost medical devices and supplies has increased as a component of our mix of procedures 
in addition  the introduction of drug eluting stents in april contributed to higher medical supplies expense during fiscal compared to fiscal approximately of our cardiac procedures involving stents utilized drug eluting stents compared to for fiscal further  our average utilization rate for drug eluting stents in this was stents per case during fiscal as compared to stents per case during fiscal therefore  hospital division medical supplies expense per adjusted patient day increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  reflecting the increase in procedures that use high costs devices and drug eluting stents 
the million increase in diagnostics division medical supplies expense was primarily attributable to the net growth in its same facility operations  new diagnostic and therapeutic business and the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents during fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal we expect our medical supplies expense to continue to increase in future periods as new technologies are introduced into the cardiovascular care market and as we continue to experience increased utilization of aicd and pacemaker procedures that use high cost devices 
the amount of increase in our medical supplies expense  and the relationship to net revenue  in future periods will depend on many factors such as the introduction  availability  cost and utilization of the specific new technology by physicians in providing patient care  as well as any changes in reimbursement amounts we may receive from medicare and other payors 
we also expect our medical supplies expense in future periods will remain sensitive to changes in case mix of procedures at our hospitals as surgical procedures typically involve higher cost medical supplies than catheterization procedures 
bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in bad debt expense was primarily incurred by our same facilities hospitals  which accounted for million of the increase 
our four new hospitals accounted for the remaining million increase for fiscal compared to fiscal the million increase in our same facility hospitals bad debt expense was primarily attributable to growth in net revenue  as previously discussed  and an increase in the number of self pay patients in several of our markets this fiscal year  including the impact of the continued ramp up of harlingen medical center which operates in a market with a historically higher percentage of self pay patients than our other hospitals 
as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal while payor mix has a significant impact on bad debt expense  we anticipate future bad debt expense levels as a percentage of revenue to approximate those recognized in fiscal other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase in other operating expense was due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by a million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
of the million increase in hospital division other operating expense  our four new hospitals accounted for million and our same facility hospitals accounted for the remaining million 
this increase in our same facility hospitals other operating expense was primarily attributable to the significant growth in volume at two of our hospitals 
these increases in other operating expenses were offset in part by decreases resulting from company wide cost control initiatives 
the million decrease in our diagnostics division was primarily attributable to reduced operating costs resulting from the dissolution of gaston cardiology services  llc  combined with company wide cost control initiatives 
the million decrease in our corporate and other division s other operating expense was primarily due to the change in the physician management contracts in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursed costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to higher same facility hospital net revenue and the certain economies of scale achieved on the fixed cost components of our other operating expenses combined with the benefits realized from our company wide cost control initiatives 

table of contents pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
upon opening heart hospital of lafayette during the second quarter of fiscal  we have completed our hospital expansion plans that commenced three years ago  and we do not currently have any other hospitals under development 
accordingly  we have not incurred any pre opening expenses since march the amount of pre opening expenses  if any  we many incur in future periods will depend on the nature  timing and size of our development activities 
depreciation 
depreciation increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in depreciation primarily occurred in our hospital division and was due to the depreciation of assets placed in service upon the opening of our four new hospitals  offset in part by a decrease related to equipment that became fully depreciated during fiscal in certain of our older same facility hospitals 
impairments of goodwill and long lived assets 
impairments were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the million impairment in represents the write off of an enterprise wide healthcare information system  while the million charge in represents goodwill impairment 
the million impairment in represents the unamortized costs associated with the acquisition  development and implementation of an information system that had been installed in two hospitals 
due to a number of functionality and integration issues experienced with the system  we determined that the system was not performing to its original specifications and thus will be replaced at the two hospitals where it has been installed and will not be installed in any additional hospitals as stated in the original license 
we are currently engaged in efforts to recoup costs associated with the impairment from the vendor 
at the end of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that we do not amortize goodwill  but rather subject our goodwill to an impairment test on an annual basis at september under our accounting policies  and between annual dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist 
the results of our test concluded our goodwill was impaired  and based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this million increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to interest expense at our four new hospitals of million  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense in our same facility hospitals due to a decrease in outstanding debt through scheduled principal payments and prepayment reductions 
in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of interest expense as part of the capitalized construction costs of our hospitals that were under development during fiscal and  respectively 
no interest expense was capitalized during the last two quarters of fiscal we expect our interest expense for fiscal to increase in comparison to fiscal due to the july  financing transaction  which resulted in an increase in our cost of borrowings compared to the debt that was repaid 
loss on debt refinancing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repaid approximately million of existing debt with proceeds received from our offering of million senior notes and a million senior credit facility 
the repayment of debt resulted in a loss of approximately million and included the write off of unamortized loan acquisition costs of approximately million  the recapture of other comprehensive loss under interest rate swaps of approximately million and prepayment penalties of approximately million 
equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates remained consistent at million for fiscal and fiscal however  the equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for the fiscal period includes million associated with a gain on sale of land by an unconsolidated affiliate of one of our hospitals 
excluding this gain  our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased approximately million from the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to a decline in the operating results of our unconsolidated affiliate hospital primarily due to the reduction in that hospital s capital cost reimbursement under the medicare program as the hospital transitioned to the full federal payment methodology following its second full year of operations on october  
table of contents minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to changes in the operating results of our individual hospitals and the respective basis for allocation of such earnings or losses among us and our partners on either a pro rata basis or disproportionate basis during fiscal compared to fiscal in general  our earnings allocated to minority interests increased due to a decrease in ramp up losses incurred by our new hospitals which were allocated to our minority partners on a pro rata basis combined with an increase in earnings of certain of our same facility hospitals which were allocated to our minority partners on a pro rata basis 
these additions to our earnings allocated to minority interests were increased in part by a change from pro rata to disproportionate recognition of losses at three of our new hospitals that continue to ramp up combined with a change from disproportionate recognition of losses to pro rata recognition of earnings at one of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to the prior year 
for a more complete discussion of our accounting for minority interests  including the basis for the disproportionate allocation accounting  see critical accounting policies 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit was million for fiscal compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal  which represented an effective tax rate of approximately and  respectively 
the company continues to have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards available from prior periods to offset the majority of its current tax liabilities 
for fiscal  income taxes include certain one time state incentive credits that we qualified for and were able to utilize 
for fiscal  our reported loss before income taxes of million included a million impairment of goodwill  which is non deductible on a permanent basis for tax purposes 
accordingly  our loss before income taxes that was subject to current and deferred taxes was only million  and we recognized income tax expense of million  which was comprised of million of current income tax expense offset by million of deferred income tax benefit during fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year statement of operations data

net revenue increased million  or  to million for our fiscal year ended september  from million for our fiscal year ended september  the million increase in net revenue resulted from a million increase generated by our hospital division  offset in part by a million decrease in our diagnostics division and a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue was primarily attributable to the opening of harlingen medical center on october  and the opening of louisiana heart hospital on february  harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital generated million of the million increase in our hospital division s net revenue during fiscal the million decrease in our diagnostic services division was primarily the result of the million of net revenue arising from management fees that we recognized in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the favorable settlement of the sun city cardiac center billing dispute 
excluding the effect of this favorable settlement  our diagnostics division generated a million increase in net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the increase in net revenue generated by new diagnostic and therapeutic facilities opened since fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in net revenue in our mobile cardiac catheterization laboratories and in one of our hospital based cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic facilities due to a decline in the number of procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal the million decrease in our corporate and other division s net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in our cardiology consulting and management operations and included a million decrease due to the expiration of a management contract during fiscal and a million decrease due to the restructuring of one of our two physician management contracts in the third quarter of fiscal the restructuring of the physician management contract during the third quarter of fiscal reduced management fee revenue but more significantly eliminated the cost reimbursement arrangement whereby we were previously reimbursed for costs on a pass through basis 
the change of the reimbursement terms of this contract reduced both net revenue and certain of our operating expenses by corresponding amounts and  therefore  had no impact on our consolidated loss from operations or our consolidated net loss for fiscal on a same facility basis in our hospital division  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for this million increase includes the impact of an additional million of net revenue that was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal by one of our hospitals as a result of a favorable settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider 
excluding this million of additional net revenue from the third quarter of fiscal  our hospital division s net revenue increased million 
this increase in net revenue was due to an increase in the number of procedures 
table of contents performed and an increase in billing rates in our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase in net revenue was achieved after the impact of a million reduction in our net revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting from an unanticipated change by one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries in their interpretation of how the capital cost reimbursement methodology should be applied at four of our hospitals 
on a same facility basis in our hospital division  admissions decreased and adjusted admissions declined 
these operating measures reflect the impact of events at two of our hospitals 
the first was lower patient volume at bakersfield heart hospital during the first six months of fiscal due to the transition associated with the reopening of the hospital s emergency department during the second quarter of fiscal the second was lower inpatient volumes and net revenue at tucson heart hospital during fiscal due to i an increase in emergency room capacity in the market by competitors  ii an increase in the number of patients using the hospital s outpatient services  iii an apparent reduction in the number of winter visitors in the market for healthcare  which we believe is related to the poor economy  and iv a mild flu season in the market 
on a same facility basis  excluding the impact of these two hospitals  admissions increased and adjusted admissions increased for fiscal compared to also on a same facility basis  inpatient catheterization procedures increased and inpatient surgical procedures increased for fiscal compared to fiscal average length of stay in our same facility hospitals decreased to days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal personnel expense 
personnel expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the million increase in personnel expense was primarily due to a million increase generated by our hospital division  which included a million increase attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining million increase in our same facility hospitals was primarily due to higher wage rates and benefit costs  offset in part by a decrease in the use of contract nurses in our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal and a decrease in staffing at one of our hospitals related to the decline in admissions and procedures performed in that hospital  primarily related to the closing of the emergency department  as previously discussed  during the first six months of fiscal the increase in the hospital division s personnel expense was offset in part by a decrease in our corporate and other division s personnel expense due to the change in the physician management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations whereby certain reimbursable costs are no longer being passed through our operations  as previously discussed 
as a percentage of net revenue  personnel expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  personnel expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal medical supplies expense 
medical supplies expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal of this million increase in medical supplies expense  our hospital division generated a million increase that included an increase of million attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining increase of million in our same facility hospitals was primarily due to a increase in surgical procedures and a increase in catheterization procedures performed during fiscal compared to fiscal combined with the increase in costs resulting from the introduction of drug eluting stents in april the increase in surgical procedures during included a significant increase in procedures that use higher cost medical devices and supplies  such as aicd and pacemaker procedures 
surgical procedures typically involve higher cost medical devices and supplies than catheterization procedures  and certain surgical procedures such as aicds and pacemaker procedures involve high cost devices  which makes our medical supplies expense sensitive to changes in case mix of procedures at each of our individual hospitals 
in addition  the introduction of drug eluting stents in april contributed to higher supply cost during the last five months of fiscal the remaining million increase in medical supplies expense was incurred by our diagnostics division and was primarily due to the net revenue growth in its operations  a change in procedure mix in one of our diagnostic centers  and the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents during fiscal under the agreements with our hospital customers where we operate cardiac diagnostic and therapeutic centers  we are typically able to pass 
table of contents through most of the increased costs associated with drug eluting stents 
as a percentage of net revenue  medical supplies expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  medical supplies expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal bad debt expense 
bad debt expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this million increase was primarily due to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in bad debt expense of our same facility hospitals due to the continued improvement in the receivables collection procedures and the decline in our hospital division s days of net revenue in accounts receivable 
our same facility hospitals days of net revenue in accounts receivable  based on fiscal year net revenue  was days as of september  compared to days as of september  we primarily attribute the decline in days of net revenue in accounts receivable and the decline in bad debt expense in our same facility hospitals to the receivables collection procedures and other processes we implemented in our business offices during fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  bad debt expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  bad debt expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal other operating expenses include primarily maintenance  rent  property taxes  insurance  utilities  advertising  travel  professional fees  contract services and support services provided to operating divisions by our corporate office 
of the million increase in other operating expenses  our hospital division generated a million increase and our diagnostics division generated a million increase  which was partially offset by a million decrease in our corporate and other division 
the million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses included a million increase attributable to the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital during fiscal the remaining million increase in our hospital division s other operating expenses was primarily due to an overall increase in our insurance costs  primarily medical malpractice insurance costs  including both premiums and self insured retention  of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase in the maintenance expense at some of our same facility hospitals 
the million increase in our diagnostic services division s other operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in insurance costs and net revenue growth in the division s operations  as previously discussed  offset in part by a decrease in legal expenses during fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in the diagnostics division s legal expenses was attributable to an unusually high amount of legal expenses incurred during fiscal relating to the sun city settlement 
the million decrease in other operating expenses of our corporate and other division was primarily due to the expiration of a management contract during fiscal and the change in a physician management contract in the third quarter of fiscal in our cardiology consulting and management operations  as previously discussed 
these decreases in other operating expenses were offset in part by increases resulting from severance costs recognized for certain of our previous executive officers  net of bonuses not paid  and costs associated with an offering of debt securities that we elected to delay during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the results of operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital from fiscal and excluding the million of net revenue and the million of legal expense resulting from the sun city settlement and the million of net revenue resulting from the settlement of a billing dispute with a managed care provider from fiscal  other operating expense represented of net revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal pre opening expenses represent expenses specifically related to projects under development  primarily new hospitals 
as of september   we had three hospitals under 
table of contents development the heart hospital of milwaukee  texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette 
we opened the heart hospital of milwaukee on october   texsan heart hospital on january  and heart hospital of lafayette on march  as of september   we had five hospitals under development 
depreciation 
depreciation increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in depreciation primarily occurred in our hospital division and was due to the depreciation of assets placed in service upon the opening of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  offset in part by a decrease related to equipment that became fully depreciated since fiscal at some of our older hospitals 
amortization 
amortization decreased approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the write off of other intangible assets in connection with the settlement and expiration of a management contract during fiscal and a change in the estimated useful life of certain intangible assets related to the change in the physician management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations during the third quarter of fiscal the decrease was also partially due to other intangible assets that became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of fiscal in our corporate and other division 
during fiscal  we recognized a million gain on the settlement of a management contract in our cardiology consulting and management operations that occurred in december this gain is included in gain on sale of property  equipment and other assets in our consolidated financial statements 
impairments of goodwill and long lived assets 
in september  we performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that we do not amortize goodwill  but rather subject our goodwill to an impairment test on an annual basis at september under our accounting policies  and between annual dates if an event occurs  or circumstances change  that indicate an impairment may exist 
the results of this test concluded our goodwill was impaired  and based on the hypothetical purchase price methodology required under sfas no 
 we determined the amount of the goodwill impairment to be approximately million at september  there was no such impairment in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase in interest expense was primarily due to the operations of harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  offset in part by a decrease in interest expense of our same facility hospitals resulting from a decrease in outstanding debt through scheduled principal payment reductions and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt during fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of interest expense as part of the capitalized construction costs of our hospitals under development  which was not included in interest expense recognized for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to the decline in interest rates and balance of our variable rate short term investments  which are included in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which was primarily due to improved operating results from our unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
we have only one hospital in which we hold less than a equity interest and over which we do not have substantive control  such that we were required to account for as an equity investment during fiscal and we also continue to hold a small number of additional equity investments in our diagnostic services division  our corporate and other division  and in one of our hospitals 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 
minority interest share of earnings of consolidated subsidiaries decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal excluding the effect of the million allocated to minority interests during fiscal resulting from the sun city settlement  earnings allocated to minority interests decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to the losses allocated to minority interest in harlingen medical center and louisiana heart hospital  losses allocated in our hospitals under development resulting from 
table of contents the increase in pre opening expenses at those hospitals  and a decline in the operating results of one of our same facility hospitals during fiscal compared to fiscal these decreases to minority interest were offset in part by an increase in minority interest in the earnings of one of our hospitals in which we recognized a disproportionate share of the profits during fiscal compared to our pro rata share during fiscal during fiscal  disproportionate recognition of losses in our hospitals had a negative impact of million on our reported loss before income taxes 
during fiscal  disproportionate recognition of earnings in our hospitals had a positive impact of million on our reported income from operations 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal for fiscal  our reported loss before income taxes of million included a million impairment of goodwill  which is non deductible on a permanent basis for tax purposes 
accordingly  our loss before income taxes that was subject to current and deferred taxes was only million  and we recognized income tax expense of million  which was comprised of million of current income tax expense offset by million of deferred income tax benefit during fiscal selected quarterly results of operations 
the following table sets forth quarterly consolidated operating results for each of our last five quarters 
we have prepared this information on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements and included all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
these quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
this information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

cardiovascular procedures can often be scheduled ahead of time  permitting some patients to choose to undergo the procedure at a time and location of their preference 
some of the types of trends that we have experienced in the past and may experience again in the future include the markets where some of our hospitals are located are susceptible to seasonal population changes with part time residents living in the area only during certain months of the year  
table of contents patients choosing to schedule procedures around significant dates  such as holidays  and physicians in the market where a hospital is located schedule vacation from their practice during the summer months of the year  around holidays and for various professional meetings held throughout the world during the year 
to the extent these types of events occur in the future  as in the past  we expect they will affect the quarterly results of operations of our hospitals 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow activities 
our consolidated working capital was million at september  and million at september  the increase of million in working capital resulted primarily from decreases in current portion of long term debt and accrued construction and developments costs combined with increases in accounts receivable  net  medical supplies and current deferred income tax assets  offset in part by a decrease cash and cash equivalents combined with increases in accounts payable  accrued compensation and benefits and other accrued liabilities 
a significant portion of our change in working capital was due to a decrease in current portion of long term debt during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the prepayment of certain debt instruments on july   which had current obligations of approximately million at september   with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes and a new credit facility see discussion below  which had current obligations of million at september  in addition during the first quarter of fiscal  we made a principal prepayment related to amended loan terms of the mortgage debt at bakersfield heart hospital of million  which had been classified as a current obligation at september  another significant portion of our change in working capital was due to the opening and subsequent operating activities of our four new hospitals  louisiana heart hospital  the milwaukee heart hospital  texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette and the continued ramp up of harlingen medical center 
consistent with the trend from september  to september   we expect our working capital to fluctuate as our new hospitals progress through the ramp up period 
as each new hospital neared its opening  working capital decreased as accounts payable and accrued liabilities increase  conversely  subsequent to the opening of each new hospital  working capital increased and continues to increase primarily as a result of increases in accounts receivable  net  from operating activities 
the increase in accounts receivable  net  was primarily attributable to the growth in our net revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal  including the ramp up of our four new hospitals and the growth in our same facility hospitals 
these increases in accounts receivable  net  were partially offset by estimated third party payor reimbursement settlements accrued during fiscal  including the outlier payments  as discussed below 
the increase in medical supplies inventory was primarily due to the ramp up of our four new hospitals and volume purchases of inventory at two of our same facility hospitals during the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in accrued construction and development costs resulted from the financing of equipment purchases that were accrued at september  with borrowings under equipment notes payable during fiscal at our four new hospitals 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in activity at texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette which opened during the second quarter of fiscal offset in part by the timing of our payment cycle at several of our same facility hospitals  which resulted in a decrease in unpaid vendor invoices as of september  compared to september  the increase in accrued compensation and benefits was primarily due to increases in staffing related to the ramp up of our four new hospitals as well as at several of our same facility hospitals in addition to higher accrued bonuses year over year 
the increase in other accrued liabilities was primarily due to an increase in activity at our four new hospitals and an increase in accrued interest expense offset in part by the payment of distributions to minority partners at one of our hospitals during fiscal that were declared but not paid and therefore accrued as of september  as discussed below  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to cash used in investing activities and financing activities partially offset by cash flows provided by operations 
in addition  our cash and 
table of contents cash equivalents at september  includes approximately million that we have received in outlier payments from one of our medicare intermediaries that we may have to repay to the medicare program upon final settlement of cost reports for the periods in question 
cms adopted a new rule governing the calculation of outlier payments during the third quarter of fiscal since the changes to the outlier formula became effective in august  we have recognized net revenue from outlier payments at estimated amounts determined under the new calculation formula 
however  one of our medicare fiscal intermediaries continued to pay us at amounts calculated under the historical formula since august effective may   the medicare fiscal intermediary began paying us at rates consistent with the new calculation formula for our medicare cost report year ending september   thus  we expect no future increase in the million received in outlier payments through april  we have reflected this million as a reduction to our accounts receivable  net  at september   consistent with our other estimated reimbursement settlements  and have not recognized the receipt of these outlier payments as net revenue in any affected period 
however  net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal and fiscal were positively impacted by million and million  respectively  for the payments received during these periods 
our cash and cash equivalents and our cash flows from operations may decrease in the future periods if we are required to repay the amounts upon filing our medicare cost reports 
our operating activities provided net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash of million for fiscal the million net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was the result of cash flow provided by our operations offset in part by the net changes in our working capital as discussed above 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily the result of cash flow provided by our operations combined with increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities offset in part by increases in accounts receivable  net  medical supplies and prepaid expenses and other current assets 
our investing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the million of net cash used by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to our capital expenditures during the period offset in part by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
the million of net cash used by investing activities for fiscal was also primarily due to our capital expenditures  related mostly to our hospitals under development and partially offset by a net decrease in investments in and advances to our unconsolidated affiliate hospital 
although we have completed our hospital expansion plans that commenced three years ago  and we do not currently have any other hospitals under development  we expect to continue to use cash in investing activities in future periods 
the amount will depend largely on the type and size of strategic investments we make in future periods 
our financing activities used net cash of million for fiscal compared to net cash provided of million for fiscal the million of net cash used by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of repayments of long term debt and capital lease obligations of million  advances and distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs  of million 
the million of net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was the result of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net of loan acquisition costs  of million  offset in part by repayments of short term borrowings  long term debt and capital lease obligations of million and advances and distributions to  net of investments by  minority partners of million 
capital expenditures 
expenditures for property and equipment for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively 
these capital expenditures included million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for our five most recently opened hospitals harlingen medical center  louisiana heart hospital  the milwaukee heart hospital  texsan heart hospital and heart hospital of lafayette 
in addition  we incurred million and million of capital lease obligations during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and we had accrued million of capital expenditures primarily related to new hospital development at september  we expect our capital expenditures will decrease for fiscal and future periods compared to fiscal as we opened our last hospital under development in march the amount of capital expenditures we incur in future periods will depend largely on the type and size of strategic investments we make in future periods 

table of contents obligations  commitments and availability of financing 
as described more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we had certain cash obligations at september   which are due as follows in thousands thereafter total long term debt obligations under capital leases total debt other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps interest on indebtedness operating leases total other long term obligations  excluding interest rate swaps  consists of non current portion of deferred compensation under nurse retention arrangements at two of our hospitals and a working capital note due to a hospital investor partner at one of our hospitals 
the working capital note obligation is due as funds are available and therefore is included in the thereafter category in the above table 
interest on indebtedness represents only fixed rate indebtedness 
on july   we completed our offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
in november  we completed an exchange of the unregistered senior notes for registered senior notes 
concurrent with our offering of the notes  we entered into a million senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks and other institutional lenders 
the new credit facility provides for a seven year term loan facility in the amount of million  all of which was drawn on july   and a five year senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million which includes a million sub limit for the issuance of stand by and commercial letters of credit and a million sub limit for swing line loans 
proceeds from these new debt facilities combined with cash on hand were used to repay million of the long term debt outstanding at that date 
at september   we had million of outstanding debt  million of which was classified as current 
of the outstanding debt  million was outstanding under our senior notes  million was outstanding under our new credit facility and million was outstanding to lenders to our hospitals 
the million outstanding to lenders to our hospitals included million borrowed under a million debt commitment to finance heart hospital of lafayette s equipment purchases and million outstanding under capital lease obligations 
the remaining million of debt was outstanding to lenders for diagnostic services under capital leases and other miscellaneous indebtedness  primarily equipment notes payable and capital leases 
no amounts were outstanding to lenders under our million revolving credit facility at september  at the same date  however  we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced our availability under this facility to million 
in addition to the million of outstanding debt at september   we had million of a working capital note due to a community hospital investor partner at one of our hospitals that will be repaid as funds are available and is included in other long term obligations 
covenants related to our long term debt restrict the payment of dividends and require the maintenance of specific financial ratios and amounts and periodic financial reporting 
at september   louisiana heart hospital was in violation of a certain financial ratio related to its equipment loan 
the equipment lender has granted a waiver for the breach at september  we were in compliance with all other covenants in the instruments governing our outstanding debt at september  except as noted above 
at september   we guaranteed either all or a portion of the obligations of our subsidiary hospitals for equipment and other notes payable 
we provide these guarantees in accordance with the related hospital 
table of contents operating agreements  and we receive a fee for providing these guarantees from the hospitals or the physician investors 
we also guarantee approximately of the real estate and of the equipment debt of avera heart hospital of south dakota  the one hospital in which we owned a minority interest at september   and therefore do not consolidate the hospital s results of operations and financial position 
we provide such guarantee in exchange for a fee from the hospital 
at september   avera heart hospital of south dakota was in compliance with all covenants in the instruments governing its debt 
the total amount of the affiliate hospital s real estate and equipment debt was approximately million and million  respectively  at september  accordingly  the real estate debt and the equipment debt guaranteed by us was approximately million and million  respectively  at september  see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of the terms  covenants and repayment schedule surrounding our debt 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and available borrowings under our new credit facility  together with the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering and borrowings available under equipment debt commitments will be sufficient to finance our business plan  capital expenditures and our working capital requirements for the next to months 
intercompany financing arrangements 
concurrent with our new financing  we provided secured real estate and equipment financings to our majority owned hospitals 
the aggregate amount of the intercompany real estate  equipment and working capital loans we provided at july  was million 
each intercompany real estate loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s real estate  building and equipment and certain other assets 
each intercompany real estate loan amortizes based on a year term  matures on june  and accrues interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany real estate loans at september  was 
each intercompany equipment loan is separately documented and secured with a lien on the borrowing hospital s equipment and certain other assets 
amounts borrowed under the intercompany equipment loans are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest over terms that range from to years 
the intercompany equipment loans accrue interest at fixed rates ranging from to or variable rates based on libor plus and applicable margin 
the weighted average interest rate for the intercompany equipment loans at september  was 
we receive a fee from the minority partners in the subsidiary hospitals as consideration for providing these intercompany real estate and equipment loans 
we also use intercompany financing arrangements to provide cash support to individual hospitals for their working capital and other corporate needs  including the needs of our new hospitals during the ramp up period and any periodic or ongoing needs of our other hospitals 
we provide these working capital loans pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements between our physician and hospital investor partners and us at each of our hospitals 
these intercompany loans are evidenced by promissory notes that establish borrowing limits and provide for a market rate of interest to be paid to us on outstanding balances 
these intercompany loans are subordinated to each hospital s mortgage and equipment debt outstanding  but are senior to our equity interests and our partners equity interest in the hospital venture and are secured  subject to the prior rights of the senior lenders  in each instance by a pledge of the borrowing hospital s accounts receivable 
also as part of our intercompany financing and cash management structure  we sweep cash from individual hospitals as amounts are available in excess of the individual hospital s working capital needs 
these funds are advanced pursuant to cash management agreements with the individual hospital that establish the terms of the advances and provide for a rate of interest to be paid consistent with the market rate earned by us on the investment of its funds 
these cash advances are due back to the individual hospital on demand and are subordinate to our equity investment in the hospital venture 
as of september  and september   we held million and million  respectively  of intercompany working capital notes  net of advances from our hospitals 
the increase of approximately million was primarily attributable to the funding of working capital at our new hospitals 
the 
table of contents aggregate amount of these intercompany working capital loans and cash advances outstanding fluctuates from time to time depending upon our hospitals needs for capital resources 
because these intercompany notes receivable and related interest income are eliminated with the corresponding notes payable and interest expense at our consolidating hospitals in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the amounts outstanding under these notes do not appear in our consolidated financial statements or accompanying notes 
information about the aggregate amount of these notes outstanding from time to time may be helpful  however  in understanding the amount of our total investment in our hospitals 
in addition  we believe investors and others will benefit from a greater understanding of the significance of the priority rights we have under these intercompany notes receivable to distributions of cash by our hospitals as funds are generated from future operations  a potential sale of a hospital  or other sources 
because these notes receivable are senior to the equity interests of medcath and our partners in each hospital  in the event of a sale of a hospital  the hospital would be required first to pay to us any balance outstanding under its intercompany note prior to distributing any of the net proceeds of the sale to any of the hospital s equity investors as a return on their investment based on their pro rata ownership interests 
also  appropriate payments to us to amortize principal balances outstanding and to pay interest due under these notes are generally made to us from a hospital s available cash flows prior to any pro rata distributions of a hospital s earnings to the equity investors in the hospitals 
on december   we completed the sale of certain assets of the heart hospital of milwaukee for million 
of the million in proceeds received  approximately million was used to repay the heart hospital of milwaukee s intercompany secured loans  thereby increasing our consolidated cash position on such date 
as part of the terms of the sale  we were required to close the hospital 
as such  we incurred costs associated with the closing of the hospital  in addition to costs associated with completing the sale and additional operating expenses 
as stipulated by the covenants of our senior credit facility  within days after the receipt of the net proceeds  we may identify a use of the proceeds for capital expenditures or other permitted investments  so long as such usage occurs within days of the date identified

reimbursement  legislative and regulatory changes legislative and regulatory action has resulted in continuing changes in reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs that will continue to limit payments we receive under these programs

inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages  such as the growing nationwide shortage of qualified nurses  occur in the marketplace
