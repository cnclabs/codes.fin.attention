business and industry overview ciber  inc and its subsidiaries provide information technology it system integration consulting and other it services primarily to governmental agencies  and fortune and middle market companies  across most major industries  from offices located throughout the united states and europe  as well as canada and india 
we provide our clients with a broad range of it services  including custom and package software development  maintenance  implementation and integration 
in addition  we also provide it staff supplementation services and  to a lesser extent  resell certain it hardware and software products 
our january acquisition of ecsoft significantly expanded our european operations  and as a result  effective january  we created a new reportable segment called european operations 
we now have three reportable segments  custom solutions  package solutions and european operations 
our custom solutions segment includes our united states based ciber branch offices that provide it project solutions and it professional staffing services in custom developed software environments 
our package solutions segment primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including enterprise resource planning erp and supply chain management software from software vendors such as peoplesoft  lawson  oracle and sap 
our european operations segment includes ciber solution partners operations based in the netherlands plus the recently acquired ecsoft operations and is comprised of our european operations in denmark  germany  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the united kingdom 
ciber europe provides a broad range of it consulting services that include application development  package implementation  systems integration and support services 
our european operations accounted for of our total revenue in  up from in we primarily provide consulting services under time and material or fixed price contracts 
the majority of our service revenue is recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
for fixed price contracts  which make up approximately of our services revenue  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion 
changes in our services revenue is primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and our average rate per hour 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and the utilization level of those consultants 
utilization for our consultants represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our custom solutions segment typically around to as compared to our package solutions and european operations segments typically around to 
we actively manage both the number of consultants we have and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on a billable assignment in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our overall average rate per hour is also influenced by the results of our fixed price engagements  which can vary 
our average hourly billing rates are higher in our package solutions segment typically around to per hour as compared to our custom solutions segment typically around to per hour and our european operations segment typically around to per hour 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products as well as commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross margins on product sales are typically to 
as a remarketer of certain it products  we recognize commission revenue net of product costs resulting in lower revenue and higher gross margin 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations and organizations in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technology change as well as changes in business requirements and practices of our clients have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
in addition  the current economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of many of our clients and prospective clients  and has negatively impacted their it spending 
as a result  competition for new engagements and pricing pressure has been strong 
we have responded to these challenging business conditions by closely monitoring the utilization of our billable personnel  through continuing evaluation of the size of our workforce and required office space and by managing our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
business combinations as part of our ongoing growth strategy  we intend to continue to selectively identify and pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach  service offerings and client base 
from to  we completed the following significant business combinations acquired company date consultants added goodwill added ecsoft group plc january million decision consultants  inc april million metamor industry solutions  inc october million ecsoft group plc 
now named ciber europe limited is incorporated under the laws of england and wales 
at the time of the acquisition  ecsoft had operations in denmark  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the united kingdom that provided information technology consulting services similar to services provided by ciber 
prior to the acquisition  ecsoft s shares were publicly traded on the london stock exchange 
we acquired ecsoft to significantly increase the size of our european operations  including adding to our european management team 
at the time of the acquisition  we expected ecsoft to add approximately million in annualized revenue 
decision consultants  inc dci was very similar to our existing custom solutions operations 
the majority of dci s revenue was from clients that were already ciber clients and most of dci s operations were in locations already served by ciber custom branch operations 
as a result  the primary asset acquired was the workforce that was in place  which is accounted for as part of goodwill 
like ciber  dci s consultants comprised an experienced technical workforce that we believed would help maintain and obtain business at both current and new clients 
dci also added depth to our executive and operations management team 
the acquisition allowed us to combine many of the dci offices with existing ciber offices to obtain economies of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of revenue 
also significant were the cost savings to be realized by combining redundant corporate back office functions 
dci added significantly to ciber s existing consultant base at ibm  ford and verizon  among others 
in addition  the acquisition gave us opportunities at some new strategic clients  however  such clients did not constitute a significant percentage of dci s revenue 
metamor industry solutions  inc metamor provided custom software development and it staffing for federal and state local government agencies 
by combining metamor with ciber s existing federal and state local government operations  we approximately doubled the size of our public sector business 
change in accounting for goodwill in in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is reviewed annually for impairment 
as a result  beginning january   our expense for amortization of intangible assets has decreased significantly 
intangible assets other than goodwill continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of total revenue years ended december  consulting services other revenue total revenue gross margin services gross margin other revenue gross margin total selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following table sets forth certain operating data for our reportable segments years ended december  in thousands services revenue custom solutions package solutions european operations eliminations percent of services revenue custom solutions package solutions european operations services gross margin custom solutions package solutions european operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in this represents a increase in consulting services revenue  as well as a increase in other revenue 
other revenue increased to million in from million in this resulted from an increase in demand for it products during custom solutions services revenue increased  package solutions services revenue increased and our european operations service revenue increased when compared to last year 
the revenue growth resulted primarily from our ecsoft and alphanet acquisitions  which closed in  plus the full year benefit of our dci acquisition 
combined  these acquisitions added approximately million in incremental revenue to additionally  we experienced a improvement in billable consultant utilization in compared to these increases were partially offset by a cut back in services from a large telecommunications client  which negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in our average number of billable consultants increased to approximately  in compared to approximately  in the increase in custom solutions service revenue during was due to an average net increase of approximately consultants 
the increase in service revenue is also attributable to an improvement in billable consultant utilization to in from in the increase in package solutions service revenue during the year ended december  was due to improved utilization levels to in from in and to a lesser extent  increased average billing rates 
these improvements in rates and utilization were partially offset by an average net decrease of approximately consultants period over period 
the increase in european operations service revenue was the result of our ecsoft acquisition completed in january  which added approximately billable consultants to our european operations segment 
in total  our gross margin percentage decreased to of revenue in from of in this decrease is due to lower gross margins on both service revenue as well as other revenue 
the decline in gross profit on services revenue was primarily due to pricing rate pressure in our custom solutions segment 
custom solutions gross margin on service revenue decreased basis points in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a lower average billing rate of per hour in compared to per hour in package solutions gross margin on service revenue increased basis points in compared to this increase was due to the significant increase in utilization levels year over year  as significant steps were taken to bring non billable time in line with current demand 
european operations gross margin on service revenue decreased to in from in the prior year due to the addition of ecsoft  which has lower margins than our historical european operations 
our gross margin percentage on other revenue decreased to in from in due to increased sales on lower margin computer hardware products 
low margin computer hardware product sales accounted for of other revenue in compared to in  with higher margin commission revenue accounting for the remainder 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  which is evidence of our continuing efforts to contain costs and leverage our existing infrastructure 
our rent and depreciation expense  combined was million less in than it was in the absolute increase in sg a costs resulted from the incremental sg a associated with the acquired operations of decision consultants in may of  ecsoft in january of and alphanet in june of amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in due to additional amortizable intangible assets resulting from recent acquisitions 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed 
in december  we completed a million sale of convertible senior subordinated debenture and paid off our outstanding borrowings under our bank line of credit 
interest expense increased  year over year due to the combination of increased borrowing under our line of credit to fund our acquisition of ecsoft in january as well as interest expense relating to the debentures 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in our effective tax rate has decreased in from the prior year  due to the current year tax benefits resulting from the closure of certain subsidiary operations 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenue increased to million in from million in this represents an increase in consulting services revenue  which was partially offset by a decrease in other revenue 
other revenue decreased to million in from million in due to decreased hardware sales 
custom solutions services revenue increased  package solutions services revenue decreased and our european operations service revenue increased when compared to the prior year 
the revenue growth compared to was attributed to the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of and the first half of year over year  our average number of billable consultants increased to approximately  in from approximately  in the increase in custom solutions service revenue during was due to an average net increase of approximately consultants from combined with an increase in utilization levels to in from in the decrease in package solutions service revenue in was due to a combination of an average net decrease of approximately consultants  combined with a decrease in average billing rates 
the increase in european operations service revenue during was the combined result of an average net increase of approximately consultants from as well as a increase in average billing rates to in from in in total  our gross margin percentage decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenue 
custom solutions gross margin on service revenue decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the addition of decision consultants  inc dci in  which had slightly lower margins than ciber s other custom solutions operations 
the remainder of the decrease was primarily due to a lower average billing rate of per hour in compared to per hour in package solutions gross margin on service revenue decreased basis points in compared to this decrease was due to lower utilization levels coupled with a decrease in average billing rates during european operations gross margin on service revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from in the prior year due to the addition of our aris uk operation in september which had lower gross margins than our historical ciber europe operations 
our gross margin percentage on other revenue increased to in from in due to decreased sales on lower margin computer hardware products 
low margin computer hardware product sales accounted for of other revenue in compared to in  with higher margin commission revenue accounting for the remainder 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  as we have made cost saving efforts to better align our sg a costs with our current revenue levels 
the cost saving initiatives began during the second half of and primarily included reduced personnel and facility costs 
a metric that demonstrates the positive impact of our overhead personnel cuts is the ratio of billable employees to overhead employees which increased to at december  from at december  in addition  we realized economies of scale with the acquisition of dci  as many of the acquired offices were combined with our existing offices 
in  we recorded million of severance costs and million of office closure costs that are included in sg a 
in connection with our reorganization of our digiterra and waterstone subsidiaries  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs related to certain executive management positions that were eliminated 
in addition  during we incurred expenses related to losses on excess office space that we had sub leased to other parties 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from million in  primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january  whereby we no longer amortize goodwill 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed under our line of credit 
interest expense increased in as we borrowed under our line of credit to fund our acquisition of metamor in october and again in may for our acquisition of dci 
our effective tax rate was compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate in is primarily due to the elimination of amortization expense relating to non deductible goodwill  offset in part by increased state and foreign taxes 
income tax expense also includes benefits of  in and million in related to adjusting our prior years estimated federal and state tax liabilities to actual amounts upon completion of our tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of historically  we have used our operating cash flow plus the sale of stock and periodic borrowings under our line of credit to finance our operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and the proceeds from our debenture offering will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and equivalents cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to primarily due to improved operating results being more than offset by decreased cash provided by working capital changes  primarily reduced accounts receivable collections 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
during  we used million of net cash for our ecsoft acquisition and million of net cash for our alphanet acquisition compared to million of net cash in for our acquisition of dci 
our cash used for purchases of investments decreased due to a decrease in investment activity during in addition to the fact that there was million included in purchases of investments in for the purchase of shares of ecsoft 
we acquired the remaining of ecsoft in january financing activities are primarily comprised of proceeds from our debenture offering  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock and borrowing repayments under our line of credit 
in we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures in a private placement offering 
in connection with the debenture offering  we used million of the proceeds for the purchase of treasury stock 
in total  we purchased million of treasury stock in compared to million in we borrowed on our line of credit to partially fund our acquisitions of ecsoft and alphanet during the year  and repaid our line of credit with a portion of the proceeds from our debenture offering 
during we also paid million for the cash settlement of a put option issued in connection with our acquisition of dci in in  we received net proceeds of million from a sale of stock to investors that was used to fund part of the dci acquisition consideration 
in connection with our acquisition of dci  we assumed million of dci debt  which we subsequently repaid 
total accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  due to our acquisitions  which added million of accounts receivable at the time of acquisition 
total accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso were days at december  and changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and our level of collection efforts 
many individual reasons are outside of our control 
as a result  our dso will normally fluctuate from period to period affecting our liquidity 
our cash balance at december  primarily results from the net proceeds from december sale of million of convertible senior subordinated debentures plus cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we used the net proceeds from the sale of debentures to repurchase million of our common stock as well as million to repay our outstanding line of credit balance 
at december   we had approximately million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries  most of which was acquired with the acquisition of ecsoft in january prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of approximately million of prepaid and other current assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of ecsoft as well as million for the current portion of capitalized debenture issuance costs 
other long term assets increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of million for the long term portion of capitalized debenture issuance costs 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million as of december  from million at december  this increase is due to a combination of million of compensation related liabilities acquired with ecsoft as well as the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at december   there were thirteen days of unpaid wages compared to twelve days at december  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when payment is made 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
the increase in accounts payable is due to acquisitions as well as additional hardware related payables at december while the increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities is primarily due to acquisitions 
our reserve for accrued lease costs decreased to million at december  from million at december this reserve results from office locations that are vacant or that we have subleased at a loss 
we made payments  including termination settlements  of approximately million in we recorded expense of approximately million in both and related to closure of certain offices 
primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions  we have assumed lease obligations for a number of facilities that are vacant 
as we continuously evaluate our office facility needs compared to our level of operations  we may incur future charges related to office consolidation 
in we continued the repurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of  shares remaining 
on february   our board of directors authorized an additional  shares for repurchase 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock 
convertible senior subordinated debentures on december   in a private placement we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures due to mature in december the debentures are general unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities 
interest is payable semi annually in arrears on june th and december th of each year  beginning june  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business days after any ten consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of debentures for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the debentures  if the debentures have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate transactions 
upon conversion  we will have the right to deliver  in lieu of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
from december   to but not including december   we may redeem any of the debentures if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 
beginning december   we may  by providing at least day notice to the holders  redeem any of the debentures at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
debenture holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on december    and or at any time prior to their maturity in the case of certain events  at a repurchase price of of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
bank line of credit we have a million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na that expires on august  the line of credit agreement is secured by ciber s tangible and intangible assets and is also guaranteed by ciber s domestic subsidiaries 
the interest rate charged on borrowings under the agreement ranges from the prime rate of interest prime less basis points to prime less basis points depending on ciber s pricing ratio and changes  as required  on the first day of each quarter 
ciber s pricing ratio is defined as the ratio of ciber s total funded indebtedness at the end of each quarter divided by ciber s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the prior four fiscal quarters then ended 
the terms of the credit agreement contain  among other provisions  specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and acquisition activity and prohibit the payment of any dividends 
the line of credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants including a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio of  a minimum fixed charged coverage ratio ebitdar to total fixed charges of  a maximum leverage ratio total funded indebtedness divided by ebitda of and a maximum asset coverage ratio total funded indebtedness divided by net domestic accounts receivable of 
we are required to satisfy the financial covenants at the end of each quarter 
certain elements of these ratios are defined below 
ebitdar represents net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  and rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
total fixed charges represents the sum of capital expenditures  plus interest expense plus rent payments  measured over the prior four quarters 
total funded indebtedness includes borrowings under our line of credit plus the face amount of any outstanding letter of credit 
ebitda represents net income plus interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  and amortization expense  measured over the prior four quarters 
as a result of our december sale of debentures  we repaid the outstanding balance under the line of credit and further borrowing under the line of credit has been suspended until an amendment to the line of credit is executed modifying certain terms and the financial covenants 
we expect to have an amendment completed during the first quarter of march acquisition of scb computer technology on march   we acquired scb computer technology  inc scb 
scb  based in memphis  tennessee  provided it services similar to ciber  including consulting  outsourcing and professional staffing  with a particular focus on federal and state government clients 
the acquisition of scb added approximately  consultants to our professional staff 
we expect scb to add approximately million of annualized revenue 
the total consideration paid by ciber for all of scb s outstanding shares is approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of ciber common stock valued at approximately million 
in addition  scb had certain debt obligations  totaling approximately million  which we have repaid shortly after closing of the acquisition 
we used a portion of the cash raised from our december convertible debenture offering to fund the cash portion of the purchase consideration and the repayment of scb s debt 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total our convertible senior subordinated debentures are due however  pursuant to their terms  they may be redeemed or converted to ciber common shares at various times prior to maturity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
includes operating leases for all office locations and office equipment 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
our consulting revenue and profitability are affected by the number of workdays in a quarter 
typically our billable hours are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time 
as a result  our operating income as a percentage of revenue is generally the lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  the collectibility of accounts receivable  acquisition accounting  the valuation of goodwill  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  income taxes  and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and fixed price contracts we recognize revenue as we perform services for our clients 
we primarily provide consulting services under time and material or fixed price contracts 
the majority of our service revenue is recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period we estimate and accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are actually billed the following month and any differences compared to estimates are accounted for 
the most common reason for differences between our accruals and actual bills relate to hour adjustments as time sheets are approved  late time sheets received  and rate changes 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
each contract has different terms  scope  deliverables and engagement complexities that require significant judgment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements and other costs  as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve a certain level of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our engagements 
also  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of cost overruns 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
our allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
acquisition accounting in connection with acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and legal and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
in particular  restructuring liabilities are subject to change as we complete our assessment of the acquired operations and finalize our integration plan 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our statement of operations 
valuation of other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions  and estimates 
in certain situations  where deemed necessary  we use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are to be amortized over the best estimate of their useful life 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have a number of different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be estimated 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we subsequently determine that we will realize more or less of our net deferred tax assets in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
factors that may affect future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
our profit margin  and therefore our profitability  is largely a function of the rates we charge for our services and the utilization rate or chargeability  of our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our consultants  we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer 
the rates we charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  competition  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors  pricing policies of our competitors  the use of globally sourced  lower cost service delivery capabilities by our competitors and our clients  and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including seasonal trends  primarily as a result of holidays and vacations  our ability to transition employees from completed assignments to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  and our ability to manage employee turnover 
we have implemented cost management programs to manage our costs  including personnel costs  support and other overhead costs 
some of our costs  like office rents  are fixed in the short term  which limits our ability to reduce costs in periods of declining revenue 
our current and future cost management initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain our margins as our level of revenue varies 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  such as the evolution of the internet  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace 
also  services  solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 
if our clients are not satisfied with our services  we may have exposure to liabilities  which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition as well as our ability to compete for future work 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the provisions we typically include in our contracts that are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the applications we develop may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions 
it is possible  because of the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
in addition  although we maintain professional liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
moreover  as a consulting firm  we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality services to retain and attract clients and employees 
as a result  claims made against our work may damage our reputation  which in turn  could impact our ability to compete for new work and negatively impact our revenue and profitability 
if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  our revenue and profitability may decline 
as an integral part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to expand by acquiring information technology businesses 
we regularly evaluate potential business combinations and aggressively pursue attractive transactions 
we may be unable to profitably manage businesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact our revenue  profitability and our financial condition 
acquisitions involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention from existing business activities  additional costs and delays from difficulties in the integration of the acquired business with our existing business activities  loss of significant clients acquired  loss of key management and technical personnel acquired  assumption of unanticipated legal or other financial liabilities  becoming significantly leveraged as a result of debt incurred to finance acquisitions  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  impairment charges for acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  that decline in value  and dilution to our earnings per share as a result of issuing shares of our stock to finance acquisitions 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 
historically  we have not always achieved the level of benefits that we expected from our acquisitions 
as a result of our acquisitions we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
acquired businesses may perform significantly worse than we had expected for a variety of reasons  including  decreased customer demand for a particular service offering or the loss of a significant customer  among others 
such factors could lead to a goodwill impairment charge 
during  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to write down the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate from time to time  on a selective basis  other strategic acquisitions if we believe they will help us obtain well trained  high quality employees  new service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that financing for acquisitions will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable 
we may issue shares of our common stock as part of the purchase price for some or all of these acquisitions 
future issuances of our common stock in connection with acquisitions also may dilute our earnings per share 
the continuation of the current economic downturn has negatively impacted our revenue  and future economic downturns may cause our revenue and profitability to decline 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by regional and global economic conditions 
as a result of the current difficult economic environment  some clients have cancelled  reduced or deferred expenditures for information technology products and services 
future deterioration of economic conditions could adversely affect our pricing and utilization rates  and therefore our revenue and profitability 
financial and operational risks of international operations could result in a decline in our revenue and profitability 
we expect to continue to expand our international operations 
our foreign operations accounted for of our revenue 
we now have offices in eight foreign countries canada  denmark  india  germany  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the united kingdom 
international operations could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and changing economic and political conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business  revenue  profitability and financial condition 
the following factors  among others  present risks that could have an adverse effect on us the costs and difficulties relating to managing geographically diverse operations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in  foreign business culture and practices  restrictions on the movement of cash  multiple  and possible overlapping or conflicting tax laws  the costs of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  operating losses incurred in certain countries and the non deductibility of those losses for tax purposes  and differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in legal  labor  political and economic conditions  as well as international trade regulations and restrictions  and tariffs 
the termination of a contract by a significant client could reduce our revenue and profitability or adversely affect our financial condition 
our five largest clients accounted for of our revenue in the various agencies of the federal government represent our largest client  accounting for of total revenue in  while no other customer accounted for more than our total revenue 
we strive to develop long term relationships with our clients 
most individual client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
our clients typically retain us on a non exclusive  engagement by engagement basis 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time 
under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of our services under such contract without penalty 
in addition  contracts with the federal government contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide the federal government with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
among other things  governments may terminate contracts  with short notice  for convenience and may cancel multi year contracts if funds become unavailable 
when contracts are terminated  our revenue may decline and if we are unable to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner  our profitability may decline 
in  approximately of our revenue was from public sector clients  including u 
s 
federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies 
often government spending programs are dependent upon the budgetary capability to support such programs 
many government budgets have been adversely impacted by the economic slowdown 
most all states must operate under a balanced budget 
as a result of such budget and deficit considerations  our existing and future revenues and profitability could be adversely affected by reduced government it spending 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from projects to implement packaged software developed by others  including peoplesoft  lawson  oracle  and sap 
our future success in the packaged software implementation business depends on the continuing viability of these companies and their ability to maintain market leadership 
for example  it is unclear whether peoplesoft will continue to maintain a strong market presence following the acquisition of jd edwards 
in addition  oracle has commenced a hostile tender offer of peoplesoft and has stated that if successful in acquiring peoplesoft  it may discontinue developing and selling or continue to sell and support peoplesoft software only for a limited time 
the uncertainty about oracle s intentions may cause customers of peoplesoft and jd edwards to defer or cancel software purchases  which could harm our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain a good relationship with these companies or that they will maintain their leadership positions in the software market 
if we do not accurately estimate the cost of a large engagement which is conducted on a fixed price basis our revenue and profitability may decline 
we estimate that approximately of our revenue is from engagements performed on a fixed price basis 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and cost is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
when proposing for and managing fixed price engagements  we rely on our estimates of costs for completing the project 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and professionals as we plan to apply them to the project 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts including delays caused by factors outside of our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable and may affect the amount of revenue reported in any period 
unfavorable government audits could require us to refund payments we have received  to forego anticipated revenue and could subject us to penalties and sanctions 
the government agencies we contract with generally have the authority to audit and review our contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the audit agency determines that we have improperly received reimbursement  we would be required to refund any such amount 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any such unfavorable determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for new work 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive industry that includes a large number of participants 
we believe that we currently compete principally with other it professional services firms  technology vendors and the internal information systems groups of our clients 
many of the companies that provide services in our markets have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our marketplace is experiencing rapid changes in its competitive landscape 
some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with better capitalized partners 
these changes may create more or larger and better capitalized competitors with enhanced abilities to compete for market share generally and our clients specifically  in some cases  through significant economic incentives to clients to secure contracts 
these competitors may also be better able to compete for skilled professionals by offering them large compensation incentives 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting the competitors profit margins 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  competition from new entrants into our markets 
as a result  we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with our existing or any new future competitors and our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our profitability may decline 
our profitability is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency 
growth places significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategy for growth  we may not be able to manage a significantly larger and or more diverse workforce  control our costs or improve our efficiency 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to train  retain  effectively manage and attract highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
employee turnover is generally high in the it services industry 
if our efforts in these areas are not successful  our costs may increase  our sales efforts may be hindered  and or our customer service may degrade 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is often significant competition for certain personnel in the it services industry 
from time to time  we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations  or with required specific expertise 
in addition  we believe that there are certain key employees within the organization  primarily in the senior management team  who are necessary for us to meet our objectives 
due to the competitive employment nature of our industry  there is a risk that we will not be able to retain these key employees 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued growth 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance  which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
if the accounting for employee stock options is changed  we may be forced to change our business practices 
under current accounting principles  we do not record expense for our employee stock options 
if the proposals to require recording of expense for employee stock options that are currently under consideration by accounting standards organizations are adopted  we may be required to change our business practices 
as a result  we could decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain employees and attract qualified candidates and could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay 
in addition  such a change in accounting would have a negative effect on our earnings 
our debt may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures due this significantly increased our aggregate level of indebtedness 
in the future  we may obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  which would have the effect of increasing total leverage 
we are not restricted under the terms of the debentures from incurring additional debt  including secured debt or repurchase of our securities 
in addition  the limited covenants applicable to the debentures do not require us to achieve or maintain any minimum financial results relating to our financial position or results of operations 
our ability to incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the debentures could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the debentures when due 
certain of our other debt instruments may  however  restrict these and other actions 
we also have a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in august we have used borrowings under our line of credit for consideration related to our acquisitions in  and in the past  we have been successful in generating cash flow from operations to reduce our indebtedness 
we have experienced  from time to time  instances of covenant non compliance under our line of credit  which non compliances have been waived by our lender 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit at december  the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because of the variable interest rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control  including those discussed herein 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of any indebtedness we may have 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness or maintain covenant compliance  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we may be unable to repurchase our outstanding debentures for cash on specific dates or following a designated event 
holders of our convertible senior subordinated debentures debentures have a right to require us to repurchase the debentures on specified dates or upon the occurrence of a designated event prior to maturity as described in the agreement 
any of our future debt agreements may contain a similar provision 
we may not have sufficient funds to make the required repurchase in cash at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  if we fail to repurchase the debenture as required by the indenture  it would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the debentures which  in turn  would be expected to constitute an event of default under any agreement relating to debt outstanding  including our bank line of credit 
important corporate events  such as takeovers  recapitalizations or similar transactions  may not constitute a designated event under the indenture governing the debentures and thus not permit the holders of the debentures to require us to repurchase or redeem the debentures 
conversion of the debentures will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of the debentures into ciber common shares will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders 
any significant sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures could also adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
our quarterly revenue  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter and other factors may result in increased volatility of our share price 
our quarterly revenue  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making them difficult to predict 
this may lead to volatility in our share price 
the changes in the market price of our common stock may also be for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 
some other factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  include the failure to be awarded a significant contract on which we have bid  the termination by a client of a material contract  announcement of new services by us or our competitors  announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors  changes in or failure to meet earnings estimates by securities analysts  sales of common stock by ciber or existing shareholders  or the perception that such sales may occur  adverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay liabilities  changes in management  general economic conditions and overall stock market volatility  and changes in or the application of us generally accepted accounting principles 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of ciber or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock  thus impacting the market price of our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the shareholders 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred stock purchase rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill that gives our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of ciber 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock  and as a result  the price of our common stock could decline 
the above factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of ciber  including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market for their shares of ciber common stock 
our chairman of the board owns sufficient shares of our common stock and can significantly affect the results of any shareholder vote regardless of the opposition of other shareholders or the desire of other shareholders to pursue an alternate course of action 
our chairman of the board of directors and founder  bobby g 
stevenson  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
stevenson has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of the board of directors  amendments to our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets or other major corporate transaction 
the interests of mr 
stevenson may differ from the interests of our other shareholders  and mr 
stevenson may be able to delay or prevent us from entering into transactions that would result in a change in control  including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market price for their shares 
these factors could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock  and as a result  the price of our common stock could decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made from our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rates 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the results of operations and balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during consolidation 
from time to time  ciber enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness  if any  under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate
