as the company continues to expand its international operations  exposures to gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
it has not been the company s practice to enter into foreign exchange contracts  but such contracts may be used in the future if the company deems them to be an appropriate resource to manage the company s exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
risk factors readers of this report should be aware that the following important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the actual operating results of the company and could cause the company s actual consolidated results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company the company s success depends on its ability to retain its existing clients and obtain new clients 
the company s clients generally may terminate the services it provides to them at any time 
the loss of one or more of the company s large clients or a significant reduction in business from such clients could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the existence of larger projects and long term client relationships may increase the company s reliance on particular projects and clients 
in  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by providing services to various us governmental departments and agencies 
in addition  revenues generated by the company s teleservices business segment were reliant upon certain key clients 
the loss of its larger clients would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents the company s business may suffer if demand for its services declines 
a number of factors that are beyond the company s control can adversely affect the demand of the company s existing clients for its services and impair its ability to attract new clients 
these include marketing budgets  general economic conditions  consolidations  government spending  and other industry specific trends 
changes in management or ownership of an existing client are factors that can affect the client s demand for the company s services 
as a result  the company may provide different levels of services to its clients from year to year  and these differences can contribute to fluctuations in the company s operating results 
the company s attempts to expand its operations into markets where the company does not currently operate may not be successful and the company s efforts to expand its international operations will be subject to added risks which are inherent in doing business abroad 
part of the company s business strategy is to expand domestically and internationally  and to extend into related businesses through strategic acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to so expand or to identify targets for such acquisitions on terms attractive to the company 
further  there can be no assurance that the company s services will be sufficiently accepted to sustain its efforts to expand in selected international markets 
international expansion will also subject the company to risks inherent in doing business abroad  including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates  limitations on asset transfers  changes in foreign regulations and political turmoil 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any subsequently acquired company with its current operations 
the company s business may suffer if the company is unable to retain its key personnel 
the company is dependent upon the efforts and skills of certain key senior executives 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company does not currently maintain key man life insurance policies on any of the company s executives other than john f 
short  the company s chief executive officer  and the company has employment agreements only with certain executive officers 
competition for senior management is intense  and the company may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining other personnel that the company may require in the future 
the company s operating results may suffer if there were significant goodwill write offs 
goodwill related to acquisitions represents a substantial portion of the company s total assets 
if the fair value of the goodwill should drop below the recorded value  the company would be required to write off the excess goodwill  which could adversely affect the company s operating results 
at december   the net goodwill amount on the company s consolidated balance sheet represents approximately of the company s total assets at such date 
this goodwill is an intangible asset and represents the excess of the purchase price that the company paid for acquired businesses over the estimated fair market value of the net assets of those businesses 
if the fair value of the goodwill  determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards  were to fall below the recorded value shown on the balance sheet  the company would be required to write off the excess goodwill 
any write off would be treated as an expense and  although non cash in nature  would adversely affect the company s operating results 

table of contents loan agreement covenants could adversely affect the company s business by limiting the company s flexibility 
the company is subject to customary financial and operating covenants under its current credit agreements 
these covenants limit or prohibit  among other things  the company s ability to incur additional debt  make prepayment of certain indebtedness  make investments  sell assets or engage in mergers and acquisitions 
these covenants could adversely affect the company s business by limiting the company s operational and financial flexibility 
the company faces competition in its industry 
the company faces competition in connection with most of the individual services and products it provides 
although the company believes that no single competitor offers a comparable combination of services and products  there can be no assurance that other companies  including some with greater financial resources than the company  will not attempt to offer a range of services and products similar to those offered by the company  or otherwise compete more effectively in the market research and information services industry 
the company regularly experiences significant competition for customers seeking market research services from a large number of competitors 
these include market research companies  advertising agencies  and business consulting firms 
the company competes for public sector research services with a large number of firms that vary in size as well as with not for profit organizations 
for outbound telemarketing services  the company competes with a large number of telemarketing companies 
the company s business may suffer from the enactment of state and federal government do not call lists 
such lists limit the number of eligible recipients of telemarketing phone calls 
although such lists do not currently apply to market research phone calls  new legislation could change the current market research exemption 
the company does not currently pay dividends on its common stock and the company does not expect to do so for the foreseeable future 
the company expects to retain its future earnings  if any  for the operation and expansion of its business  and to pay no cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
the terms of the company s current financing agreements prohibit the payment of dividends  and future agreements may also contain terms that limit the amount of dividends the company may pay or prohibit any payment of dividends 
anti takeover provisions and the company s right to issue preferred stock could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult 
the company s certificate of incorporation provides that the board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  the company s by laws provide for a classified board  with each board member serving a three year term 
the board of directors has also adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the issuance of preferred stock  the existence of a classified board  and the stockholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without board approval 
these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the company s common stock 

table of contents trading volume in the company s common stock has historically been limited 
there is a limited market for the company s common stock 
selling the company s shares may be difficult because smaller quantities of shares are bought and sold and security analysts and the news media s coverage about the company is limited 
these factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for the company s shares
