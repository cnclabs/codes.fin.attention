however  as originally disclosed in the outlook provided in our third quarter of earnings release  we experienced a market share loss in  in comparison to  and pricing pressure intensified resulting in lower revenue and profits in the fsi segment 
for the year ended december   we had a fsi market share 
even as we continue to regain market share in  the intense competitive pricing pressure in the traditional cooperative fsi industry will still impact revenue and earnings during  we continued our strategy to grow our customer base

our growth in our rop  cluster targeted and to product segments contributed to this broadening customer base 
the february acquisition of nch  with operations in the united states  mexico and europe  has expanded our product portfolio to include promotion information management products and coupon clearing services 
we continue to focus on nch s core expertise of managing the financial transactions between retailers and consumer packaged goods manufacturers related to their promotional activities

the cooperative fsi industry continues to show unit growth

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and estimates addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
for additional information see note  significant accounting policies  of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  valassis does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets historically have been reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
