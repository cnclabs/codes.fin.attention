overview we own and operate the alton belle casino in alton  illinois  the empress casino joliet in joliet  illinois  the argosy casino in riverside  missouri  the argosy casino in baton rouge  louisiana  the argosy casino in sioux city  iowa  and the argosy casino in lawrenceburg  indiana 
in  we invested capital to enhance our product offering and expand our capacity in our products 
in february  we completed an approximately million renovation in sioux city which helped lead to an increase in net revenues of for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  in may  we opened an approximately million barge based facility in joliet 
in spite of this investment  joliet net revenues decreased in due to the increase in gaming taxes in the state of illinois and the subsequent operating measures taken by the company as described below 
we opened our approximately million casino facility in riverside on december  we also continue to invest in cashless or tito slot machines  which  when implemented  are more convenient to our customers and result in operational efficiencies 
as of december   approximately of our total slot machines are tito capable and approximately of our total slot machines are tito operational 
we believe that going forward the convenience and efficiency of tito machines will have a positive impact on our casino revenues as well as on operating expenses 
pending final regulatory approvals  we expect to be substantially tito operational in in  our income from operations declined  or million  and our operating margins declined from to as compared to this decline was primarily the result of higher state gaming and admission taxes of million  including a million charge in indiana for legislation effective in and retroactive to our effective gaming and admission tax rates as a percent of net revenues for and were and  respectively 
also negatively affecting our operating results was the construction disruption at our riverside facility  an increase in corporate costs and an increase in our lawrenceburg city development fee with the increased revenues at our lawrenceburg facility 
we were able to offset some of these increased costs by implementing considerable operating savings in labor and promotional costs in response to the higher tax environment for our two illinois casinos 
we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted in as we absorb the full year impact of the illinois gaming tax increase 
effective july   illinois enacted new legislation increasing gaming and admission tax rates 
following passage of this new legislation  we wrote down  in the second quarter  million in barge assets previously held for future development at our joliet facility 
in addition  in an effort to minimize the impact of these tax increases  our joliet and alton properties  in august  implemented a reduction in hours of operation of both casinos and the restaurants  changes in product mix and significant revisions to certain marketing programs and joliet implemented an admission fee 
in june  indiana enacted legislation regarding the calculation of the indiana gaming tax rate increase  resulting in a million charge at our indiana facility 
in illinois  the increased taxes and dockside gaming in indiana have continued to negatively impact our illinois casinos 
in  many factors affected our casinos operations 
effective august   our lawrenceburg casino commenced dockside gaming 
this had a positive impact on casino revenues in the last half of during the second quarter  illinois and indiana enacted legislation increasing gaming tax rates 
also  in late and  three competitors made significant renovations  which  coupled with the increased gaming tax rates  negatively impacted our alton and joliet  illinois casino operations 
in addition  dockside gaming in indiana  effective august  negatively impacted our joliet  illinois casino operations 
in february  we refinanced a portion of our existing indebtedness with net proceeds from the issuance of million in new senior subordinated notes due  together with funds from our credit facility 
these funds were used to repurchase million  approximately  of our senior subordinated notes due we intend to call the remaining million of senior subordinated notes in june and will incur approximately million in premiums 
associated with this refinancing  we will incur a pretax charge in the first quarter of of approximately million consisting of financing fees and premiums 
legislative uncertainties present challenges and risks to our ongoing operations 
for example  casino gaming is currently prohibited or restricted in several states adjacent to indiana  iowa and missouri  and residents of those states comprise a significant portion of the patrons at our lawrenceburg  sioux city and riverside casinos 
legislation has been proposed in kansas  ohio and kentucky that would permit certain types of casino style gaming and  as a result  increase competition with respect to significant portions of our target markets 
furthermore  the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits make it more likely that those governments that permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes 
to address these legislative risks  we must regularly adjust our business strategies and adapt our casino operations 
casino and net revenues years ended december  in thousands casino revenues alton belle casino argosy casino riverside argosy casino baton rouge argosy casino sioux city argosy casino lawrenceburg empress casino joliet total net revenues alton belle casino argosy casino riverside argosy casino baton rouge argosy casino sioux city argosy casino lawrenceburg empress casino joliet total reconciliation of income from operations to ebitda year ended december  income loss from operations depreciation and amortization expense ebitda in thousands alton belle casino argosy casino riverside argosy casino baton rouge argosy casino sioux city argosy casino lawrenceburg empress casino joliet corporate total year ended december  alton belle casino argosy casino riverside argosy casino baton rouge argosy casino sioux city argosy casino lawrenceburg empress casino joliet corporate total year ended december  alton belle casino argosy casino riverside argosy casino baton rouge argosy casino sioux city argosy casino lawrenceburg empress casino joliet corporate total amounts for reflect five months of operations after our purchase of the empress casino joliet on july  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes it is a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry  a principal basis for valuation of gaming companies and is used as a basis for determining compliance with our credit facility 
management uses property level ebitda ebitda before corporate expense and ebitda margin ebitda as a percent of net revenues as the primary measures of our properties performance  including the evaluation of operating personnel 
ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income  as an indicator of our operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity  or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments  taxes and debt principal repayments  which are not reflected in ebitda 
we believe the performance of our operating units is more appropriately measured before these expenses  since the allocation of our capital is decided by corporate management and is subject to the approval of the board of directors 
in addition  we manage cash and finance our operations at the consolidated level and we file a consolidated income tax return 
we do not consider ebitda in isolation 
our calculation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
for a further discussion of such limitations  see our additional disclosures under our non gaap financial measures 
joliet amounts include a million write down of assets recorded in the second quarter related to assets previously held for future development 
because we do not include corporate expense in our computation  property level ebitda does not reflect all the costs of operating the properties as if each were a stand alone business unit 
corporate expense includes significant expenses necessary to manage a multiple casino operation  certain of which  such as corporate executive compensation  development  public company reporting  treasury  accounting  legal and tax expenses  would also be required of a typical stand alone casino 
the year ended december   includes a million pretax charge related to the abandonment of a proposed casino in kenosha  wisconsin 
income from operations and ebitda exclude consideration of any management fee paid to us and the minority interest in our lawrenceburg casino for periods prior to our first quarter acquisitions of these minority interests 
the lawrenceburg partnership paid a financial advisory fee equal to of its ebitda to a minority partner prior to our acquisition of this minority interest in february year ended december   compared to year ended december  casino revenues casino revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  components of this net increase are as follows lawrenceburg casino revenues increased million  or  to million from million reflecting the commencement of dockside gaming effective august  and revisions to our marketing programs 
sioux city casino revenues increased million  or  to million from million and baton rouge casino revenues increased million  or  to million from million 
both properties underwent recent renovations  sioux city in the first quarter and baton rouge in the third quarter  which have positively impacted these properties 
alton s casino revenues decreased million  or  to million compared to million as increased competitive pressures in the st 
louis market and the implementation of reduced hours commencing in august in response to illinois tax legislation have negatively impacted our results 
joliet casino revenues decreased million  or  to million from million 
joliet s casino revenues in had been negatively affected due to facility renovations by two competitors in and the commencement of dockside gaming in indiana in august when our new barge based casino opened in may  our net revenues increased  however  since the implementation of reduced hours of operations  the implementation of an admission fee and changes in marketing efforts commencing in august in response to illinois tax legislation increasing gaming and admission tax rates effective july our net revenues were down approximately september through december from levels 
riverside s casino revenues decreased million  or  to million from million due primarily to construction disruption during most of related to our renovation project that opened december  admissions admissions revenues net of complimentary admissions increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the entire increase of million is at our joliet facility as we began charging admission in august as a result of increased gaming and admission tax rates legislated by the state of illinois effective july 
lawrenceburg s net admissions revenues were million in and food  beverage and other food  beverage and other revenues remained constant at million for the years ended december  and december  food  beverage and other net profit increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  joliet s food  beverage and other net profit increased million which was offset by a decrease in net profit at riverside of million due to construction disruption during our renovation 
promotional allowances promotional allowances for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
included in this increase is million in complimentary admissions at joliet since implementation of an admission fee in august joliet s overall promotional allowances including the admissions allowance increase increased million as we also increased our promotional spending at our joliet facility prior to the opening of our new barge based casino in may as well as in reaction to increased competitive pressures in the first part of the year 
since august  in response to the gaming tax increase  we have significantly decreased promotional activity in joliet 
lawrenceburg s promotional allowances increased million across all lines of complimentary programs due to changes in marketing programs and overall increases in casino revenues 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in promotional spending at riverside due to the construction disruptions during our renovation project 
gaming and admission taxes gaming and admission taxes increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  an increase in the illinois tax rates effective july   and the full year impact of rate increases effective july  increased our annual effective tax rates at both our illinois casinos 
although casino revenues were down million at alton and million at joliet for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   gaming and admission taxes increased a combined million at these properties due to the increased tax rates in illinois 
the remaining portion of this increase is due primarily to increased gaming and admission taxes of million at our lawrenceburg casino 
this includes a million charge due to new legislation in june amending the calculation of the increase in indiana gaming taxes 
the remaining increase in gaming taxes at lawrenceburg is due to an increase in the gaming tax rates and increased casino revenues 
casino expenses casino expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  joliet and alton s casino expenses decreased million and million  respectively  as we have reduced payroll and other casino operating expenses corresponding with changes in operations in response to the increase in gaming and admission tax rates effective july   in illinois 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the factors contributing to this increase are primarily a million increase in city development fees at lawrenceburg corresponding to the increase in revenues related to the commencement of dockside gaming effective august   a million increase in advertising and promotions expense at joliet to promote the opening in may of our new barge based casino as well as in reaction to increased competitive pressures in the first half of the year  a million increase in advertising and promotions expense at riverside to promote the opening of our new casino on december   and an additional million of expenses related to our development efforts 
other operating expenses other operating expenses remained relatively constant at million and million for the year ended december   and the year ended december   respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to accelerated depreciation on planned asset retirements  depreciation for our new data warehouse placed in service during the third quarter and depreciation on our expanded asset base at our sioux city  joliet and riverside facilities 
write down of assets as a result of the increased gaming and admission tax rates enacted by the state of illinois  which were effective july   we have decided not to further develop additional barge platforms under construction for our expansion project initially planned at our joliet facility 
therefore  during the year ended december   we recorded a million write down of these barge platforms to their estimated net realizable value 
interest expense net interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced borrowings on our revolving line of credit due to debt repayments with free cash flow and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
we capitalized million of interest related to our casino construction projects for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  income tax expense income tax expense decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to reduced pretax earnings offset by an increase in our effective tax rate from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  this increase in our overall effective income tax rate is primarily due to the impact on our estimated annual income tax expense of gaming tax legislation enacted by illinois and indiana during june our net income decreased approximately per diluted share due to the change in the effective income tax rate 
net income net income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to the factors discussed above 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  casino revenues casino revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million 
components of this increase are as follows lawrenceburg casino revenues increased million  or  to million reflecting the commencement of dockside gaming on august  the empress casino joliet recorded million of casino revenue for the year ended december   compared to million in casino revenue for the five months since acquisition july  through december  the competitive impact of dockside gaming in indiana and facility renovations by two nearby casinos resulted in a decrease in joliet s casino revenues of million  from the million for the five months ended december   to million for the five months ended december  alton  riverside  sioux city and baton rouge casino revenues remained relatively constant  decreasing from million to million 
increased competitive pressures due to an expanded facility by a competitor in august affected our alton casino 
admissions admissions revenues net of complimentary admissions decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this reduction is due primarily to a reduction in the admissions price during at lawrenceburg 
food  beverage and other food  beverage and other revenues increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  joliet contributed million of this increase in food  beverage and other revenue 
food  beverage and other net profit improved million to million for the year ended december  of the increase  joliet and baton rouge including hotel operations contributed million and million  respectively  of this net profit 
promotional allowances promotional allowances for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the majority of this increase  million  is at our joliet facility 
we purchased joliet on july   and thus had a full year of promotional allowances for compared to five months for gaming and admission taxes gaming and admission taxes increased million  or  to million in lawrenceburg s gaming and admission taxes increased million due to increases in casino revenue with dockside gaming and an increase in gaming tax rates 
joliet s gaming and admission taxes increased million in  as includes only five months of operations since our acquisition on july  and includes an increase in gaming and admission tax rates 
for the five months ended december   compared to the five months ended december   for joliet since acquisition on july  gaming and admission taxes increased million although casino revenues decreased million 
based on casino revenues  our gaming and admission tax expense would have been approximately million lower in without the changes in gaming tax rates 
casino expenses casino expense increased million to million for the year ended december  joliet incurred million in casino expenses for the year ended december   and million for the five months of operations from our acquisition through december   an million increase 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   due primarily to a million increase in joliet s expenses to million for the year ended december   from million for the five months ended december  the remaining increase is due primarily to an increase of million in city development fees in lawrenceburg due to the increase in revenues related to the commencement of dockside gaming effective august  other operating expenses other operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  joliet incurred million for the year ended december  and million for the five months ended december  other operating expenses in include a charge of million relating to the abandonment of the proposed kenosha casino development 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  joliet s expense increased million from million for the five months ended december   to million for the year ended december  depreciation expense also increased due to accelerated depreciation of million on planned asset retirements and million on our new data warehouse placed in service during the third quarter these increases are offset by no longer amortizing goodwill in in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  if sfas had been in effect january   pretax goodwill amortization of million would not have been recorded for the year ended december  all goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually 
based on our evaluations performed during  we have no impairment to record 
interest expense net interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to additional borrowings in connection with the lawrenceburg and joliet acquisitions 
minority interests we had no minority interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to our lawrenceburg casino minority interest acquisitions during the first quarter of as the sole owner  we no longer incur minority interest expense 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december   compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december   due to increased pretax earnings and an increase in our effective corporate income tax rate due to an increase in indiana tax rates 
net income net income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to the factors discussed above 
if sfas had been in effect january   our net income would have increased by million to million and our diluted net income per share would have increased by to for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during  we generated cash flows from operating activities of million compared to million for this decrease is attributable to our decrease in operating income due to increased gaming and admission tax expense offset by increased cash flows from working capital items 
during  we used cash flows for investing activities of million versus million for during  our investing activities included million for purchases of property and equipment  a million increase over our property and equipment purchases in this increase is due primarily to construction and expansion projects at our joliet  sioux city and riverside facilities 
capital expenditures in and  respectively  consisted of million and million in maintenance capital and million and million in project capital  primarily for the expansion projects mentioned above 
during  we used million in cash flows from financing activities compared to million in cash flows used from financing activities in during and  we paid down million and million  respectively  on our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million outstanding on our senior secured credit facility million on our revolving credit facility and million on our term loan and million of subordinated notes due in june and september  including million of unamortized premium 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million 
as of march   subject to the limitations imposed by our debt incurrence covenant  availability under the credit facility was approximately million 
during  we entered into the first and second amendments to our second amended and restated credit agreement dated july  these amendments modified certain capital expenditure limitations and financial ratios while maintaining our available line of credit and our term loan 
the subordinated notes and credit facility contain certain restrictions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and the occurrence of additional indebtedness  as well as other typical debt covenants 
in addition  the credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios as follows total funded debt to ebitda ratio of a maximum of to  senior leverage ratio of a maximum of to  and fixed charge ratio of a minimum of to as of december   we are in compliance with these ratios 
in february  we refinanced a portion of our existing indebtedness with net proceeds from the issuance of million in new senior subordinated notes due  together with funds from our credit facility 
these funds were used to repurchase million  approximately  of our senior subordinated notes due related to this refinancing  we paid approximately million in premiums 
we intend to call the remaining million of senior subordinated notes during june with a call premium of approximately million 
funding of this debt purchase and call premium will be from funds available under our credit facility 
we have made capital investments at our existing properties for expansion and product enhancement 
in  we spent million on our approximately million renovation of our riverside facility excluding million in payables at december   million on a new barge based casino for our joliet property to complete our approximately million project and million for renovations at our sioux city facility to complete our approximately million project 
we opened our new facilities in riverside and joliet in december and may  respectively 
in  we expect maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of new cashless gaming product and facility enhancements to be approximately million 
given our significant cash generation capabilities  we seek investment opportunities at our existing properties or into new assets 
in addition  we may from time to time seek to retire certain of our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
during may  we announced board of directors approval of a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
the repurchases can be made at management s discretion without prior notice from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated third party transactions in compliance with applicable laws and depending on market conditions 
as of march   we have made no stock repurchases under this program 
consistent with gaming industry practice  we conduct our operations with a net working capital deficit 
unlike traditional industrial companies  a gaming company s balance sheet has limited accounts receivable and inventories 
in addition  casinos generate significant cash on a daily basis 
we generally apply our daily cash flows to pay down indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and pay our current liabilities pursuant to their normal cycles 
given the significant daily cash flows generated by our operations and the financial flexibility provided by our credit facility  the existence of a working capital deficit has no impact on our ability to operate our business or meet our obligations as they become due 
we believe that cash on hand  operating cash flows and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating  capital expenditure and debt service obligations for the next months 
contractual obligations  as of december   mature as follows one year and less years years after years total debt operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees  subordinated retained interest  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks  contingent liabilities or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
of our accounting estimates  we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill we have approximately million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at december  we regularly evaluate our acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
additionally  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   that requires us to perform impairment testing at least annually 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on  among other things  the regulatory and competitive status and operational performance of each of our acquired businesses 
future events  such as the statutory rollback of the illinois gaming tax rate in july and the enactment of increased gaming or admission tax rates  could significantly impact our judgments and any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment our operations are capital intensive and we make capital investments in each of our properties in the form of maintenance capital and  from time to time  expansion and product enhancement capital 
at december   we have approximately million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet 
we depreciate our assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events  such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
insurance accruals our insurance policies for employee health  workers compensation and general patron liability have significant deductible levels on an individual claim basis 
we accrue a liability for known workers compensation and general patron liability based upon claims reserves established by the third party administrator processing our claims 
additionally  we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors 
our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor 
these accruals involve complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels 
management reviews our insurance accruals for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
effective gaming tax rates the states of illinois and indiana assess gaming taxes on a graduated scale based on casino revenues 
in these states  we record gaming taxes based upon effective gaming tax rates for each of our casinos 
these effective rates are based upon statutory gaming tax rates and estimates of annual casino revenues 
increases or decreases in our actual or estimated casino revenues or changes in statutory gaming tax rates could require changes to our effective gaming tax rates 
management reviews our effective gaming tax rates at the end of each reporting period 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in several states 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas statement  accounting for income taxes 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent on our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates  we adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the examination issues are settled 
we have received proposed assessments from the indiana department of revenue idr in connection with our indiana income tax returns for the years through those assessments are based on the idr s position that state gaming taxes are based on gaming revenues and are not deductible for indiana income tax purposes 
we have filed a formal protest of the proposed assessment with the idr 
additionally  another company and the idr have litigated this matter in indiana tax court during the court has yet to issue an opinion in this case 
at december   we have accrued approximately million  net of federal tax benefit  for the proposed idr assessments including amounts for additional pending assessments for the years and for the year ended december   we expensed million related to this issue 
we continue to review the facts and circumstances leading to our determination of the probability the idr will prevail in their proposed assessments 
should our evaluation of the idr prevailing in their position change  we could discontinue accrual for future income taxes based upon the idr position and could reverse some or all of the current accrual of approximately million 
non gaap financial measures ebitda is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity 
ebitda represents income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
our compensation plans base incentive compensation payments in part on ebitda performance measured against targets  and we use it to establish our budgets and analyze our operations as compared to our budgets 
in addition  our credit facility and our indentures use measures similar to ebitda with additional adjustments to measure our compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
we believe ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
we also present ebitda because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of the operating performance of companies in the gaming industry  the vast majority of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
in addition  in evaluating ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those used in calculating ebitda 
our presentation of ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  it does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  it is not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows  it does not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  as discussed in our presentation of ebitda and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
property level ebitda represents ebitda attributable to a particular casino property before corporate expense 
we present property level ebitda as a further supplemental measure of the performance of our casino properties 
management uses property level ebitda as the primary measure of our properties performance  including the evaluation of operating personnel at our properties 
we also use property level ebitda to make decisions regarding the allocation of capital among our properties 
these decisions are made primarily by corporate management and our board of directors 
we believe that property level performance is appropriately measured before expenses such as interest and income taxes and other non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  because we finance our operations at the consolidated level and file a consolidated tax return 
as an analytical tool  property level ebitda is subject to similar limitations as ebitda 
in addition  because we do not include corporate expense in our computation  property level ebitda does not reflect all the costs of operating the properties as if each were a stand alone business unit 
corporate expense includes significant expenses necessary to manage a multiple casino operation  certain of which  such as corporate executive compensation  development  public reporting  treasury  accounting  legal and tax expenses  would also be required of a typical stand alone casino property
