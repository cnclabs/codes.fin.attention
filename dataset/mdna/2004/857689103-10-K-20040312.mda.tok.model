food and beverage 
food and beverage revenues were essentially flat for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  food covers increased while the average guest check decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in the average guest check was a result of selected menu price reductions  primarily in the buffet  which were implemented as part of a new marketing program 
the lower prices  as well as an aggressive marketing campaign promoting the buffet  drove additional volume resulting in an increase in food covers 
as a result of the additional volume  food and beverage expenses increased over the same period 
food and beverage costs also increased due to increases in selected food cost items and marketing costs promoting the buffet

other operating expenses decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year

sg a expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses is a result of an aggressive cost containment program in addition to taking advantage of economies of scale in terms of marketing  purchasing power  advertising and promotions  which was offset somewhat by an increase in energy costs 
corporate expense 
corporate expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  corporate expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to additional employer taxes on stock option exercises in of approximately million 
corporate expense as a percentage of net revenues increased to in the year ended december  as compared to in the year ended december  a large portion of these corporate expenses are fixed  which causes an increase in the percentage of net revenues as revenues decline

also included in development expense for the year ended december   is approximately million of costs related to the graton rancheria project  which were made after achieving certain milestones on the project and are also not reimbursable see future development 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased slightly by to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to capital spent in and the addition of new restaurants at santa fe station and fiesta henderson during  which was partially offset by a portion of the original equipment at texas station and sunset station having been fully depreciated during depreciation and amortization increased in the year ended december  to million as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to capital spent throughout  which included the retheming of the reserve to a fiesta branded property  the completion of the expansion project at santa fe station and the purchase of new slot machines and a new slot system 
this increase was offset partially due to a portion of the original equipment at texas station and sunset station having been fully depreciated during impairment loss 
we recorded an impairment loss of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  to adjust the carrying value of our goodwill and other assets to their estimated fair value 
the million impairment loss in related to the write off of approximately million in goodwill at fiesta rancho in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of reduced growth assumptions see change in accounting principle 
the remaining million impairment loss in was primarily related to the write off of our investment in a new slot product development 
the impairment of this asset was based upon our decision to no longer pursue the development of certain slot products 
as a result  all of the development costs that we had incurred were written off  as they were deemed to have no value 
during the year ended december   approximately million of the impairment loss related to the write down of certain assets related to our investments in an internet  intra state gaming platform and related technology 
in may  the nevada gaming commission communicated that it had general concerns regarding the security and reliability of internet gaming platforms 
the impairment of these assets was based upon our decision to no longer pursue nevada based internet gaming activities as a result of the uncertainty of regulatory approval of these types of activities 
as a result  all of the hardware  software and internal development costs that we had incurred were written off in  as they were deemed to have no value 
in addition  approximately million of the impairment loss was related to our option to invest in an internet wagering business 
in february  we announced that we intended to purchase a interest in kerzner interactive limited formerly sunonline limited kerzner interactive  a wholly owned subsidiary of kerzner international limited formerly sun international hotels limited kerzner 
kerzner interactive was to be the exclusive vehicle for both kerzner and us to pursue the internet wagering business 
in july  we converted our agreement to acquire a interest in kerzner interactive into an option to do so  and paid million for such option 
kerzner decided to discontinue kerzner interactive  as it targeted internet wagering only from jurisdictions that permitted online gaming 
as these jurisdictions became more restrictive in their acceptance of internet gaming  the market size was reduced and competition intensified  resulting in a substantial decrease in the probability of achieving profitability in the short to medium term 
as a result  we have written off the option payment and other costs related to this investment 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment loss with respect to a acre parcel  near the intersection of martin luther king jr 
drive and craig road in north las vegas 
this impairment loss was necessary because  after evaluating all of our options  we determined not to develop a casino on this site 
the assets included capitalized rent and design costs  which had no value after we made the decision not to develop a gaming facility on this parcel 
as of december   gaming was not permitted on this site due to zoning restrictions

we have asserted a claim against mr 
lazaroff and his former law firm to recover all damages caused by mr 
lazaroff s conduct 
as part of that claim  we intend to seek reimbursement for  among other things  the amount we were required to pay to settle the fitzgerald s litigation  as well as the attorney s fees and costs we incurred in defending that litigation 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering all or any portion of costs or damages

interest expense  net of capitalized interest  decreased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  gross interest expense decreased approximately million due to a decrease in our average cost of debt to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was offset somewhat by the effect of our interest rate swaps  which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million for the year ended december  as compared to a reduction of million in the year ended december  capitalized interest increased approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to interest capitalized for the construction of red rock station see future development 
interest expense  net of capitalized interest  decreased to million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  gross interest expense decreased approximately million over the same periods due to a decrease of million in total long term debt from the prior year excluding the interest rate swap mark to market adjustment 
the decrease in interest expense was also related to a decrease in the average cost of debt to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   which was directly related to the interest rate swaps that converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate

we anticipate the gaming and entertainment facility will be open some time during  but there can be no assurance that it will be completed at that time or at all 
north fork rancheria of mono indian tribe in march  we entered into development and management agreements with the north fork rancheria of mono indians mono  a federally recognized native american tribe located in central california 
we will assist the mono in developing and operating a gaming and entertainment facility to be located in madera county  california 
we have secured for the benefit of the mono two parcels of land located on highway north of the city of madera 
under the terms of the development agreement  we have agreed to arrange the financing for the ongoing development costs and construction of the facility 
although no firm construction budget has been established  we expect the total cost of the development and construction of the facility will be less than million 
funds advanced by us are expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the project financing or from the mono s gaming revenues 
the management agreement has a term of seven years from the opening of the facility and provides for a management fee of of the facility s net income 
as currently contemplated  the facility will include approximately  slot machines  table games and dining  hotel and entertainment amenities 
development of the gaming and entertainment project is subject to certain governmental and regulatory approvals  including  but not limited to  negotiating a gaming compact with the state of california  the united states department of the interior accepting the land into trust on behalf of the mono and approval of the management agreement by the nigc 
we anticipate the gaming and entertainment facility will be open some time in late  but there can be no assurance that it will be completed at that time or at all 
land acquisition we have acquired certain parcels of land in the las vegas valley and in sacramento  california as part of our development activities 
our decision whether to proceed with any new gaming or development opportunity is dependent upon future economic and regulatory factors  the availability of financing and competitive and strategic considerations 
as many of these considerations are beyond our control  no assurances can be made that we will be able to secure additional  acceptable financing in order to proceed with any particular project 
as of december   we had million of land held for development that consists primarily of six sites that are owned or leased  which comprise acres in the las vegas valley and acres in the sacramento area near thunder valley 
in addition  we have options to purchase a total of acres adjacent to one of the sites in the las vegas valley 
the durango site  located at the intersection of durango road and the southern beltway interstate in the southwest quadrant of las vegas  currently consists of acres 
in april  we exercised our option to purchase acres of land adjacent to acres of land previously owned at the durango site for million 
the boulder tropicana site is a acre site consisting of two parcels at the intersection of boulder highway and tropicana avenue in eastern las vegas 
we are leasing with an option to purchase acres of the site and own the adjacent acre parcel 
we also own a acre gaming entitled parcel in southwest las vegas at the intersection of flamingo road and interstate and a acre gaming entitled parcel at the intersection of boulder highway and nellis boulevard 
we also purchased approximately acres of land  which is adjacent to the acres previously purchased near thunder valley for approximately million in september we exercised our option to purchase the acre parcel of land on which wild wild west is located in pursuant to the lease  the purchase will take place in july at the fair market value of the land but not less than million or not more than approximately million 
no amounts related to this purchase option have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december  in may  we also purchased approximately acres of land adjacent to wild wild west for approximately million 
this property currently includes approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in a number of low rise buildings 
also in  we paid approximately million in conjunction with an agreement to purchase a acre parcel of land adjacent to wild wild west 
regulation and taxes we are subject to extensive regulation by the nevada gaming authorities and will be subject to regulation  which may or may not be similar to that in nevada  by any other jurisdiction in which we may conduct gaming activities in the future  including the national indian gaming commission and tribal gaming agency of the uaic 
the uaic and a number of other native american tribes in california are currently renegotiating certain provisions of the tribal state gaming compacts compacts to which they are a party 
although it is unclear what changes  if any  may ultimately be made to the compacts  such renegotiation may result in an increase in the fees paid by the uaic and other native american tribes to the state of california  an increase in the number of gaming devices that a native american tribe may operate and other obligations that are not currently required by the existing compacts 
changes in applicable laws  regulations or compact provisions could have a significant impact on our operations 
the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenue  particularly to the state of nevada and its counties and municipalities 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax law  or in the administration of such law  affecting the gaming industry 
in  the nevada legislature enacted various tax increases  which raised the tax on gross gaming revenue from to 
in addition  a payroll tax was enacted as well as increases in the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes 
the various taxes went into affect at various points throughout the second half of and the company anticipates that the annual impact of these new taxes and tax increases will be approximately million 
we believe that our recorded tax balances are adequate 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or in the administration of such law 
such changes  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
cash transaction reporting violations in april  we became aware of violations of certain gaming regulations regarding the reporting of certain cash transactions 
we self reported these violations to the nevada state gaming control board 
we  along with the nevada state gaming control board  are investigating the violations 
we are currently unable to determine the amount of fines or extent of sanctions  if any  which may be levied by the nevada state gaming control board or the federal government 
we believe the eventual outcome of this matter will occur in description of certain indebtedness and capital stock revolving facility in september  we completed our million revolving credit facility the revolving facility 
the revolving facility contains no principal amortization and matures in september the borrowers are the major operating subsidiaries and the revolving facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each  as defined in the revolving facility  as selected by us 
the margin above such rates  and the fee on the unfunded portions of the revolving facility  will vary quarterly based on our combined consolidated ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda each  as defined in the revolving facility 
as of december   the borrowers margin above the eurodollar rate on borrowings under the revolving facility was 
the maximum margin for eurodollar rate borrowings is 
the maximum margin for alternate base rate borrowings is 
as of december   the fee for the unfunded portion of the revolving facility was 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving facility  we have requested to increase the available borrowings to million 
the revolving facility contains certain financial and other covenants 
these include a maximum funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio for the borrowers combined of to for each quarter and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio for the preceding four quarters for the borrowers combined of to for each quarter 
as of december   the borrowers funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was to and the fixed charge coverage ratio was to 
in addition  the revolving facility has financial and other covenants  which state that the maximum consolidated funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio can be no more than to through june   which reduces to to on september  through december   to to on march  through june  and to to on september  other covenants limit prepayments of indebtedness or rent including subordinated debt other than re financings meeting certain criteria  limitations on asset dispositions  limitations on dividends  limitations on indebtedness  limitations on investments and limitations on capital expenditures 
as of december   our consolidated funded debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was to 
we have pledged the stock of all of our major subsidiaries 
senior and senior subordinated notes in  we completed offerings for a total of million of senior notes due in february the senior notes 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate equal to per annum and were priced at par 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay amounts outstanding on the previous revolving facility and to redeem the million senior subordinated notes  which were due in as a result of the redemption  we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million in in january  we completed an offering of million senior subordinated notes due in january that bear interest at a rate equal to 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay amounts outstanding on the revolving facility and to repurchase or redeem the million senior subordinated notes  which were due in in february  we completed an offering of million senior subordinated notes due in march that bear interest at a rate equal to 
the proceeds of this offering were used to repurchase a portion of the million senior subordinated notes due in july in march  we completed an additional offering of million of senior subordinated notes due in january and bear interest at a rate equal to 
this offering was an add on to the million senior subordinated notes issued in january as a result of the redemptions  we will record a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million in the first quarter of approximately million of the million senior subordinated notes were redeemed pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation and the remaining million were redeemed pursuant to our call option 
approximately million of the million senior subordinated notes were redeemed pursuant to a tender offer and consent solicitation and the remaining million will remain outstanding 
the consent solicitations effectively eliminated all of the covenants from the remaining senior subordinated notes 
in march  we issued a tender offer and consent solicitation for the million senior notes due in march  we also agreed to issue million of senior notes due in april the proceeds from this offering will be used to repurchase the million of senior notes 
subject to customary conditions and the tender of a majority in principal amount of the senior notes the transaction is expected to close on march  the following actual and unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming that the offerings and redemptions of our senior and senior subordinated notes mentioned above had occurred as of december  amounts in thousands december  actual proforma unaudited revolving facility due september   weighted average interest rate of approximately  senior notes due april   senior notes due february  a  senior subordinated notes due february   senior subordinated notes due march   senior subordinated notes due july    senior subordinated notes due december   other long term debt  interest at maturity dates ranging from to total long term debt   current portion of long term debt market value of interest rate swaps  total long term debt  net   a assumes all of the senior notes were repurchased 
the indentures the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes the notes contain certain customary financial and other covenants  which limit the company and its subsidiaries ability to incur additional debt 
at december   our consolidated coverage ratio as defined in the indentures was to 
the indentures provide that we may not incur additional indebtedness  other than specified types of indebtedness  unless the consolidated coverage ratio is at least to 
in the event our consolidated coverage ratio is below to  the covenant limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness for borrowings under the revolving facility not to exceed the greater of million or times operating cash flow as defined for the four most recent quarters  plus million 
the indentures also give the holders of the notes the right to require us to purchase the notes at of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest thereon upon a change of control and rating decline each as defined in the indentures of the company 
the covenants for the senior notes are essentially the same as our notes  except there are limitations on restricted payments and restricted investments  which limits payments of dividends and investments 
in addition  the indenture governing the senior notes contains a limitation on liens we can incur 
during  we entered into various interest rate swaps with members of our bank group to manage interest expense 
the interest rate swaps have converted a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate 
as of december   we had one remaining interest rate swap agreement with a total notional amount of million in which we pay a floating rate at december  of approximately and receive a fixed rate at december  of approximately 
the interest rate swap terminates in the net effect of all of the interest rate swaps resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in february  we entered into two additional interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million that is tied directly to our senior subordinated notes that we issued in january the interest rate swaps will convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to a floating rate based upon the six month libor rate 
at inception  we pay a floating rate of six month libor plus and receive a fixed rate of 
the interest rate swaps terminate in on october   we redeemed the million senior subordinated notes 
the redemption was funded with proceeds from the revolving facility 
we recorded a charge of approximately million during the year ended december   to reflect the write off of the unamortized debt discount  unamortized loan costs and the premium to redeem the million senior subordinated notes 
this charge was partially offset by approximately million from the adjusted basis of the debt as a result of the fair value hedge termination that was tied directly to the million senior subordinated notes  as discussed below 
in addition  we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of approximately million in to reflect the write off of the unamortized loan costs on the previous revolving facility 
in september  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  which was due to terminate in the interest rate swap was terminated at its market value and  as a result  we received approximately million 
this interest rate swap was tied directly to the million senior subordinated notes 
the mark to market adjustment was amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the original contract life of the interest rate swap 
when the million senior subordinated notes were redeemed on october   the adjusted basis of the debt as a result of the fair value hedge termination of approximately million was included in the calculation of the net loss on the early retirement of the related debt 
the interest rate swaps that we entered into qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively  representing the fair value of the interest rate swaps and a corresponding increase in long term debt  as these interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by sfas no 
in december  we terminated an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  which was due to terminate in the interest rate swap was terminated at its market value and  as a result  we received approximately million 
this interest rate swap was tied directly to the million senior subordinated notes 
the mark to market adjustment will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the original contract life of the interest rate swap and as of december  the remaining balance of million is included in long term debt 
a majority of this mark to market adjustment will be included in the calculation of the net loss on early retirement of debt in the first quarter of as a result of the redemption of a majority of the million senior subordinated notes in february green valley ranch station financing green valley ranch station is owned by a joint venture between us and gcr gaming 
the joint venture financed green valley ranch station with a group of banks  and originally provided for borrowings up to million at a margin above the libor rate of up to basis points 
in december  green valley ranch station entered into an amended and restated loan agreement  which replaced the original financing 
the available borrowings have been increased to million as of december  the proceeds from the amended agreement were used to pay off secured equipment and other financing and to fund the expansion of the facility 
green valley ranch station has entered into an agreement to swap the majority of its floating rate to a fixed rate that will approximate during the term of the loan 
the loan requires a limited make well of million  if necessary based on operating results of the property 
pursuant to the make well agreement  if green valley ranch station fails to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio or the leverage ratio both as defined in the green valley ranch credit agreement  the partners will be required to make cash equity contributions in such amounts as required  which will result in pro forma compliance with the covenants 
the make well is a joint and several obligation of each partner  with gcr gaming s obligation collateralized 
the make well agreement will terminate upon achieving a post expansion debt to adjusted ebitda as defined ratio of less than or equal to to and producing adjusted ebitda before management fees of at least million 
as of december   the debt to adjusted ebitda ratio was to 
the outstanding balance of the green valley ranch station revolving credit facility as of december   was approximately million 
in december and march  green valley ranch station entered into interest rate swaps that have converted a portion of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate and are matched to a portion of its revolving facility 
at december   the combined notional amount of the interest rate swaps was million  and decreases by varying amounts each quarter 
as of december   green valley ranch station was paying a weighted average fixed rate of on the interest rate swaps and was receiving a weighted average floating rate based on three month libor of 
these interest rate swaps were also priced to have no value at inception 
as a result of the mark to market valuation of the interest rate swaps  we recorded approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively  for our share of the green valley ranch station interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
united auburn indian community financing we have entered into a development services agreement and a management agreement with the uaic 
pursuant to those agreements  and in compliance with a memorandum of understanding entered by the uaic and placer county  california  we developed  with the uaic  thunder valley  a gaming and entertainment facility on approximately acres located approximately seven miles north of interstate  in placer county  california  near sacramento  which opened on june  on september   the united states department of the interior accepted the land into trust on behalf of the uaic 
the acceptance of the land into trust followed the decision of the united states district court for the district of washington  dc  dismissing a lawsuit filed by the cities of roseville and rocklin  california  and citizens for safer communities  which challenged the united states department of the interior s decision to accept the land into trust 
immediately following the district court s decision  the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
on november   the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the lawsuit by the district court 
on february   the citizens for safer communities filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court  seeking to appeal the decision of the court of appeals 
the remaining plaintiffs did not seek to appeal that decision 
notwithstanding the court of appeals decision and the acceptance of the land into trust  there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of the citizens for safer communities pending efforts to appeal that decision 
our seven year management agreement was approved by the national indian gaming commission and expires in june we receive a management fee equal to of the facility s net income  as defined  which totaled approximately million for the year ended december  we also received a development fee equal to of the cost of the project upon the opening of the facility  which totaled approximately million  net of certain expenses  for the year ended december   and is included in other operating revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
thunder valley has  class iii slot machines  table games  including a private vip gaming area  a seat bingo room  three specialty restaurants  a seat buffet  a food court  a center pit bar and parking for over  vehicles 
we assisted the uaic in obtaining million of financing for the project through a group of lenders  and we provided an unlimited completion guaranty and credit support for all amounts outstanding under such financing 
based on the current level of operating results of thunder valley  we expect the credit support to terminate in june we have evaluated our obligations related to the completion guaranty in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others and have determined that the fair value of the obligation is not material 
prior to the completion of the financing  we advanced approximately million to the uaic for the development of thunder valley

treasury stock during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we are authorized to repurchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock

critical accounting policies significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain of our accounting policies  including the determination of bad debt reserves  the estimated useful lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the gaming industry and information available from other outside sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
to provide an understanding of the methodology we apply  our significant accounting policies and basis of presentation are discussed below  as well as where appropriate in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances we recognize as casino revenues the net win from gaming activities  which is the difference between gaming wins and losses 
all other revenues are recognized as the service is provided 
revenues include the retail value of food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise provided on a complimentary basis to customers 
such amounts are then deducted from revenues as promotional allowances on our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated departmental costs of providing such promotional allowances are included in casino costs and expenses 
slot club programs our boarding pass and amigo club player rewards programs the programs allow customers to redeem points earned from their gaming activity at all station and fiesta properties for complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise 
at the time redeemed  the retail value of complimentaries under the programs are recorded as revenue with a corresponding offsetting amount included in promotional allowances 
the cost associated with complimentary food  beverage  rooms  entertainment and merchandise redeemed under the programs is recorded in casino costs and expenses 
we also record a liability for the estimated cost of the outstanding points under the programs 
self insurance reserves we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for workers compensation  major medical and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
guarantee obligations in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that future guarantee obligations be recognized as liabilities at inception of the guarantee contract and increases the disclosures required for current and future guarantee obligations 
we adopted the initial recognition provisions of fin beginning january  and have included the disclosures required in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
derivative instruments we enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to manage interest rate risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings 
the interest rate swaps that we have entered into qualify for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as an asset or liability on our balance sheet with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of the related debt 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the capitalized lease  whichever is less 
costs of major improvements are capitalized  while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we evaluate our property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset to be sold at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal 
fair market value for assets to be disposed of is generally estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review fixed assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
if an indicator of impairment exists  we compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value  with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  goodwill and other intangibles the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in june sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill  including goodwill recorded in past business combinations  ceased upon the adoption of sfas no 
we implemented sfas no 
on january  and tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of and annually perform such test 
in order to test for impairment of goodwill  we use the income approach  which focuses on the income producing capability of the respective property 
the underlying premise of this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present worth of the net economic benefit cash receipts less cash outlays to be received over the life of the subject asset 
the steps followed in applying this approach include estimating the expected after tax cash flows attributable to the respective property and converting these after tax cash flows to present value through discounting 
the discounting process uses a rate of return  which accounts for both the time value of money and investment risk factors 
the present value of the after tax cash flows is then totaled to arrive at an indication of the fair value of the goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill exceeds the carrying value  then impairment is measured based on the difference between the calculated fair value and the carrying value 
our consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments required by sfas no 
as of december  capitalization of interest we capitalize interest costs associated with debt incurred in connection with major construction projects 
interest capitalization ceases once the project is substantially complete or no longer undergoing construction activities to prepare it for its intended use 
when no debt is specifically identified as being incurred in connection with such construction projects  we capitalize interest on amounts expended on the project at our weighted average cost of borrowed money 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states of america and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of fin is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
fin changes certain consolidation requirements by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
in october and december  the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of fin for variable interests held by public companies in all entities that were acquired prior to february  to the quarter ending march  for entities acquired after february   we were required to adopt fin for the quarter ended september  our acquisition of our interest in mpm  which we agreed to purchase in november  was subject to the provisions of fin and as a result  we have consolidated mpm in our consolidated financial statements at december   as this entity qualifies as a variable interest entity 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment to statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is applied prospectively and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for sfas no 
implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june  and certain provisions relating to forward purchases and sales on securities that do not yet exist 
we have determined that sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  on october   the fasb voted to defer for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas no 
to non controlling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of the subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements under sfas no 
the fasb decided to defer the application of fasb no 
to these non controlling interests until it could consider some of the resulting implementation issues associated with the measurement and recognition guidance for these non controlling interests 
we currently have no instruments impacted by the adoption of this statement and therefore the adoption did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
borrowings under the revolving facility bear interest at a margin above the alternate base rate or the eurodollar rate each  as defined in the revolving facility as selected by us 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate and may be reduced from time to time

this market risk is managed by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we evaluate our exposure to market risk by monitoring interest rates in the marketplace  and do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our derivative financial instruments consist exclusively of interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched with specific fixed rate debt obligations
