we are serving as a subcontractor to stewart stevenson services which is contracted with lockheed martin under a u 
s 
army and us marine corps program to supply a ballistically armored and sealed truck cab for the himars 
the truck is used to fire missiles that are a part of either the multiple launch rocket system or the army tactical missile system 
this program consisted of shipping several prototypes in and for test and evaluation by the us army and us marine corps  and has been transitioned to a low rate initial production in we market armor sub systems for other tactical wheeled vehicles  such as medium and heavy military trucks 
we also produce various armor systems as a subcontractor to a number of large defense contractors 
these products include armor for containers for fuels and missile launchers and for pilot protection 
these specialized armoring products often involve the use of unique materials or methods 
commercial products 
we armor a variety of vehicles  including limousines  sedans  sport utility vehicles  commercial trucks and cash in transit vehicles  to protect against varying degrees of ballistic and blast threats 
the commercial vehicle armoring process begins with the disassembly of a new base vehicle 
this disassembly normally involves the removal of the interior trim  seats  doors and windows 
the passenger compartment then is armored with both opaque and transparent armor 
other features  such as run flat tires and non exploding gas tanks  may also be added 
finally  the vehicle is reassembled as close to its original appearance as possible 
the entire conversion process results in a low profile  integrated ballistic protective system 
our relationship with various vehicle manufacturers has been valuable in permitting us to armor certain vehicles while allowing the customer to maintain the benefits of warranties issued by the vehicle manufacturer 
the mobile security division shipped  commercial armored vehicles in we produce fully armored vehicles and light armored vehicles 
fully armored commercial vehicles  such as limousines  large sedans or sport utility vehicles  typically are armored to protect against attacks from military assault rifles such as ak s and ms 
these vehicles also can be blast protected by enhancing the ballistic and underbody protection with proprietary materials and installation methods that protect the occupants against a defined blast threat 
blast protected vehicles defend against threats such as pipe bombs attached to the exterior of the vehicle 
fully armored vehicles typically sell for  to  exclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
fully armored vehicles also include parade cars  which are formal limousines used predominantly for official functions by a president or other head of state 
these vehicles are usually customized based upon a commercially available chassis  which we essentially rebuild completely 
because the threat of organized assassination attempts is greater for heads of state  these vehicles normally incorporate more advanced armor and sophisticated protection features 
these features can include supplemental air and oxygen systems  air purification systems to protect against chemical or biological contamination  underbody fire suppressant systems  tear gas launchers  anti explosive self sealing fuel tanks  electric deadbolt door locks  gun ports and bomb scanners 
parade cars normally sell for  to in excess of million  inclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
light armored vehicles are similar in all respects to fully armored vehicles except that we add substantially less total weight to a light armored vehicle 
therefore  it is possible to armor smaller vehicles such as the volkswagen jetta and the general motors omega  as well as larger vehicles such as the mercedes benz s and the jeep grand cherokee 
light armored vehicles are designed to protect against attacks from handguns 
the price of a light armored vehicle ranges from  to  exclusive of the cost of the base vehicle 
we also produce specialty vehicles and cash in transit vehicles 
specialty vehicles are custom built for a specific mission 
examples of specialty vehicles are escort cars  usually convertibles  and chase cars  usually closed top vehicles  in which security personnel ride while in a head of state motorcade 
cash in transit vehicles are used by banks or other businesses to transport currency and other valuables 
after starting with a van or small truck  we modify the base vehicle to provide protection for the cargo and passengers from ballistic and blast threats

simula is the largest producer of sapi plates in the world 
sapi plates of similar design are also produced by protech in the armor holdings products division 
the combined production of simula and protech represents more than percent of the us military market share for these products 
more than  sapi plates have been produced to date 
we have applied our technologies and overall knowledge of materials and structures to develop a parachute system that solves numerous functional problems attendant to traditional military bailout parachutes 
our thin pack parachute tpp incorporates patented environmental sealing technology  which reduces repackaging and maintenance costs  and extends the service life of the parachute without jeopardizing user safety 
to date  we have supplied over  tpps to the us navy 
we have also developed a line of flotation collars that are designed to provide additional buoyancy for a person that enters water in an emergency 
the basic configuration of the product  called the low profile flotation collar  can fit a wide range of applications 
for example  aviators that eject or bailout can use it over water and rescue swimmers  divers and naval personnel can utilize it as well 
in addition  it can be worn with a wide range of other equipment and clothing for ground troops being ferried over water and also by commercial personnel who work around water 
the us navy  us marine corps  and the us air fore have adopted our system 
to date  we have supplied over  collars 
we have seen a trend among our customers to integrate various armor  survival and flotation technologies in a common vest ensemble 
we were selected to develop the us army s new air warrior ensemble and the product will begin sales in the army has a stated need for  over systems 
the air warrior ensemble may also be adopted by other services 
technology development and licensing 
an important part of our business is a growing portfolio of licensed technologies 
our principal licenses include soft armor and a patented family of transparent polymers 
we currently license our patented simulite tm material technology to second chance body armor  for use in concealable personal body armor used by police forces 
simula has developed a number of advanced transparent polymers  trademarked as cleargardtm  and has introduced these materials to a variety of customers in numerous markets

customers products division 
in  we sold approximately of our products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the primary end users of our products are federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  local police departments  state corrections facilities  us and allied militaries  highway patrols and sheriffs departments 
we reach these customers through a distribution strategy that utilizes a worldwide distribution network of approximately domestic distributors and international agents  as well as approximately domestic sales representatives  three regional sales managers  and six technical sales specialists  who promote our products but refer customers to a local distributor for purchasing 
mobile security division 
in  we sold approximately of our products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the market for military hardware products is worldwide in scope  including the us military and foreign defense forces 
the primary contract for delivery of up armored hmmwvs is with the us military  although smaller quantities are also sold overseas 
we also serve as a subcontractor to provide ballistically armored and sealed truck cabs for himars for use by the us army and the us marine corps  a program recently transitioned to low rate initial production 
our armored commercial vehicle customers include governmental and private buyers 
us and foreign governmental buyers who purchase both fully and light armored vehicles 
governmental buyers and foreign royalty also comprise the market for parade cars 
typically  governmental buyers consist of ministries of foreign affairs  defense and internal affairs and offices of presidential security 
these customers are not constrained in their purchasing decisions by considerations such as import duties and taxes and are free to search globally for the best product available 
the procurement cycles of governmental buyers can range from relatively rapid  when the vehicles are for the use of the head of state or in response to a particular crisis  to prolonged highly documented bids and evaluations for normally budgeted items 
private customers for armored commercial vehicles include corporations and individuals 
private buyers tend to be more price sensitive and will often purchase locally manufactured vehicles to reduce taxes and avoid import duties 
local servicing of the vehicle is also a critical concern to private buyers 
customers for cash in transit vehicles are generally companies that provide cash in transit services to financial institutions 
purchasing decisions for cash in transit vehicles depend on many criteria including insurance  regulatory requirements and costs  and whether the financial institution is private or governmental 
simula 
in  simula sold more than of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
sales of our products to all branches of the united states military and its prime contractors such as boeing and sikorsky aircraft represented approximately of our revenue 
our businesses have relied to a great extent on relatively few major customers  although saw the development of additional major users of our products within our existing customer base eg other users within the eg army 
we believe that historical customers  such as the us army and other branches of the united states military  to whom we have supplied products for approximately years  will continue to be major customers 
current commercial and licensing customers include boeing  bell helicopter textron  second chance body armor  ppg industries  intercast europe  and avon rubber company 
the loss of or significant reduction in sales to a major customer could potentially harm our business  operations and financial condition 
approximately of our revenues were from our ten largest customers for the year ended december  fiscal 
approximately of our revenues came from us military contracts 
the products division s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total products revenues for fiscal the mobile security division s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total mobile security division s revenues for fiscal approximately of the mobile security division s revenues for fiscal were derived from us military contracts  and an additional were derived from commercial contracts with non military us governmental agencies and foreign governments 
military and governmental contracts generally are awarded on a periodic or sporadic basis 
if the mobile security division were to lose the hmmwv contract  which continues through june  the division s financial performance would experience a materially negative impact 
simula s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues for fiscal marketing and distribution products division 
as a result of our history of providing high quality and reliable concealable armor  tactical armor  hard armor  duty gear  less lethal munitions  anti riot products and forensic products  we enjoy broad brand name recognition and a strong reputation in the law enforcement equipment industry 
the central element of our marketing strategy is to capitalize on our brand name recognition and reputation among our customers by positioning ourselves as an international provider of many of the premier security risk management products that our customers require 
by positioning ourselves in this manner  we expect to capitalize on our existing customer base and our extensive global distribution network  and to maximize the benefits of our long history of supplying security related products around the world 
we have designed comprehensive training programs to provide initial and continuing training in the proper use of our various products 
these training programs  offered by the training academy for technology and tactics  are typically conducted by trained law enforcement and military personnel that we hire for such purposes 
training programs are an integral part of our customer service strategy 
in addition to enhancing customer satisfaction  we believe that training also helps breed customer loyalty and brand awareness 
moreover  many of our products are consumable and used in training  which generates replacement orders 
our marketing efforts are further augmented by our involvement with and support of several important law enforcement associations  including the national tactical officer s association  the international law enforcement firearms instructors  the american society of law enforcement trainers and the international association of chiefs of police 
we further reinforce distributor loyalty by offering price discounts to high volume distributors 
we believe that we have strong relationships with our distributors 
the distributors benefit from their association with us due to the quality of our products  the scope of our product line  the high degree of service we provide and the distributor s opportunity to participate profitably in the sale of our products 
we continually seek to expand our distribution network 
as we identify and acquire businesses that fit strategically into our existing product portfolio  we maximize our distribution network by offering additional products  accessing new customers and penetrating new geographic markets 
we also sell a selected number of civilian products into mass merchandise and sporting goods stores via a network of national sporting goods wholesalers 
these products include concealment holsters  hunting and sports shooting accessories  cleaning equipment and pepper spray products 
in addition to our traditional distribution channels  we also sell our products on the world wide web through a variety of sites 
gsa buy 
com contains an on line catalog and secured transaction platform for all products division general services administration contracts targeting government agencies exclusively 
we also sell a small array of our concealable and competition holsters to the consumer market on holsters 
com  limiting distribution of our law enforcement equipment to law enforcement channels of distribution 
mobile security division 
on a worldwide basis  the mobile security division employs approximately full time sales professionals in connection with its commercial sales 
these employees operate out of washington  dc  fairfield  ohio  sao paulo  brazil  lamballe  france  mexico city  mexico  bogota  colombia  bremen  germany  geneva  switzerland and caracas  venezuela 
all personnel have a geographic and or product specific responsibility 
in most cases  the sales personnel also recruit and maintain sales agents or distributors 
the agents or distributors have geographic and product specific agreements  and compensation in most cases is based upon a commission arrangement 
sales personnel use a consultative approach when offering solutions to customers security problems 
sales cycles for commercial physical security products can range from several months to a matter of days  depending upon the product and the urgency associated with the security problem being addressed 
the mobile security division has positioned itself in the marketplace as a commercial company with a military production capability 
as such  the mobile security division emphasizes its ability to develop new products  or product adaptations  quickly and more cost effectively than traditional defense contractors 
in marketing its products to the military  the mobile security division places strong emphasis on its superior antitank and antipersonnel mine protection for the occupants of tactical wheeled vehicles 
we market our military products through a combination of trade show exhibitions  print advertising in military related periodicals and direct customer visits 
we emphasize the cross marketing of military and commercial products  which we believe strengthens the image of each product group 
we have also entered into exclusive teaming and joint marketing agreements with various prime contractors in connection with the up armored hmmwv and up armoring for himars and family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv for sales in domestic and international military and commercial areas 
such agreements allow us to benefit from the prime contractor s marketing network and save on certain selling costs 
our military sales activities are directed toward identifying contract bid opportunities with various us government agencies and prime contractors 
international sales are made through the department of defense s foreign military sales program and directly to foreign military organizations 
we have three full time business development managers who are responsible for this activity and have contractual arrangements with several outside consultants who assist the business development managers in their activities 
proposal preparation and presentation for government projects is done by a team  which normally consists of program managers  a contracting officer  a cost accountant and various manufacturing and engineering personnel 
simula most of simula s products are distributed as a component supplier to original equipment manufacturers oems or as a direct contractor to the us government 
the products are built to order 
we do not directly serve mass consumer markets and supply directly from manufacturing facilities 
thus  the distribution of simula s products does not involve significant inventory  warehousing or shipping methodologies 
depending upon the product  we typically employ one of four methods for marketing i direct sales  ii technical teams  typically comprised of a combination of sales personnel and engineers  iii strategic alliances with oems and us government prime contractors  and iv responses to formal request for proposals in bidding for government contracts 
in marketing our safety restraint and seating products  we endeavor to maintain close relationships with existing customers and to establish new customer relationships 
ongoing relationships and repeat customers are an important source of business for our current and new products 
our marketing and sales activities in the government sector focus primarily upon identifying research and development and other contract opportunities with various agencies of the united states government or with others acting as prime contractors on government projects 
key members of our engineering and project management staffs maintain close working relationships with representatives of the united states military and their prime contractors 
through these relationships  we monitor needs  trends  and opportunities within current military product lines 
product manufacturing and raw materials the raw materials used in manufacturing ballistic resistant garments and up armored vehicles include various ballistic fibers such as kevlar  twaron  spectrashield  zylon and z shield 
kevlar is a patented product of ei du pont de nemours co  inc du pont and is only available from du pont and its european licensee 
we purchase twaron  spectrashield  zylon and z shield fibers directly from the manufacturers  and from weaving companies who convert the raw fibers into ballistic fabric 
we believe that we enjoy a good relationship with these suppliers 
however  if necessary  we believe that we could readily find replacement weavers 
we also use spectrashield and kevlar in our hard and vehicle armor products 
additionally  we use polycarbonates  acrylics  ballistic quality steel  ceramics  and ballistic glass 
we are aware of multiple suppliers for these materials and would not anticipate a significant impact if we were to lose any suppliers 
we purchase other raw materials used in the manufacture of our various products from a variety of sources and additional sources of supply of these materials are readily available 
we also own several molds  which are used throughout our less lethal product line 
we adhere to strict quality control standards and conduct extensive product testing throughout our manufacturing processes 
raw materials are also tested to ensure quality 
we have obtained iso certification for our wyoming manufacturing facility for less lethal products  our facility in pittsfield  massachusetts for hard armor products  and our facility in ontario  california for body armor and duty gear holsters and accessories 
we have obtained iso certification for our westhoughton  england manufacturing facility for body armor and high visibility garments 
iso standards are promulgated by the international organization of standardization and have been adopted by more than countries worldwide 
we obtain iso certification by successfully completing an audit certifying our compliance with a comprehensive series of quality management and quality control standards 
we emphasize engineering excellence and have an extensive engineering staff 
design engineers use state of the art two dimensional and three dimensional computer aided design and engineering or cad cae systems in conjunction with coordinate measuring machines to develop electronic models  which generally are converted to solid models or prototypes 
manufacturing engineers concentrate on improvements in the production process and on overall cost reductions from better methods  fewer components and less expensive materials with equal or superior quality 
applying these techniques  we reduced both the time and cost necessary to produce armored vehicles 
our ballistic engineers  in conjunction with our design and manufacturing engineers  develop and test new ballistic and blast protection systems that meet ever changing threats 
simula s production and manufacturing consist principally of the molding of armor and composite materials  ceramic tile cutting and grinding  adhesive bonding  sewing  component fabrication  and final assembly 
simula outsources substantial quantities of machining  metal fabrication and welding 
our manufacturing capability features computer integrated manufacturing programs which  among other things  schedule and track production  update inventories  and issue work orders to the manufacturing floor 
all products manufactured must meet rigorous standards and specifications for workmanship  process  raw materials  procedures  and testing  and in some cases regulatory requirements 
products are functionally tested on a sample basis as required by applicable contracts 
customers  and in some cases the united states government as the end user  perform periodic quality audits of the manufacturing process 
certain customers  including the united states government  periodically send representatives to our facilities to monitor quality assurance 
simula s operations are certified to the iso standard by as and iso by british standards institution  inc bsi

plaintiffs sought damages of million 
on april   the tribunal rendered an interim award in our favor on the first three counts 
however  it reserved the opportunity for plaintiffs to provide proof of damages noting that any damages ami crown may have suffered on this remaining issue would be limited based on the facts 
on march   the arbitrators found that the plaintiffs had failed to offer any evidence of damages  and therefore  they dismissed all of the claims against us 
further the arbitrators directed ami crown to pay us our costs 
unfortunately  ami and crown have filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors so recovery of our costs is doubtful

ohe brazil was audited by the brazilian federal tax authorities and assessed over ten million reals us million based on the exchange rate as of december  
ohe brazil has appealed the tax assessment and the case is pending 
to the extent that there may be any liability resulting from the audit  we believe that we are entitled to indemnification from kroll  inc under the terms of our purchase agreement dated april   despite the denial by kroll  inc of any such liability  because the events occurred prior to our purchase of the o gara companies from kroll  inc however  to the extent that the appeal relating to activity results in an unfavorable ruling  we could be liable for unpaid taxes incurred subsequent to the acquisition from kroll 
in and prior to our acquisition of oheac in  several of the former employees of kroll o gara company de mexico  sa de sa o gara mexico  a subsidiary of oheac  commenced labor claims against o gara mexico seeking damages for unjustified termination 
these cases are still pending before the labor board in mexico city 
the terminated employees are seeking back pay and benefits since the date of termination amounting to approximately us million  and accruing at approximately us  per month 
to the extent that there may be any liability  we believe that we are entitled to indemnification from kroll  inc under the terms of our purchase agreement dated april   despite the denial by kroll  inc of any such liability  because the events occurred prior to our purchase of the o gara companies from kroll  inc although we do not have any insurance coverage for this matter  at this time  we do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity

further  lft seeks to have ohe france  as the sole tenant  maintain and repair the leased building 
the approximate cost of renovating the building is estimated to be between us and us million  based on the exchange rate as of december  the case is currently pending  and while we are contesting the allegations vigorously  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
although we do not have any insurance coverage for this matter  at this time  we do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity 
on or about march   oheac received a civil subpoena from the department of defense dod requesting documents and information concerning various quality control documentation regarding parts delivered by its subcontractors and vendors in support of the hmmwvs armored at its fairfield  ohio facility for the period october  through may  oheac has complied fully with the subpoena 
in early  oheac was advised that the department of justice doj was also investigating separate claims against oheac filed by individuals that involve the same time frame and issues covered by the dod subpoena 
oheac has learned that the doj investigation relates to a certain unidentified action filed under the federal false claims act pursuant to which the united states government may intervene and recover damages 
oheac has fully responded to  and cooperated with  the government s questions and investigation 
the doj has since notified oheac that it has declined to intervene in the case 
on september   the action filed under the federal false claims act was voluntarily withdrawn without prejudice 
on october   we were notified by the internal revenue service that our tax return for the tax year ended december  had been selected for examination 
further  on january  we were notified that our tax return for the tax year ended december  had been selected for examination 
the examinations are currently pending  and at this time we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters 
however  we do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity 
in october  we were sued in the united states district court for the district of wyoming with respect to one of our subsidiaries casper  wyoming tear gas plant 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit asserted various state law tort claims and federal environmental law claims under the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act stemming from the tear gas plant 
in february  we agreed with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit for an amount of money that is not material to us and the plaintiffs have agreed to dismiss their lawsuit with prejudice 
in september  second chance body armor  inc  a body armor manufacturer and one of our competitors  has notified its customers of a potential safety issue with its ultima r and ultimax r models 
second chance body armor has claimed that zylon r fiber  which is made by toyobo  a japanese corporation  and used in the ballistic fabric construction of its ultima r and ultimax r models  degraded more rapidly than originally anticipated 
second chance body armor has also stated that the zylon r degradation problem affects the entire body armor industry  not just its products 
both private claimants and state attorneys general have already commenced legal action against second chance body armor based upon its ultima r and ultimax r model vests and we have received investigative demands from state agencies in texas and connecticut 
second chance body armor licenses from simula a certain patented technology which is used in some of the body armor it manufactures  but to our knowledge  no lawsuit has yet been brought against second chance body armor based upon this licensed technology  although a letter was received by simula from an attorney representing a police officer who was injured while wearing a second chance body armor vest alleging potential liability against simula 
in addition  the us attorney general has asked the us department of justice to investigate the claims regarding the use of zylon r in bulletproof vests  which we use in the manufacturing of certain of our body armor models for law enforcement personnel 
as simula has licensed its technology to second chance body armor  it may be impacted by the pending claims against second chance body armor and the investigation being conducted by the us department of justice 
if simula is included in the claims pending against second chance body armor and the investigation being conducted by the us department of justice  we cannot assure you that any judgment  settlement or resolution against simula will not have a material impact on simula s financial position  operations or liquidity 
the national institute of justice nij is engaged in an ongoing inquiry and investigation of bullet resistant vests and the protocol for testing used vests  as well as the reliability of zylon and other fibers 
we have consulted with and cooperated fully with the nij in this endeavor 
to date  the nij has embarked only in its first phase of testing  which entails vests that have been heavily worn or exposed to adverse conditions  and which involves the ballistic standard applicable to new vests 
although some of the vests tested  including ours  experienced some level of penetration  the nij specifically warned against the misuse and misinterpretation of these results  emphasizing that the data produced so far is preliminary in nature  applies to a very small sample size and therefore it is not possible to draw any statistically based conclusions from these results 
the nij will continue to conduct further testing and analyze these issues in order to determine if any conclusions can be reached as to the performance and reliability of aged vests 
we have requested the nij to provide us with its testing data  and we intend to evaluate and review the nij results in our continuing effort to assist the nij in developing uniform standards for certification of new vests and the testing of used vests 
the nij continues to encourage law enforcement officers to wear body armor  in light of the fact that the lives of more than  law enforcement officers have been saved by the use of bullet resistant body armor over the past years 
in addition to the above  in the normal course of business  we are subjected to various types of claims and currently have on going litigations in the areas of products liability and general liability 
our products are used in a wide variety of law enforcement situations and environments 
some of our products can cause serious personal or property injury or death if not carefully and properly used by adequately trained personnel 
we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for most claims that are incurred in the normal course of business 
in such cases  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount of our insurance deductible or self insured retention 
our annual insurance premiums and self insurance retention amounts have risen significantly over the past several years and may continue to do so to the extent we are able to purchase insurance coverage 
at this time  we do not believe any such claims or pending litigation will have a material impact on our financial position  operations and liquidity

we are actively attempting to sell this business and expect to sell it during critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  the use of estimates  income taxes and impairment 
revenue recognition 
we record products revenue at the time of shipment 
returns are minimal and do not materially affect the financial statements 
we record revenue from our mobile security division when the vehicle is shipped  except for larger commercial contracts typically longer than four months in length and the contract for the delivery of hmmwvs to the us government on which revenue is recognized on a units completed bases with completion occurring upon inspection and acceptance by the us government 
this contract continues through revenue from such larger contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion  units of work performed method 
hmmwv units sold to the us government are considered complete when the onsite department of defense officer finishes the inspection of the hmmwv and approves it for delivery 
should such contracts be in a loss position  the entire estimated loss would be recognized for the balance of the contract at such time 
we believe that our current contracts are profitable 
we record service revenue as services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from service contracts are recognized over the term of the contract 
estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements include periodic testing of the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment  valuation allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation claims and settlements  and contract contingencies and obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method specified thereunder  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities are offset by deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
future benefits obtained either from utilization of net operating loss carryforwards or from the reduction in the income tax asset valuation allowance existing on september  have been and will be applied to reduce reorganization value in excess of amounts allocable to identifiable assets 
at december  and  our consolidated foreign subsidiaries have unremitted earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  on which the company has not recorded a provision for united states federal income taxes since these earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
such foreign earnings have been taxed according to the regulations existing in the countries in which they were earned 
impairment 
long lived assets including certain identifiable intangibles  and the goodwill related to those assets  are reviewed annually for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable including  but not limited to  a deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  and when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
management reviewed the company s long lived assets and has taken an impairment charge of million in fiscal and million in fiscal to reduce the carrying value of the services division to estimated realizable value 
the method used to determine the existence of an impairment would be discounted operating cash flows estimated over the remaining useful lives of the related long lived assets for continuing operations in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and unamortized cost at the date impairment is determined 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  a component classified as held for sale is reported in discontinued operations when the following conditions are met a the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity as a result of the disposal transaction and b the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction 
in a period in which a component of an entity either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale  the income statement for current and prior periods reports the results of operations of the component  including any estimated impairment gain or loss recognized in accordance with sfas paragraph  in discontinued operations 
the results of discontinued operations  less applicable income taxes benefit  is reported as a separate component of income before extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes if applicable 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the asset and liability sections  respectively  of the statement of financial position

excluding our products training division subsidiary  the products division gross margins were  compared to in gross margins in the mobile security division were in fiscal  compared to for fiscal the increase in the mobile security gross margins was primarily attributable to favorable manufacturing overhead cost absorption relating to increased manufacturing volumes at our cincinnati manufacturing facility  and operational efficiencies at our cincinnati manufacturing facility

provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes on continuing operations was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal based on our annual income amounts and jurisdictions in which such amounts were taxable 
the effective income tax rate of is higher than the estimated effective income tax rate that was utilized in the first half of due to  among other things the non tax deductible nature of the non cash  non recurring stock based compensation that was provided to certain key executives  and a taxable gain that was realized in the second half of when certain intellectual property utilized in our discontinued operations was revalued in order to comply with tax code provisions 
the impact of the incremental tax associated with the revalued intellectual property is recorded in continuing operations as required by generally accepted accounting principles  and resulted in an incremental non cash tax expense  for which foreign tax credits are available to offset the tax otherwise payable

our mobile security division revenues increased million  or to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal revenues for fiscal included only four months of operations after the acquisitions of o gara hess eisenhardt armoring company  the o gara company  and o gara security associates  inc in august revenues in fiscal include million related to the acquisition of trasco bremen in september including the eight months of operations prior to our ownership and excluding all revenue associated with assets that we either did not purchase or sold  mobile security division revenue increased internally from approximately million during fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to the acquisition of the armor mobile security division as well as overall revenue growth for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  cost of sales increased to of total revenues for fiscal from for fiscal this increase as a percentage of total revenues was partially due to the full year inclusion in of the mobile security division  which operates at lower average gross margins than the products division and partially to reduced products division margins as discussed below 
for fiscal  gross margins in the products division were compared to reported in the same period last year  while the gross margins in the mobile security division were in fiscal  compared to for the four months of the december  fiscal year after the acquisition date 
the products division consists of a portfolio of law enforcement products  each of which is manufactured and sold at different margins 
in any given period  the products division weighted average gross margins will fluctuate based upon the relative volume of products sold during the period 
lower gross margins during fiscal in the products division were partially attributable to product mix  as well as to short term increases in manufacturing costs and a raw material supply issues in the division s body armor operations during the first half of during late and  the products division combined its jacksonville  florida based body armor operation into its body armor manufacturing facility in ontario  california 
during  the division experienced difficulty in this combination resulting in capacity constraints and increased manufacturing costs 
we believe that these capacity constraints have been alleviated and that certain of our body armor manufacturing costs will decrease during the first half of however  during this time  we also experienced interruptions in the supply of zylon shield  a certain ballistic fiber used in our leading concealable ballistic vest 
this particular supply problem was related to the ballistic integrity of the fiber we received and not the actual availability of the material 
nevertheless  our inability to receive quality zylon shield during this period exacerbated our capacity constraints 
as of december   the division is currently receiving adequate supplies of zylon shield and is currently working to decrease its body armor manufacturing costs 
the products division gross margins also decreased because it realized higher proportional revenue increases from its training division  which operates at significantly lower overall gross margins than its manufacturing segment 
the decrease in gross margins in the mobile security division was primarily due to a less favorable mix of commercial vehicle sales compared to the same period the prior year  a heavier mix of lower margin cash in transit vehicles in compared to  and a larger number of base unit sales included in revenue in the period 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million of total revenues for fiscal compared to million of total revenues for fiscal this increase was primarily due to the operating expenses associated with the operations of the mobile security division  acquired in august  which were not included for the full year ended december  operating expenses also increased in the products division primarily due to operating expenses associated with acquired companies and from internal growth of the business 
operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased because the mobile security division operates with a lower level of operating expenses as a percentage of sales than does the products division 
we expect to see an increase in corporate operating expense during because we will incur significant increases in insurance expenses  government affairs and lobbying efforts  internal audit  information technology and increased legal and accounting costs associated with legal compliance 
amortization 
amortization expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease results from the implementation of sfas  which eliminated goodwill amortization for all acquisitions completed after july   as well as for all fiscal years ending after january  remaining amortization expense is related to patents and trademarks with finite lives

the new credit facility consists of a five year revolving credit facility and  among other things  provides for i total maximum borrowings of million  ii a million sub limit for the issuances of standby and commercial letters of credit  iii a million sub limit for swing line loans  and iv a million sub limit for multi currency borrowings 
all borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at either i a rate equal to libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to  ii an alternate base rate which will be the higher of a the bank of america prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or iii with respect to foreign currency loans  a fronted offshore currency rate  plus an applicable margin ranging from to  depending on certain conditions 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by  among other things  i a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock or other equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries  ii a pledge of of the issued and outstanding voting shares of stock or other voting equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries  iii a pledge of of the issued and outstanding nonvoting shares of stock or other nonvoting equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries  and iv a first priority perfected security interest on certain of our domestic assets and certain domestic assets of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries that will become guarantors of our obligations under the new credit facility  including  among other things  accounts receivable  inventory  machinery  equipment  certain contract rights  intellectual property rights and general intangibles 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our negative and affirmative covenants 
on august   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries  excluding for usds  inc  on a senior subordinated basis 
the notes have been sold to qualified institutional investors in reliance on rule a of the securities act of  as amended  and to non us persons in reliance on regulation s under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were rated b b by moody s investors service and standard poor s rating services  respectively 
during  we used a portion of the funds to acquire simula  inc and hatch imports  inc  and we intend to use the remaining proceeds of the offering to fund acquisitions  repay a portion of our outstanding debt and for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the funding of capital expenditures 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements  designated as a fair value hedge as defined under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge activities  sfas with a notional amount totaling million 
the agreements were entered into to exchange the fixed interest rate on the notes for a variable interest rate equal to six month libor  set in arrears  plus a spread ranging from to fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of february and august 
the agreements are subject to other terms and conditions common to transactions of this type 
in accordance with sfas  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in the market interest rate 
accordingly  the other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  increased by million  which reflected an increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
the corresponding increase in the hedge liability was recorded in long term debt 
the agreements are deemed to be a perfectly effective fair value hedge  and  therefore  qualify for the short cut method of accounting under sfas as a result  no ineffectiveness is expected to be recognized in our earnings associated with the interest rate swap agreements 
in march  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to a maximum million shares of our common stock 
in february  the board of directors increased this stock repurchase program to authorize the repurchase  from time to time depending upon market conditions and other factors  of up to an additional million shares 
through march   we repurchased million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program at an average price of per share  leaving us with the ability to repurchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
repurchases may be made in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
at december   we had million shares of common stock outstanding 
we expect to continue our policy of repurchasing our common stock from time to time  subject to the restrictions contained in our credit facility and our indenture 
our credit facility permits us to repurchase shares of our common stock with no limitation if our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebtida as such terms are defined in the credit facility for any rolling twelve month period is less than to at ratios greater than to  our credit agreement limits our ability to repurchase shares at million 
this basket resets to each time the ratio is less than to working capital  excluding amounts relating to discontinued operations  was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
our fiscal capital expenditures for continuing operations were million 
our fiscal capital expenditures for discontinued operations were million 
such expenditures include leasehold improvements  information technology and communications infrastructure equipment and software  and manufacturing machinery and equipment 
we anticipate that the cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations  cash on hand and available borrowings under the credit facility will enable us to meet liquidity  working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
if such financing is required  there are no assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us or on a basis that is not dilutive to our stockholders

inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our overall interest expense 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our million senior subordinated notes  our credit facilities and our short term monetary investments 
to the extent that  from time to time  we hold short term money market instruments  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates on such instruments 
to that extent  there is inherent rollover risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is no risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments  only a risk related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements in which we effectively exchanged the million fixed rate interest rate on the senior subordinated notes for variable rates in the notional amount of million  million and million at six month libor  set in arrears  plus   and  respectively 
the agreement involves receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the lives of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the variable interest rates are fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of february and august 
the six month libor rate was on february  the maturity dates of the interest rate swap agreements match those of the underlying debt 
our objective for entering into these interest rate swaps was to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of the senior subordinated notes and to obtain variable rate financing at an attractive cost 
changes in the six month libor would affect our earnings either positively or negatively 
an assumed basis point increase in the six month libor would increase our interest obligations under the interest rate swaps by approximately  for a six month period 
in accordance with sfas  we designated the interest rate swap agreements as perfectly effective fair value hedges and  accordingly  use the short cut method of evaluating effectiveness 
as permitted by the short cut method  the change in the fair value of the interest rate swaps will be reflected in earnings and an equivalent amount will be reflected as a change in the carrying value of the swaps  with an offset to earnings 
there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded 
on december   we recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of million and recorded the corresponding fair value adjustment to the senior subordinated notes in the other assets and long term debt sections of the consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
however  counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the risk of loss due to nonperformance is considered by management to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swap agreements or other derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominated in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
where appropriate and to partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments we receive payment from customers in local currencies in amounts sufficient to meet our local currency obligations 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk 
risks associated with international operations we do business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in africa  asia  south america  russia and the former cis 
we have invested substantial resources outside of the united states and plan to continue to do so in the future 
our international operations are subject to the risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us and our operating companies 
we do not have political risk insurance in the countries in which we currently conduct business  but periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to our interests in our operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights 
accordingly  we may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
