item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
while the company bases estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following policies are both important to the reported financial condition and results of operations and require subjective judgements and are  therefore  considered critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to income based on management s evaluation of the probable credit losses presently inherent in its loan portfolio 
this evaluation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  loan classifications  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  portfolio growth and composition and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate loan loss allowance 
loan losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the recovery of principal is unlikely 
if  as a result of loans charged off or increases in the size or risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  the allowance is below the level considered by management to be adequate to absorb future loan losses on existing loans  the provision for loan losses is increased to the level considered necessary to provide an adequate allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible  based on evaluations of the collectibility of the loans 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
economic conditions may result in the necessity to change the allowance quickly in order to react to deteriorating financial conditions of the company s borrowers 
as a result  additional provisions on existing loans may be required in the future if borrowers financial conditions deteriorate or if real estate values decline 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans that exhibit observed or probable credit weakness 
for example  reserves may be specifically assigned for loans that are days or more past due  loans where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy or loans identified by the company s internal loan review process 
reserves are based upon management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
for loans not subject to specific reserve allocations  historical loss rates by loan category are applied 
an unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
reserves on individual loans are reviewed no less frequently than quarterly and adjusted as appropriate 
the company has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in its determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
there have been no material changes in assumptions of estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the allowances  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustments and net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination 
future additions to the company s allowance will be the result of periodic loan  property and collateral reviews and thus cannot be predicted in advance 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the company to record additions to the allowance level based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of examination 
accounting for income taxes in the accounting for income taxes  the company records amounts that represent taxes payable for the current year as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from transactions that have differing effects for financial statements and tax returns 
judgement is required in assessing the future tax effects of transactions that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual tax effects in future years could have an impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations

pennfed has been  and intends to continue to be  a community oriented financial institution offering a variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
the company has full service branch offices in new jersey 
the company attracts deposits from the general public and uses these deposits  together with borrowings and other funds  to originate and purchase one to four family residential mortgage loans  and  to a lesser extent  to originate commercial and multi family real estate and consumer loans 
the company also invests in mortgage backed securities secured by one to four family residential mortgages and us government agency obligations 
through a relationship with an unaffiliated third party  the company offers insurance and uninsured non deposit investment products to the company s customers and members of the general public 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company participates in the ownership of a title insurance agency 
pennfed s loan portfolio growth is dependent primarily on its ability to provide the products and services that meet the needs of the customers in its market area 
the company offers fixed rate  adjustable rate and balloon mortgage loans for residential and commercial purposes  as well as home equity  consumer loans and non mortgage business loans  with a variety of terms 
residential first mortgage loans are the largest part of the portfolio  representing approximately at june  the level of interest rates also has a significant impact on the ability of the company to originate loans 
during the past fiscal year  the company s net loans receivable and loans held for sale increased million 
this increase was primarily attributable to strong loan origination levels and a temporary reduction in the company s loan sale strategy during the second half of fiscal this increase was attained despite the lower level of interest rates during much of the fiscal year  which resulted in a significant amount of loan prepayments and refinances 
also contributing to the increase were purchases of million of one to four family first mortgage loans in fiscal the company also sold million of loans during the fiscal year as a means to manage interest rate risk 
the retention and the recruitment of profitable deposit customers are vital to pennfed s ability to generate liquid funds and to support the growth of non interest income 
although there has been over a reduction in the number of deposit accounts since june   average deposit balances per account  excluding wholesale certificates of deposit  have increased nearly 
the company offers a number of different deposit products and uses this product mix along with a strong focus on customer service to attract customers and to build depositor relationships 
the level of interest rates also has a significant influence on the level of the company s deposits 
during the past fiscal year  deposits increased million despite the decrease in interest rates  primarily due to a million increase in core deposits checking  money market and savings accounts and the addition of million of brokered certificates of deposit 
the increase in core deposits was accomplished through a combination of desirable product features  focused marketing campaigns and competitive interest rates 
pennfed s future loan and deposit growth is to a large extent directly tied in to the level of interest rates 
if interest rates decrease  as they did during much of this past fiscal year  loan prepayments and refinances may outpace the company s ability to originate and purchase replacement loans 
the company s focus would center on maintaining growth in the loan pipeline 
however  the company may also revert to selling new residential loan product in order to manage the risk associated with keeping lower yielding loans on the balance sheet 
if interest rates increase  as they have been during the latter part of the fiscal year  growth in the loan pipeline will depend on the company s ability to agressively seek out customers in spite of the higher cost of residential and commercial borrowing 
with rising interest rates  loan origination volumes would likely be lower than recent years and a reduction in prepayments of loans currently in portfolio would be expected 
as mentioned above  the company has been successful in growing deposits during times of lower interest rates  while increasing interest rates allow the company an additional tool for attracting depositors  some of whom may have removed their deposits when rates were lower 
the company remains confident that by offering competitively priced products and by striving for superior customer service  it will be able to maintain profitable levels of loans and deposits during the coming fiscal year 
cash and cash equivalent balances were at higher levels during portions of the fiscal year  compared to the prior year  due to the funds received from loan repayments and due to the lower yields available on alternative investment options 
despite these lower yields  pennfed added to its mortgage backed and investment securities portfolios during the year in order to replace those securities that prepaid early and to gain interest income above that provided by short term investments 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
the lower level of interest rates experienced during most of the fiscal year negatively impacted pennfed s interest income while reducing its interest expense  when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the company s interest income is primarily driven by interest on residential first mortgage loans  which decreased million during the fiscal year 
the origination of loans with lower yields  the sale of a portion of these lower yielding loans and  in particular  the significant amount of prepayments and refinances of higher yielding loans contributed to the decrease in residential first mortgage interest income 
overall  net interest income decreased million and the net interest margin decreased from to during the fiscal year 
lower cost of funds on deposits due to the interest rate environment and a net decrease in the average balance of deposits due to the runoff of higher costing certificates of deposit was primarily responsible for a decrease of million in interest expense on deposits 
there has been a compression of the net interest margin throughout the fiscal year because there has been little room to further reduce the rates paid on deposits and borrowings  yet a large volume of prepayments of loans and securities  coupled with the lower interest rates  has caused the reinvestment of liquid funds into lower yielding assets 
as interest rates have stabilized and begun to rise slightly during the latter portion of this fiscal year  non interest income has decreased compared to the level seen in the prior year 
loan service fees related to modifications and prepayments were not at the levels seen earlier in the fiscal year or during the prior year  when interest rates caused many customers to refinance their loans or reduce the interest rate of their loans 
as rates began to rise during the year  new loan production reflected the increased interest rates and the company discontinued its loan sale strategy 
the decision to retain all newly originated loans for portfolio was viewed as the best alternative for utilizing excess funds from prepayments 
by retaining loans for portfolio  the company experienced a lower net gain on loan sales for the fiscal year when compared to the prior year 
offsetting the interest rate effects on non interest income  an investment in bank owned life insurance boli  which did not exist in the prior fiscal year  has allowed other non interest income to increase above the level seen in the previous year 
non interest expenses were greater this fiscal year compared to the prior year  when the cost of the prior year s trust preferred securities now included in interest expense is excluded 
non interest expenses were negatively impacted by an increase in the company s stock price during the fiscal year 
the compensation expense related to the employee stock ownership plan esop increased significantly during the year in order to reflect the value of pennfed stock 
the esop expense ceased at the end of this fiscal year  as all shares became fully allocated 
thus  going forward  the company will see a reduction in compensation expense relative to this year  as the benefits replacing the esop will cost the company significantly less 
non interest expense for the current fiscal year also includes a non recurring charge associated with an environmental liability 
see item legal proceedings 
pennfed s future earnings are inherently tied to the level of interest rates that the company will operate under 
if interest rates increase  as they have begun to during the latter part of this fiscal year  the company s interest expense on deposits will increase before the effect will be seen in the company s interest income on loans 
the effect on interest expense is due to the short term repricing characteristics of the company s deposits 
as for interest income  loan commitments will be locked in at rates established before they actually close at a later date 
as interest rates rise  this will result in a lag in the higher rates translating into an increase in interest income 
by emphasizing adjustable rate loan products while also focusing on longer term certificates of deposit and borrowings  which would help lock in a lower cost of funds  pennfed can position itself to mitigate the effects of rising interest rates 
see the section titled management strategy for a discussion of those areas management has emphasized as important to future growth and improved earnings 
management strategy management s primary goal is to enhance stockholder value  while providing our customers with appropriate quality products and services through a continued focus on improved earnings while managing risks  including liquidity and interest rate risk 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing core deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
as a traditional thrift serving our market area  the company will continue to emphasize production of traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in new jersey 
one to four family loans are generally considered to have a lower inherent risk  coupled with a lower yield 
the company produced million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million  respectively  represent loan originations  with the balance representing loan purchases 
as a result of historically low interest rates  refinance activity had been particularly strong throughout fiscal the recent rise in interest rates  coupled with a projected additional increase in rates  is expected to significantly reduce refinance activity as well as cause a slight shift in borrowers preference from fixed to adjustable rate products 
while origination levels may decline  in response to rising rates  the company would also expect a significant decline in prepayments on the existing portfolio 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans  which totaled million  or  of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  interest income on one to four family loans of million represented of total interest on loans 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
the company will continue its emphasis on increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan porfolios 
these loans generally reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   and  commercial and multi family and consumer loans represented  and  respectively  of the total gross loan portfolio 
interest income on commercial and multi family and consumer loans of million represented of total interest on loans for the year ended june  while commercial and consumer loans generally represent higher yielding assets  the company will continue to balance the increased income with the risk inherent in these type of loans as compared to a first lien on a one to four family home 
maintaining asset quality 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio consists of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
in recognition of the company s strong underwriting standards and aggressive collection efforts on all loan portfolios  the company s historical loss experience and net chargeoffs continue to be low 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at june  increasing core deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
the company will continue to emphasize growth in core deposits consisting of checking  money market and savings accounts 
these deposits provide a stable  low cost source of funds as well as provide service charge income 
the company utilizes various techniques to generate these types of deposits including special promotional rates and offerings 
for example  during fiscal  the company introduced a free checking account for customers 
the company recognizes the importance of building relationship customers 
therefore  certain higher rates have been offered on certificates of deposit for customers who also maintain checking accounts 
this fiscal year  advertising was increased and expanded to include radio  billboard and bus shelter media in addition to traditional newspaper promotion 
expanding the retail branch network will also aid in growing core deposits 
during the current fiscal year  the bank expanded its retail franchise by opening three new branches 
in september  the company opened its nd branch  located in the ironbound section of newark 
in february  the bank s rd branch was opened in union  new jersey 
finally  in june  the bank s newest branch was opened a full service branch located in west caldwell 
core deposits increased million  or  in fiscal managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than monthly to develop  implement and review strategies and policies to manage interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized core deposit growth  utilized intermediate longer term borrowings and has  at select times  emphasized growth in longer term certificates of deposit 
furthermore  the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan products  including focus on the production of loans with adjustable rate features and or loans with shorter terms to maturity 
in an effort to manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates  the company continually evaluates the sale of longer term  fixed rate  one to four family residential loan production 
during the year ended june   approximately million of primarily conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market and to other institutions as part of the company s efforts to manage interest rate risk 
from time to time sales have been temporarily suspended under certain circumstances 
for example  during the second half of fiscal  loan sales were reduced until the excess cash from loan prepayments was utilized 
the level of loan sale activity continues to be actively evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
see interest rate sensitivity and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company has sought and will continue to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
total service charges and other non interest income  excluding the net gain on sales of loans and real estate operations  reflected a  or  decrease for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to decreases in loan prepayment and modification fees partially offset by income from the company s investment in boli 
as mentioned above  increasing core deposits should result in an increase in service charge income 
as prepayments and refinance activity is expected to drop during the next fiscal year  related income would also decline 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which includes ongoing reviews of staffing levels  facilities and operations 
due to the full allocation of shares under the company s esop at june   future non interest expense is expected to decrease 
during fiscal  esop expense was million 
modifications to the bank s existing benefit plans after june  are expected to cost less than of the fiscal expense level of the esop 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the residential lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board of directors reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s interest sensitive financial instruments 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
investment securities available for sale are assumed to reprice within one year due to the characteristics associated with the underlying assets of the mutual fund 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year if their stated interest rates are at or above current market rates 
if the stated interest rate is below current market rates  these callable securities are assumed to be called at an estimated average life of approximately years 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes that variable rate savings account balances decay gradually over time 
based on historical information  of these balances roll off within one year  roll off in the second year  roll off in the third year  and roll off each year thereafter 
during fiscal and  the bank promoted savings for life accounts  which totaled million at june  these deposits are assumed to have an average life of approximately years 
in addition  a through june savings account was also promoted during fiscal at june   the balance in these accounts totaled million 
these deposits were repriced to on july  and are assumed to roll off within the next months and over the following three years 
the remainder is assumed to have an average life of years 
at june   million  or  of savings accounts are assumed to roll off after five years 
transaction accounts  excluding money market accounts  are assumed to roll off after five years 
money market accounts are assumed to be variable accounts and are reported as repricing within six months 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit

the company s gap has shifted to its more traditional negative position with the recent rise in market rates 
higher mortgage rates have resulted in the maturity extension of residential loans as prepayment estimates have declined and a larger portion of projected cashflows have extended beyond one year 
in addition  higher market rates have lengthened the projected maturity of certain investment securities with callable features beyond three years 
furthermore  the short term estimated cash flows of the company s interest bearing liabilities increased due to an increase in medium term borrowings maturing within one year and the repricing of higher yielding savings accounts in july partially offsetting the effect from these items was an increase in core deposits 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of interest rate gap analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored by management through additional interest rate risk irr measures  including an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
assumptions used in calculating interest rate sensitivity are periodically reviewed and modified as appropriate 
as of june   due to historically low interest rate levels  the effect of a decrease in interest rates could not be simulated 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure  was negative 
as of june   the company s internally generated initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was negative 
as of june   the bank s post shock npv ratio and sensitivity measure were and a positive  respectively  and the company s post shock npv ratio and sensitivity measure were and a positive  respectively 
while the post shock ratios have improved from the prior year  at june  the company had more interest rate sensitivity 
the greater sensitivity is attributable to an extension of the life of assets and a shortening of the life of liabilities 
the duration of assets has increased principally due to reduced prepayment estimates 
conversely  the duration of liabilities has shortened principally due to a rise in short term fundings  both wholesale and retail 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions  including discount and decay rates  and generally result in lower levels of presumed interest rate risk than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the bank with the ots  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of march  the latest date for which information is available  the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was  the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was negative 
in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would decrease from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
although interest rates are not expected to rise immediately  interest rate projections over the next year assume a rise in interest rates and a tightening of the rate spread between the month us treasury bill and the year us treasury bond 
if short term rates rise more quickly than long term rates  interest rate risk measures would improve but earnings would be negatively affected 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years   and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years  which have shorter durations than year fixed rate mortgage loans 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically sold a portion of its one to four family mortgage loan portfolio in an effort to shorten its average life and duration  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
the level of such activity continues to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate and longer term borrowings  subject to market conditions 
the company has focused on the retention and the recruitment of profitable deposit customers in an effort to improve funding stability and earnings 
the company has also emphasized growth in core deposit accounts as these funds are relatively stable  have a longer duration and assist in strengthening customer relationships 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was employed to manage the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
historically low market rates remained throughout the first half of fiscal  resulting in strong prepayments on residential one to four family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  the early redemption of us government agency securities with callable features  and increased levels of short term federal funds investments 
furthermore  loan sale activities  designed to reduce portfolio balances of low coupon  longer term residential loans  added to excess liquidity levels and reduced the duration of the company s assets 
in december  however  loan sale activities were temporarily suspended to manage short term investments and prevent further shrinkage in the portfolio of one to four family residential loans 
to further reduce the higher cash position  premier pricing of retail certificates of deposit was avoided and  instead  significant focus was placed on generating new and building existing core deposit and business relationships particularly in conjunction with the opening of the company s three newest branches 
the low market rate environment also extended a portion of the company s one time convertible fhlb of new york advance portfolio to its final maturity 
together  core deposit growth and the extension of wholesale funding maturities resulted in an increase in the duration of the company s liabilities 
during this period  the company s internally generated npv measurements reflected modest sensitivity to rising market rates 
in the second half of fiscal  concerns of higher short term market rates  associated with a perceived shift in federal monetary policy began to emerge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  longer term market rates rose sharply in response to strong economic data and the expectation of a measured increase in the federal funds rate 
asset duration increased as mortgage prepayment expectations fell and us government agency securities with callable features extended to maturity 
furthermore  the perceived threat of higher rates resulted in a significant increase in one to four family mortgage application activity  as borrowers desired to lock in lower market rates 
in addition  a portion of the company s fhlb advances and reverse repurchase agreements  purchased several years ago  matured and was replaced by deposits and other borrowings at a significantly reduced cost of funds 
by fiscal year end  the company s short term investment portfolio was eliminated 
the longer asset duration combined with increased funding needs  met partially through short term borrowings  has led to higher internally generated npv ratios and an increase in price sensitivity to rising market rates 
as a result of the above activity  one to four family mortgage loan balances increased million between june  and june  due to the historically low interest rate levels  adjustable rate balances fell million while fixed rate balances increased million 
nevertheless  approximately of the fiscal fixed rate loan originations were for terms less than years or for bi weekly products 
consumer loan balances increased million 
prime based home equity lines of credit increased million while other consumer products  principally fixed rate second mortgages generally with shorter durations than one to four family residential mortgages  decreased million 
the commercial and multi family real estate loan portfolio grew million during the current fiscal year with adjustable rate products declining million and fixed rate loans rising million 
at june   medium and long term certificate of deposit balances with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million  including million of wholesale certificates of deposit  compared to million at june  there were no wholesale certificates of deposit at june  certificate of deposit balances  excluding brokered deposits  declined million as premium pricing was avoided  but was offset by a million increase in core deposit balances 
checking and money market account balances fell million  while savings balances increased million 
wholesale borrowings with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million at june   reflecting a decline of million during the current fiscal year
