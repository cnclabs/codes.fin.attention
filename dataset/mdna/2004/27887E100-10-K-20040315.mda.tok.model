overview ecollege has historically been a leading outsource provider of elearning solutions for post secondary online degree programs 
with the acquisition of datamark on october   we have expanded to become a leading outsource provider of value added information services to the post secondary market 
we focus our growth on information based products and services  in particular  those services which focus on the lifeblood of our customers their students 
the student life cycle starts with lead generation and continues through enrollment  student services  retention  instruction  and ultimately through job placement and continuing education 
the datamark acquisition marks a transformation for ecollege from being solely a leading elearning information service provider to being a supplier of a broader array of value added information services aimed at lead generation  lead conversion or enrollment  and retention services and online distance education programs 
while the overall economic environment has been challenging over the last couple of years for many industries  the for profit education market has continued to experience growth 
ecollege s net revenue was million in as compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase in net revenue reflects the increase in revenue generated from new products and solutions as a result of the datamark acquisition  as well as an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
total ecourse student enrollments increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
student fees have become the majority of our total elearning revenue as the number of online courses offered by our customers and the number of students enrolled in those courses delivered on our course management platform continues to increase while the revenue generated by our online campus and course development services has declined 
we expect this trend in our elearning division revenue mix will continue in the future 
with the acquisition of datamark  we also expect that enrollment marketing services will generate a greater percent of our total revenue 
because we only include the revenue earned by datamark since october  acquisition date in our consolidated statements of operations  enrollment marketing related revenue only represented of our total revenue in  while we expect it to represent approximately of total revenue in on a pro forma basis  assuming we had included datamark s revenue of million for the entire year of  instead of the million actually included for the two months after acquisition  enrollment marketing revenue would have represented approximately of this pro forma revenue in as well 
we became profitable in through the realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses as our student fee revenue increased  improved utilization of our professional services and consulting staff as we continued to improve the technology and business processes used in our operations  and the improved cost control of our other operating expenses despite increase in total costs 
in august  the company completed a private placement of million shares of ecollege common stock with a group of institutional investors  including several then current stockholders  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the majority of the net proceeds of this equity issuance was used to fund the datamark acquisition 
to further finance the datamark acquisition  we issued debt with principal totaling million 
the majority of our debt is not due until however due to the accounting treatment given to certain components of the debt we issued  our results of operations will include a significant amount of non cash interest expense in and in the future 
senior subordinated notes issued to a bank and subordinated notes issued to the sellers  with principal tot aling million and million  respectively  had estimated fair values of million and million  respectively  at december  the resulting discounts will result in interest expense amortized over the term of these debt obligations 
under the current financing arrangements as of december   million of debt will be due in the next three years with million due within the subsequent two year period 
the significant amount of debt at december  could make it more difficult or expensive for us to raise additional capital  if needed in the future 
our acquisition of datamark has affected the comparability of our results as well as the complexity of our financial statements 
as a result  in order to understand and compare our business  management reviews operating results before interest income and expense and non cash charges primarily related to depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and capitalized software  and stock based compensation 
our primary lenders have also identified this measurement as a key indicator of our performance within our bank debt covenants 
for the year ended december   we incurred depreciation expense of million  amortization of intangible assets resulting from the datamark acquisition of  amortization of capitalized software costs of million  stock based compensation of  and interest expense net of interest income of million 
since the datamark acquisition occurred on october   at which point we entered into our current debt agreements  all of the amortization of intangible assets and the majority of our interest expense for was incurred in the final two months of the year 
accordingly  we expect that these expenses will be significantly higher in when we will incur twelve months of these expenses 
elearning division overview we provide outsourced technology  products and services that enable colleges  universities  and k schools to offer an online environment for distance  on campus  and hybrid learning 
our technology enables our customers to reach a large number of students who wish to take courses at convenient times and locations via the internet 
our customers can also use our technology to supplement their on campus courses with an online learning environment or as a hybrid solution by substituting a portion of their campus learning with online components 
we offer services to assist in the development of online programs  including online course and campus design and development  faculty training and support  and technical consulting 
as part of our core solution we provide access to software  hosting  product advancement  quality assurance  program administration support  and student and faculty technical help desk 
our primary source of elearning revenue is student technology service fees we charge to our customers for each enrollment in their online courses delivered on our cms 
since our inception  our customers have had approximately million student enrollments in online courses or course supplements 
in total  our customers have developed approximately  unique online courses and course supplements on our platform 
elearning revenue grew in and in the increase in revenue for both years is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
total student fees represented million  million  and million of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively  which translates into increases of in both and enrollment division overview datamark is an outsource provider of integrated enrollment marketing services to the proprietary post secondary school market 
we offer comprehensive solutions to increase student enrollment leads  conversion rates  and retention rates of our customers and therefore the customers corresponding revenue 
we provide full service research and direct marketing for colleges and proprietary schools  offering comprehensive marketing solutions that include direct mail  online  television  and other media solutions 
we also offer lead conversion systems and training to enhance the performance of a school s admissions staff  as well as post lead communication campaigns to increase the number of leads that actually convert into enrollments 
our retention marketing products and services include a s uite of tools for identifying at risk students  communication plans to help those students stay in school and monitoring and response plans to keep track of students as they progress through the program 
datamark s lead generation services  consisting primarily of targeted direct response marketing using mail and internet based solutions as well as media placement services  generates most of the division s revenue 
datamark s focus historically has been on increasing student enrollments at its customers on campus locations  however its marketing solutions are also applicable for customers online programs and our elearning customers have indicated a desire for ecollege to provide student acquisition and retention services 
the new enrollment division represented million of our consolidated revenue in  primarily from the direct mail marketing services completed in november and december which accounted for million 
our consolidated revenue also includes million of other revenue from our enrollment division  including  from interactive or internet based marketing services and  from media placement activities 
objectives and strategy our objectives are to continue to expand our presence within our target market of for profit higher education companies and proprietary post secondary schools  colleges  universities  and k schools in the united states and canada by being a supplier of a broad array of value added information services aimed at the student life cycle 
we have been very focused on achieving profitability with the cash proceeds we generated from our initial public offering in december we achieved that goal by pursuing a niche strategy  focused on being an outsource provider of the technology and services that educational institutions need to fuel the growth of large  online  distance degree programs 
many of those institutions are in the for profit post secondary market or among more entrepreneurially inclined not for profit schools 
in january of  we began looking to accelerate our growth and mitigate the risks associated with a niche strategy 
we designed a strategy based upon the following premise we participate in one of the most attractive segments of the united states economy  the high growth proprietary and continuing education sectors of the post secondary education market 
therefore  we wanted to pursue new products and services that could enhance our position within these sectors 
strategically  the datamark acquisition broadens our market position in the for profit post secondary education market that we already serve through our elearning division 
it also increases the service offerings we have along the student life cycle 
with the new offerings from datamark  such as enrollment marketing  admissions training  and retention improvement solutions  as well as the potential for new integrated products between our enrollment and elearning divisions in the future  we can strengthen our relationships with our customers in that sector 
the primary operating benefits of the datamark acquisition will be cross selling to each other s customer base and offering new products and services to the post secondary education market 
selling enrollment marketing services to our combined customer base should also increase datamark s revenue and increase the growth of ecollege s elearning student technology service fees 
in the past  we have analyzed numerous potential acquisitions and will continue to do so in the future  as we look to expand our value added information service offering for the post secondary education market 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for the issuance of debt obligations  valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  software development costs  and income taxes are all critical accounting policies for our company 
these policies have been discussed with  and are evaluated by  our board of directors audit committee and independent auditors and are substantially consistent with the policies in effect during a change in one of our accounting policies that occurred during was the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation using the prospective method for the year ended december  but effective january  in addition  due to the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded and the debt we issued in conjunction with the datamark acquisition  we have determined that accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets and debt obligations are critical accounting policies 
each of the policies is discussed in detail in the following section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy for our company  as it primarily affects the timing of when we recognize the fees we charge our customers for our services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance on revenue recognition for public companies 
elearning we enter into contracts with our customers to provide our online learning products and services 
our contracts typically have initial terms of one to five years  with the average being approximately three years 
each contract specifies the type and price of the online campus purchased and the number and price of online courses purchased  as well as the fees for student enrollments and any other products or services purchased 
since our customer contracts are generally applicable campus wide  colleges and universities can add new online programs and schools without the need to negotiate new contract terms 
the majority of our elearning division revenue is earned by charging a per enrollment student technology service fee to our customers for access to their ecourses and our help desk 
we also offer a pricing model for our ecompanion product under which we charge an annual license fee for up to a predetermined number of users 
for our program administrative solutions  we generally charge a one time set up and design fee to implement an online campus  and an annual license  hosting  and maintenance fee for access to our software 
we sell our course development services on a per course basis while our other professional consulting services are based on our standard hourly rates 
we also offer our customers the option to purchase blocks of course development service hours  based on our stan dard hourly rates 
student fees are recognized on a straight line basis over each course s specific academic term or over the length of the student fee license purchased by the customer  depending upon contract terms 
campus license  hosting  and maintenance fees  including the design and development of a customer s campus  are recognized on a straight line basis from the campus launch date through the end of the relevant contract period or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is greater 
the average recognition period for these campus fees is approximately three years 
course development fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the approximate period over which our services are provided and our obligation to the customer is fulfilled 
if a customer has purchased a block of course design and development consulting hours  we recognize such hourly fees as the work is performed 
if a customer has contracted with us to build a unique online course  in general  we recognize such fees over a period of nine months  which approximates the length of time over which we complete our work and fulfill our obligations to the customer 
during and prior periods  this performance period for course development services was estimated to be twelve months from the date the course was ordered by the customer 
effective january   we began to recognize such fe es over a nine month recognition period  based upon changes in our experience of providing such services 
we believe that this change more accurately reflects the period over which the services are currently delivered 
the period over which we perform the services and therefore recognize the revenue may change in the future as our actual experience in completing development obligations continues to evolve 
changes in our contract terms and expected customer life may also affect the period over which campus and course development fees are recognized in the future 
all other revenue sources are recognized at the time of the performance of the service eg  training  instructional design  and technical consulting or over the length of the service period eg  annual evaluation solutions license fees 
enrollment our enrollment division revenues are primarily generated from the sale of direct mail  interactive marketing  and media placement 
we also derive revenue from research services  admissions training  and retention services 
it is our practice to execute contracts or work orders of various lengths  typically up to three months for one project  for direct mail advertising campaigns 
individual direct mail projects typically take to business days to complete with payments due two days before marketing materials are mailed 
fees are determined based on the number of pieces mailed and the associated revenue is recognized when the marketing materials are mailed 
our pricing and revenue for direct mailings that we complete for our customers includes all applicable postage costs 
interactive media arrangements usually last from three months to one year in length 
our pricing is based on a fee per lead generated model  with an initial up front payment due at the time the customer s agreement is signed and then the customer is invoiced monthly thereafter based on the number of leads generated 
payments received are recorded as customer advances liability until the leads are generated at which point the revenue is recognized 
it is generally our practice to execute written master services agreements  signed by both the customer and datamark  for clients for whom we provide media buying services 
we also execute an agency of record letter  which identifies datamark as the agent authorized to make media placements on behalf of the customer 
smaller clients are not required to execute master service agreements but are required to sign the agency of record letter 
we charge our customer for the cost of the advertisement placed with the third party media supplier eg newspaper  television  radio station  etc 
which generally includes a commission 
revenue is recognized when the media advertisements are run by the third party media supplier 
revenue is recorded on a net basis  meaning that we only include the commission portion of the amount we charge in our consolidated revenue  not the gross amount of fees charged to  and collected from  our customers 
accordingly  we also exclude the direct cost of the advertisement charged by the media supplier from our cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we determined that revenue should be recorded on a net basis based on the fact that the third party media supplier and not datamark is responsible for ultimate fulfillment  including the acceptability of the products or services purchased by a customer  and therefore datamark does not have risks and rewards as principal in the media placement transactions 
furthermore  the fact that we earn a stated percentage of the amount billed to a customer is an indication that datamark is in effect acting as an agent only 
other enrollment marketing revenue sources include retention services  admissions training  and research services 
student retention services agreements are contracted for a period of not less than months and typically for a period of one year 
we charge a fee based on the number of students actively enrolled in a particular month 
there is also a one time fee for implementation of our retention product that is recognized as revenue over the contract period 
contracts for admissions training and research services are negotiated based on scope of work 
these services are provided on an hourly rate and are recognized at the time of the performance of the service or over the length of the service period 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy for our company due primarily to the significant judgment required when estimating the fair value of the stock based compensation awards  including the selection of a valuation method eg black scholes and the underlying assumptions within such valuation eg estimated lives outstanding and volatility of the awards 
currently  generally accepted accounting principles provide two methods for accounting for employee stock option plans and other employee stock based compensation arrangements 
companies may recognize stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value based method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  or under a fair value based method prescrib ed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and related interpretations 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options granted to employees and directors and other stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 we generally did not record any stock based compensation expense for options granted to employees  provided the options had an exercise price equal to or above the market price of our common stock and the ultimate number of shares to be issued upon exercise were fixed on the day the option was granted 
as such  we recognized compensation expense for stock options only if the quoted market value of the company s common stock exceeded the exercise price of the option on the grant date 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  for our employee stock option plans and other employee stock based compensation arrangements using the prospective method under sfas no 
this method applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all employee stock awards granted  modified  or settled after january   and accordingly  we recognized compensation expense for such awards made under our stock based employee compensation plans 
the fair values of restricted share rights were determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  while stock options were estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
both types of awards estimated fair values are being amortized over the vesting perio d of the applicable award  generally years 
as a result  the company recorded  of total stock based compensation expense in  including approximately  of additional expense directly related to the adoption of sfas no 
when compared to what would have been recorded under apb no 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company s quarterly results of operations for the first nine months of were restated to reflect the additional expense associated with stock based awards 
the additional expense recognized in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
was   and  for the three months ended march   june   and september   respectively 
for stock awards granted prior to january   compensation expense has not been recognized under sfas n o 
 in accordance with the prospective method of adoption allowed for under sfas no 
the company s use of the prospective method of adoption means that the fair value for stock based compensation required by sfas no 
was applied only to stock based compensation awards granted  modified  or settled in accordingly  results are not directly comparable to prior years results in this regard 
however  as required by sfas no 
 we do present pro forma disclosures of our net income loss using the fair value based accounting model for awards granted prior to january   as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
stock options issued to non employees as consideration for services provided to the company have been and continue to be accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all such options 
debt obligations in october  the company financed a portion of the purchase of datamark with million face value in senior subordinated secured notes senior subordinated notes issued to a lender and million face value subordinated seller notes seller notes 
the senior subordinated notes have principal payments due in million quarterly increments beginning on december   with interest payments due quarterly beginning on december   at a rate of per annum 
the seller notes  with interest and principal due in  are comprised of a series of notes issued to the selling stockholders of datamark  aggregating to million  with an interest rate of per annum  simple interest  and another series of notes issued to the selling stockholders of datamark  a ggregating to million  with an interest rate of  interest compounded annually 
even though the company will not pay interest and principal on the seller notes until  interest expense will be incurred each year until the payments are made 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company was required to estimate the fair value of the senior subordinated notes and the seller notes 
the fair value of the senior subordinated notes was million at december  the fair value of the senior subordinated notes reflects the estimated fair value of the warrants issued in connection with this debt see further discussion of warrants in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a significant amount of judgement was involved in management s estimation of the fair value of the warrants eg using the black scholes valuation model  estimated volatility and an expected life of the warrants 
the estimated fair value of the warrants at the date of issuance was million  and was recorded as a debt discount against the face value of the million senior subordinated notes 
this discount will be amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes using the interest method 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
the fair value of the seller notes was million at december  the fair value of the seller notes was determined by an independent third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of our senior subordinated notes  and other comparable debt securities 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
due to the discounts recorded when the senior subordinated notes and seller notes were issued  any pre payments of these debt obligations would likely result in a significant amount of interest expense  since cash paid would exceed the carrying amount for accounting purposes 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of datamark in october  we recorded a significant portion of the approximate million purchase price as goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions require significant judgement in terms of establishing their fair value  determining appropriate amortization periods  and assessing such intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in the future 
it is possible that our review of such intangible assets in the future could determine that they are impaired and the amount of such impairment could be significant 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the net of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed in acquisitions 
the company applied sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in october and  in accordance with sfas no 
 there is no amortization of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives 
however  such assets are tested for impairment annually 
there is a significant amount of judgement involved in estimating the fair value and useful lives of the identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the fair value of the intangible assets were recorded based upon valuations determined by an independent third party using the income and cost methods at the date of acquisition 
the income method determines a value based on estimated future cash flows and the cost method determines value based on what it would cost to replace the asset  minus depreciation and depletion in some cases 
goodwill and the identified intangible assets with indefinite and finite useful lives were not impaired at december  the estimated lives of the intangible assets were also determined by the independent third party using the facts known at the time of the acquisition 
customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of years  and non compete agreements are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
the datamark trade name has been deemed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization expense  but instead is subject to annual impairment tests 
in determining that the trade name has an indefinite life  the company considered the following factors the ongoing active use of its trade name  the lack of any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the trade name  the lack of any substantial costs to maintain the asset  the positive impact on its trade name generated by its other ongoing business activities including marketing and development of new technology and new products  and its commitment to products branded with its trade name over its corporate history 
the company s acquired trade name has significant market recognition and the company expects to derive benefits from the use of this asset beyond the foreseeable future 
however  should the company discontinue use of or otherwise determine that its value is diminished  the company may be required to impair all or a significant portion of this asset 
software development costs the determination of the point at which capitalization of qualifying costs properly commences is subject to a high degree of management judgment 
on april   we started to capitalize software development costs related to our campusportal product 
the technology developed for this product serves as the infrastructure to our campus and course management systems  thereby supporting our campus development revenue and indirectly student technology service fee line 
as of march   we had capitalized million of costs related to development of this product 
in april  the software was determined to be ready for its intended use  and accordingly  we began amortizing the capitalized costs over a useful life of three years 
we did not capitalize any additional software development costs during or through december   we had recorded million of accumulated amortization  and therefore have approximately  of capitalized software development costs remaining to be amortized 
we anticipate that the remaining capitalized software development costs will be fully amortized as of march  amortization expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and  respectively 
in general  the company has expensed current costs for the development of internal use software as incurred due to the fact that the costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant and the related lives are short 
income taxes income taxes consist of federal  state and local taxes 
accounting for income taxes and any related valuation allowance requires the application of significant judgment and estimates 
we incurred significant losses since our inception through december  resulting in approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in varying amounts beginning in however  utilization of such prospective net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations  such as limitations resulting from significant changes in ownership 
in addition  income taxes may be payable during this time  due to operating income in certain tax jurisdictions which cannot be offset by operating loss carryforwards 
if we have taxable income and the net operating loss carryforw ards are not available  because they have been limited by tax law  been exhausted or have expired  we may be liable for significant taxes payable 
in july  we engaged an independent tax services firm to conduct an analysis of the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards  and we determined that our net operating loss carryforward will be limited by approximately million in and million in  barring any significant change in ownership or tax laws 
we have not recorded any provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes during the year ended december   as we believe any tax liability incurred during this period would be offset by the benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards  and because  as discussed below  we have not yet determined that the realization of the deferred tax asset will be achieved  on a more likely than not basis 
we have established a valuation allowance against the entire amount of our net deferred tax asset of million as of december   because we have not been able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax asset under the applicable accounting requirements for such assets  due primarily to our history of operating losses 
approximately million of our deferred tax assets  as well as the associated valuation allowance  relate to tax benefits from stock based compensation 
in future periods  we will continue to assess our deferred tax assets for realizability 
should we conclude that these deferred tax assets are entirely or partially realizable  the valuation allowance will be reversed to the extent of such estimated realizability 
to the extent the company reverses the valuation allowance with respect to the tax benefit from stock based compensation  the company would record the deferred tax assets with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the reversal  if any  of the remaining valuation allowance would be recognized as deferred income tax benefit  and accordingly an increase to our net income per share in the period of reversal  in our consolidated statement of operations  with a corresponding deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
in future years  we will continue to assess our deferred tax assets for recoverability  which will require significant judgement on behalf of our management 
description of significant components of our consolidated statement of operations revenue over the past three years  ecollege primarily generated revenue from its elearning student technology fees for students enrolled in online courses and online course supplements 
we also recognized a smaller portion of elearning revenue from online campus and course design and development services including licensing and hosting services fees for online campuses  and other professional consulting activities 
with the acquisition of datamark in october  we started to generate revenue through a variety of other products and services including direct mail  media placement services  and interactive marketing 
of these lead generation services  direct mail accounted for of the total enrollment marketing revenue we recognized in we also recognized a smaller portion of enrollment marketing revenue from custom research  admissions training  and student retention services 
we expect approximately of our revenue in will be generated from the new enrollment division while will come from our elearning division 
cost of revenue our elearning cost of revenue consists primarily of employee compensation and benefits for our account management  online campus development  course design  technical personnel  and help desk departments as well as sales commissions 
our cost of revenue also includes software  hardware  and other direct costs associated with maintaining our data center operations  and our network infrastructure 
amortization of capitalized software development costs are also included in cost of revenue 
we expect a decrease in cost of revenue of approximately  per quarter  beginning in april  assuming no additional software development costs are capitalized 
in addition  we allocate a portion of our occupancy and infrastructure costs to cost of revenue 
our enrollment division s cost of revenue includes postage costs  raw material costs  including paper and ink  as well as all costs associated with the purchase license of mailing lists 
it also includes direct labor costs and contract production costs 
the majority of the division s purchased materials for direct mail are paper  ink  and postage 
both paper and ink are readily available from numerous suppliers at similar prices 
due to overall declines in demand in the paper market  paper prices during the past few years have remained relatively flat 
sales commissions are recorded as revenue is recognized 
sales representatives also receive additional commissions for achieving significant goals such as signing large customers and increasing program offerings within current customers 
these additional commissions are recorded upon contract signing 
gross profit as our product mix continues to change and diversify  we expect that the mix of our cost of revenue will change accordingly 
we have been able to achieve increases in our revenue without increasing our cost of revenue proportionally 
in  our revenue increased and our cost of revenue decreased as a percent of revenue 
however  datamark s gross margins have historically been lower than those of our elearning division s gross margins 
therefore  while we expect our gross profits to increase in terms of absolute dollars in  we expect to have a gross margin of approximately to for as compared to the realized in product development product development includes costs of maintaining  developing  creating  and improving our online solutions and software products 
these costs consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  consulting fees  occupancy  and depreciation expenses 
due to the nature of the enrollment division s business  we did not incur product development related costs in and we do not expect to incur material product development costs in however  we do expect our development costs to increase in from the level incurred in  as we continue to develop new products to respond to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in january  the company decided  based on timing and cost considerations  to supplement our development efforts by committing resources to offs hore development in sri lanka 
ecollege entered into an agreement with a third party to provide software development and related support services for non critical development projects 
product development costs in the future may be reduced by any software development costs which are capitalized in accordance with relevant accounting standards 
selling and marketing the principal components of our selling and marketing expenses in both divisions are employee compensation and benefits  advertising  industry conferences  and travel 
other significant components include marketing collaterals and direct mailings  consulting fees  occupancy  and depreciation expenses 
we expect our total selling and marketing expenses to increase in  primarily due to the acquisition of datamark in late general and administrative both divisions have general and administrative departments which include finance  legal  human resources  corporate facilities  internal technical network administration and support  management information systems  and executives 
employee compensation and benefits represent the most significant component of general and administrative expense 
other components include rent  depreciation  communications  insurance  and professional and consulting fees 
although we expect to achieve some cost synergies from the acquisition of datamark  we expect that our total general and administrative expenses will increase in amortization of intangible assets our amortization of intangible assets consists entirely of the amortization of our identified intangible assets which we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of years  and non compete agreements are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
the datamark trade name has been deemed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization expense  however if facts and circumstances were to change to cause management to determine that this intangible asset does have a finite life that can be estimated  we would record an associated amortization expense within this expense caption 
in addition  if we were to determine that the recorded goodwill and or the identified inta ngible assets with indefinite and finite useful lives were partially or fully impaired at a future reporting date  all associated impairment expense would be recorded as an operating expense  and impact our reported results of operations 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of our interest expense associated with our various debt obligations 
it also includes our interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents 
results of operations and future outlook in  we achieved many milestones  including recording positive net income and experiencing significant revenue growth 
we believe that our revenue growth will continue in primarily based upon the broadening of product offerings achieved with the datamark acquisition and growth in student technology service fees  as our current customers add more online students and we add new customers from our target market 
based on our current projections  we expect revenue in to range from million to million  an increase of approximately from our total revenue  which includes only two months of datamark s results 
of this amount  approximately of revenue is expected to come from the enrollment division  and approximately of revenue to come from the elearning division 
revenue is expected to increase each quarter throughout the year 
we expect our gross profits to increase in terms of absolute dollars  however  we expect our gross margin percentage will decrease as datamark s gross margins have historically been lower than the margins of our elearning division 
we expect our development costs to increase approximately million in from million incurred in as we continue to develop new products and commit resources to our supplemental offshore development initiative 
we anticipate our selling  marketing  and general administration costs will increase by approximately due primarily to the inclusion of datamark s operations for a full year in within these cost of revenue and operating expense projections  we have included our expectation of approximately million of stock based compensation expense that will not require any cash settlement on the company s part 
also included are the anticipated million of expenses related to depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and capitalized software costs 
since the datamark acquisition occurred on october   at which point we entered into our current debt agreements  all of the amortization of intangible assets and the majority of our interest expense in was incurred in the final two months of accordingly in  we expect that these expenses will be between to million when we will incur twelve months of these expenses  rather than just two months 
specifically  we expect million in amortization of our identified intangible assets 
interest expense associated with the amortization of the discounts on the principal values of the senior subordinated notes and the seller notes and interest expense associated with the amortization of debt issuance costs is expected to be approximately million in total d uring however  due to the nature of these charges  we do not expect to have any cash outlays related to such expenses during we also do not expect to pay approximately million in interest expense during related to the seller notes  since no interest payments are required until in addition  we expect to incur an additional million of interest expense that is payable in  therefore total interest expense is expected to be million to million in based on these projections and estimates we expect income from operations  prior to other income and interest expense  to range from million to million in and net income to range from million to million  excluding any income tax provision or benefit for income taxes 
these estimates are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
historical results the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december    and these results include datamark s results of operations from october   the date on which we acquired all of the outstanding stock of datamark  inc the inclusion of datamark s results for the two months ended december  cause significant fluctuations in the historical operating results of ecollege in as compared to and years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the new enrollment division was responsible for million of this increase  primarily from the direct mail marketing services completed in november and december which accounted for million 
the remaining million of the increase in revenue is primarily due to million increase in student fees from online courses and an increase in other revenue of million  offset by decline in campus and course fees of million 
total student fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
our elearning customers benefit from volume discounts on their student technology fees based on the success of their distance programs 
in addition  they often guarantee a minimum amount of student technology fees for each year they are under contract with us  for which they receive further discounts on our services 
therefore  as we expected  the increase in our student fee revenue was not directly proportional to the increase in our customers online student enrollments in student enrollments in ecourses increased to  from  in the prior year  while the corresponding revenue earned from distance enrollme nts increased to million from million in we expect this trend of enrollment growth outpacing revenue growth to continue in student enrollments in our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to  from  in the prior year 
however  total revenue recognized from such supplements increased during to million from million in  due primarily to our pricing program offered to customers with commitments to significant online distance education programs 
in order to enhance our current customer relationships and further penetrate the distance education market  we feel it is important to develop a greater presence in the lower margin  on campus market for key customers 
on campus usage is important to us because we want our customers on campus faculty and students to be comfortable with our platform so that they will be more likely to teach  or take  fully online course s and thereby drive more ecourse enrollment fees for us 
for that reason  we offer the previously mentioned pricing scenario that is designed to make our product and service offerings more attractive for both on campus and distance education programs 
as evidenced by the enrollment growth in the on campus ecompanion course supplements from to  a number of our large customers have implemented our system on an enterprise wide basis as opposed to solely in their online distance programs 
however  due to our pricing strategy  our revenue from our online course supplement product has not grown in direct proportion to the enrollment growth 
we expect this trend to continue in campus and course fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing  and hosting online campuses for different customers during  down from the customers that had online campuses in we ve implemented a strategy to focus and serve customers who either have or have the potential to have large online programs  therefore we ve seen a decrease in the number of customers from which we ve only been earning campus fees 
there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were individual courses developed by our professionals 
this compares to  and  respectively in howe ver  in we sold our course development services on an hourly basis more often than on a per course basis  as was our past practice 
despite this change in how we sell our source development services  we have seen and expect to continue to see more customers self design and develop online courses  resulting in lower revenue from our course development services 
our course development fees have declined as our customers have continued to use our proprietary tools to develop more courses on our cms without our assistance 
this trend has been exacerbated somewhat by another strategic initiative of ours  which is to offer free course conversion to large distance programs that want to move from competitor platforms to ours 
while this has negatively impacted our course development revenue  we believe it has positively impacted the higher margin student fee revenue due to the resulting availability of more online courses on the ecollege system 
other revenue includes elearning technical and instructional design consulting revenue of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
it also includes million of other revenue from our enrollment division  including  from interactive marketing services and  from media placement activities 
we expect to see continued growth in revenue for the elearning division in  but we expect that a greater percentage of that growth will be driven by the growth in student fee revenue as revenue from other product and service lines remain relatively stable 
with the inclusion of our enrollment division s revenue for the entire year  we expect revenue in to range from million to million  an increase of approximately from our total revenue  which includes only two months of datamark s results 
of this amount  approximately of revenue is expected to come from the enrollment division  and approximately of revenue to come from the elearning division 
revenue is expected to increase each quarter throughout the year 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million compared to million for the year ended december  the newly acquired enrollment division increased direct mail and other cost of revenue in by million 
student fees  campus and course fees  and other cost of revenue decreased by  or to million for the year ended december  this decrease is mainly attributable to a savings of  of depreciation expense primarily related to our internal technology cost of sales departments  commission expense of  and decreased nist costs of  offsetting these savings were increa sed salaries and related benefits of  and increased system costs of  amortization expense related to our capitalized software costs for both of the years ended december  and was million 
we expect our elearning division s cost of revenue  as a dollar amount  to remain relatively stable in due to operating efficiencies and current excess capacity in our data centers 
our average number of elearning division personnel in the operations and account management areas decreased to for the year ended december  from in the same period in  as we were able to improve on our operating efficiencies of our course development  help desk  and consulting services 
we had employees in our enrollment division s operations and account management areas at december  with the inclusion of our enrollment division s cost of revenue for the entire year  we expect to incur an increase of approximately from our total cost of revenue  which includes only two months of datamark s results 
gross profit 
we realized gross profit of million  resulting in a or million increase for the year ended december  compared to the million we realized in the new enrollment division contributed million to our gross profit for  while the elearning division contributed million for the year ended december  the favorable increase of million related to the elearning division was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a relatively higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources due to the realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses 
since we expect our elearning revenue to increase in while our cost of revenue for the elearning division is expected to remain consistent with levels  we expect continued improvement in our gross margin in for our elearning division 
however  datamark s gross margins have historically been lower than our elearning s division 
therefore  in we expect to have a gross margin of approximately to on a consolidated basis 
product development 
product development expenses decreased slightly to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division did not incur expenses related to product development during the period of our ownership in the elearning division recognized savings in rent  consulting  maintenance  and depreciation expenses of approximately  savings related to severance payments made to an executive during offset increases to salaries and benefits related to additional staff personnel  netting to a savings of  offsetting these savings were increases in travel and office expenses of  our development staff increased to for the year ended december  from in the same period in all development personnel in were in the elearning division 
we expect our development costs to increase in from the level incurred in as we continue to develop new products to respond to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
despite the lower cost of development activities in sri lanka associated with our new offshore development initiative as compared to our united states development activities  the additional expenses for product development activities is expected to be approximately million during the addition of datamark is not expected to have a material effect on our total product development expenses in selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or to million for the year ended december  the enrollment division had  of selling and marketing expenses recorded during the two months ended december   therefore accounting for the entire increase on a consolidated basis 
for the elearning division  selling and marketing expenses decreased to million in the decrease was partially due to reduced expenses related to conferences  advertising  and promotion costs of  which were somewhat offset by increased collateral costs of  as we focused on more activities directed at key decision makers within ou r target markets 
our elearning division marketing personnel costs remained consistent as we were staffed with an average of marketing related employees during both of the years ended december  and we had decreases in rent and depreciation expense associated with our sales and marketing groups of  from the same period last year 
our elearning division sales staff decreased to an average of employees in from in at december   the enrollment division had employees related to sales and marketing activities 
with the addition of the enrollment division  we expect a significant increase in total selling and marketing expenses in as we continue to serve both division s existing customers as well as attempt to grow our customer base 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million  of which  related to the newly acquired enrollment division 
additional factors for the increase during were increases in general corporate expenses such as franchise and personal property taxes  tax consulting  audit  and legal expenses of  as well as higher costs related to executive compensation and benefits including stock based compensation 
we also incurred approximately  of expenses specifically associated with the datamark acquisition 
these increased costs were offset somewhat by decreases in travel and depreciat ion expenses of  our facilities costs decreased in since we incurred  of one time expenses related to our corporate headquarters move during the year ended december  our executive and administrative personnel decreased to an average of in from during for the elearning division  while at december   the enrollment division had employees 
we record stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options and restricted share rights to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with our stock based compensation accounting policy 
the deferred charge is being amortized over the relevant vesting periods of such options or restricted share rights  which range from to years 
we recorded  of stock based compensation in the year ended december   of which approximately  was directly related to our adoption of sfas no  using the prospective method 
since we had previously accounted for our employee stock based awards in accordance with apb no 
 only  of stock based compensation was recorded in the year ended december  a portion of such compensation expense was all ocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense  and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards  however the majority of the stock based compensation expense relates to our executive team and was therefore included in general and administrative expense 
we anticipate that our total general and administrative expenses will increase in primarily for the following items million to million due to the addition of the enrollment division s executive and administrative staff and costs  million of stock based compensation related to restricted share rights granted to the datamark management team at the time of the acquisition   for the establishment of a corporate office in chicago  including hiring a new chief financial officer and additional office expenses such as rent  and  for other general corporate expenses and initiatives  such as sarbanes oxley compliance 
amortization of intangible assets 
our amortization of intangible assets of  consists entirely of the amortization of our identified intangible assets which we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships with an estimated value of million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of years  and non compete agreements valued at million are being amortized over their estimated useful life of years 
amortization expense related to those assets are expected to be approximately million in other income expense 
our interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by  to  for the year ended december  interest expense increased by million  the majority of which related to the debt obligations incurred to fund the acquisition of datamark  on october  included in interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately  of foregone debt issuance costs that were incurred in september  these costs were originally incurred to establ ish a financing commitment from a lender to fund the datamark acquisition 
however  prior to the consummation of the datamark acquisition  we were able to negotiate debt on more favorable terms with different lenders  therefore all of these costs were expensed during one of our sources of financing to complete the datamark acquisition was the debt we issued in october  with million in face value 
the majority of our debt is not due until  however due to the accounting treatment given to certain components of the debt we issued  our results of operations will include a significant amount of interest expense in and in the future 
for the year ended december   we incurred total interest expense of million 
since the majority of our current year interest expense was incurred in the final two months of  we expect that these expenses will be significantly higher in when we will incur twelve months of these expenses 
we expect total interest expense of million to million in net income 
our net income increased to  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december  from a net loss of million or per basic and diluted share in we expect to have net income in the range of million to million  or to per diluted share for the year ended december  years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
student fees represented million and of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
student enrollments in ecourses increased to  from  in the prior year  with the corresponding increase in revenue increasing to million from million in  due to our customers benefiting from volume pricing discounts 
student enrollments i n our lower priced ecompanion course supplements increased to  from  in the prior year  however total revenue recognized from such supplements increased during due primarily to a pricing program offered to customers with commitments to significant online distance education programs 
campus and course fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
we recognized revenue from developing  licensing  and hosting online campuses for different customers during  up from the customers that had online campuses in there were  new ecourses developed on our platform in  of which were individual courses developed by our professionals 
this compares to  and  respectively in other revenue includes technical and instructional design consulting revenue of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue from a grant from the national institute of standards and technology nist decreased to  from  for these same periods  respectively  due to the expiration of our research grant in april cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
our cost of revenue decreased primarily due to a reduction in the total costs under our grant program and the related decrease in our grant program liabilities  reduced personnel costs for our operations and account management groups and reduced outside consulting expenses 
the grant program resulted in a net reduction of cost of revenue expenses of  for the year ended december  compared to a net increase in cost of revenue expenses of million for grant program activities for t he year ended december  our average number of personnel in the operations and account management areas decreased to for the year ended december  from in the same period in  as we were able to improve on our operating efficiencies of our course development  help desk and consulting services while also concluding our nist research program 
personnel costs were  less in than in while external consulting decreased by  commission expense increased  however  by  from to amortization expense related to our capitalized software costs for years ended december  and was million and  respectively 
gross profit 
we realized a gross profit of million for the year ended december  as compared to a gross profit of million for year ended december  the favorable increase of million was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources  improved utilization of our professional services and consulting staff as we continue to improve the technology and business processes used to develop campuses and courses for our customers  and realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses as our revenue increased 
also contributing to the incr eased gross profit was the reduction of estimated total costs related to our grant program and the expiration of our nist research program 
product development 
product development expenses of million for the year ended december  were higher than the million expenses incurred for the year ended december  as we continue to design and develop enhanced features for our course management system and other product and hosting offerings  our personnel costs in the development group have increased by  however  the increase in personnel costs was partially offset by a  decrease in external consulting expense incurred during the year ended december   as compared with the same period in our development staff remained consistent with an average of employees for an d selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was partially due to decreases in direct mail and trade conference expenses of  which were somewhat offset by increased promotion costs of  as we focused on more activities directed at key decision makers within our target markets 
marketing expenses associated with the grant program for the year ended december  were  less than those in the same period last year 
our marketing personnel costs decreased  as we were staffed with an av erage of marketing related employees during the year ended december   down from an average of such employees in we also had a decrease in outside consulting services of  in the year ended  while depreciation expense associated with our sales and marketing groups decreased  from the same period last year 
our sales staff decreased to an average of employees in from in as we eliminated our internal telemarketing sales department in january general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in executive compensation  severance and amortization of deferred compensation  as well as other cost savings due to improved efficiencies 
total administrative salaries and other benefits decreased  and amortization of deferred compensation for our executives and board of directors decreased by approximately  these savings outweighed moderate increases in corporate insurance and building occupancy costs during we also incurred  of expenses related to our corporate headquarters move during the year ended december  our executive and administrative personnel decreased to an average of in from during we recorded deferred compensation in connection with the grant of stock options and restricted common stock to employees  officers  directors  and former executives in accordance with our stock based compensation accounting policy that was in effect during and the deferred charge was being amortized over the relevant vesting period of such options or restricted stock  which ranges from one to five years 
of the total deferred compensation we had recorded as of december    was amortized in the year ended december   while  was amortized in the year ended december  other income expense 
interest and other income  which consists primarily of interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash invested in interest bearing securities as a result of the use of such cash in our operations 
interest expense  primarily related to our capital lease lines of credit  was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense of  during the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the net realized losses on sales of our short term investments 
net loss 
our net loss decreased to million  or per share  from million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
segment information the two reportable segments disclosed in this document are based on our management organizational structure as of december  a detailed description of the products and services  as well as financial data  for each segment can be found in note of the consolidated financial statements in item please note that based on how our management team reviews and evaluates segment performance  amortization of intangible assets  along with interest and other income expense are not included in the following segment historical operating results 
rather  those types of expenses are only considered when evaluating the results of the consolidated company 
future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed 
historical results the historical results and discussions below include the historical results of each of ecollege s segments in fiscal   and  including datamark s results of operations from october  the acquisition date 
elearning division historical results year ended december  in thousands  except percentage net revenue income loss from operations income loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue elearning revenue grew in and in from the prior year 
the increase in revenue for both years is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
from our inception through december   the majority of our revenue was generated by development and design services fees for building online campuses and courses  and  to a lesser extent  student fees 
however  student fees represented million  million  and million of total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively  which translates into in creases of in both and in student fees have become the majority of our total elearning revenue as the number of online courses offered by our customers and the number of students enrolled in those courses delivered on our course management platform continues to increase while the revenue generated by our online campus and course development services has declined 
as previously mentioned  our student fee revenue growth has been outpaced by the growth in enrollments on the ecollege system due to various pricing programs that we offer to benefit customers with large online distance programs 
we expect these trends in our revenue mix and growth to continue in our customers offer traditional  as well as quarterly  bi monthly and monthly course terms to their students  therefore we typically host more courses during the spring academic term than in the summer or fall terms  primarily because the spring term starts at the beginning of the month as opposed to the summer and fall terms that start mid month 
as a result  there are more starts included in the first month of spring 
as a result  consecutive academic term enrollment results are not directly comparable 
the following table presents the number of student enrollments our customers had start in online courses and our lower priced course supplements during the   and spring  summer  and fall academic terms 
distance course enrollments on campus course supplement enrollments total student enrollments academic term spring january may summer may august fall august december total student enrollments for a more detailed explanation of revenue components and the growth trends of the elearning division revenue  please see the the information under the historical results section of the results of operations and future outlook category of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained earlier in this item income loss from operations and income loss from operations increased by million between and the favorable increase was primarily due to the increase in our student fees  which have a relatively higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources through the realization of operating leverage on the generally fixed nature of our data center expenses  and improved utilization of our professional services and consulting staff as we continue to improve the technology and business processes used to develop campuses and courses for our customers 
in addition  as we continue to become more efficient in designing and developing the enhanced features for our course management system and other product offerings  our development expenses have not grown in direct propo rtion to sales 
enrollment division historical results year ended december  in thousands  except percentage net revenue income loss from operations income loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue as datamark was acquired on october   the preceding results only show activity for the last two months of during the ten months ended october  prior to our acquisition of datamark  datamark s revenue was million and income from operations was million 
therefore  on a pro forma basis for the entire year  datamark s revenue was million and income from operations was million 
for a more detailed explanation of revenue components and operating results of the enrollment division  please see the the information under the historical results section of the results of operations and future outlook category of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained earlier in this item liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by million from million at december   to million at december  balances at december  and reflect cash from draws on our line of credit of million and million  respectively 
such draws were made to demonstrate the availability of the funds and were repaid in january of and  respectively 
the increase in total cash and cash equivalents from december  was primarily due to cash provided by financing activities of million and cash provided by operating activities of million  offset by net cash used in investing activities of million 
included in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million received in a pr ivate placement of million shares of common stock  reduced by million total issuance costs associated with the private placement 
included in the cash provided by operations for the year ended december  were adjustments to net income of million for depreciation and million for amortization expense of capitalized software and intangible assets 
through december  we also used million of cash to purchase datamark  including third party costs related to the acquisition  and have used million to purchase computer software and equipment 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement for the datamark acquisition  the purchase price was to be adjusted based upon datamark s working capital at the date of completion of the transaction 
ecollege and the former datamark stockholders agreed that million of the cash consideration paid by ecollege would be put into a working capital escrow until the final purchase price was determined 
as a result  the company currently has recorded million as due from former datamark stockholders on the consolidated balance sheet  of which million of cash is in escrow and  is owed from the former datamark stockholders 
however  the purchase price adjustment is being disputed by the selling stockholders  who have not yet agreed to this amount 
the stock purchase agreemen t provides for certain indemnification of ecollege by the selling stockholders  severally and not jointly 
to satisfy  in part  these indemnification obligations  million of the purchase price was placed in escrow and ecollege has the right to offset up to an additional million owed under the seller notes for indemnified claims 
however  the former stockholders of datamark are only liable to ecollege for indemnification under the terms of the sale of datamark if and only to the extent that the aggregate indemnifiable damages incurred by ecollege exceed the sum of  this limitation on indemnification does not apply to certain breaches of the representations of the selling stockholders under the stock purchase agreement  including indemnification for damages incurred by ecollege associated with any unpaid or unrecorded liabilities for taxes related to periods prior to october  ecollege has up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize its purchase accounting related to the acquisition 
if the company s expectations regarding amounts due from the former datamark stockholders change  an adjustment to goodwill may be recorded in the future 
as previously discussed  the company entered into an agreement in january with a third party to provide offshore development in sri lanka 
under the agreement  we are required to pay for services through january  anytime after this date  we can cancel the contract provided that we give six months notice  at which time we would continue to receive services pursuant to the agreement until the cancellation of the contract 
the company believes that we will incur expenses of approximately million related to this contract in issuance of equity securities we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities 
we have sold common stock and preferred stock generating aggregate proceeds of million  including our private placement offering in august  from inception through december  we used the net proceeds from these equity financings for funding capital expenditures and supporting sales  marketing  product development activities  expanding our data center  enhancing financial information systems  and for other expenses associated with our growth 
we also used the majority of the million net proceeds from our august private placement to partially fund the acquisition of datamark in october borrowings in october  the company entered into an agreement with a bank to obtain a million revolving line of credit  the revolver that will mature on october   and which replaced the previous revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the revolver is equal to the bank s prime rate  which was at december   plus  but at no time will be less than 
the revolver contains certain financial covenants and is secured by all of the company s assets 
in december  the company drew million from the revolver 
the entire amount was subsequently repaid in january we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  the company previously had a million revolving line of credit that was due to mature on april  the interest rate on the revolving line of credit was adjustable and was equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
in december  the company drew million from its revolving line of credit 
the entire million draw was subsequently repaid in january the company drew and repaid a total of million from its revolving line of credit at different points throughout the year ending december  the company obtained a million term loan term loan with a bank in october the term loan refinanced the existing term loan and the outstanding debt on the equipment lease facility described below 
the term loan has an interest rate of per annum 
the term loan will be repaid in equal installments and is secured by all of the company s assets 
at december   the company had million outstanding under the term loan 
the company also incurred approximately  in debt issuance costs in connection with the term loan 
these debt issuance costs were deferred and are being amortized as interest expense over the three year term of the loan 
the term loan contains certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  the previous term loan was obtained in may in order to refinance two sale leaseback arrangements  and had a month term and an adjustable interest rate of prime plus not to be less than nor more than 
the previous equipment lease facility was obtained in may  provided up to million in equipment financing  and had an adjustable rate of prime plus not to be less than nor more than 
as previously discussed  in october  the company issued million in senior subordinated notes to a lender 
the senior subordinated notes have principal payments due in million quarterly increments beginning on december   with interest payments due quarterly beginning on december   at a rate of per annum 
the senior subordinated notes are secured by all of the company s assets 
in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  the company issued warrants to the lender to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
however  if at the time of exercise of all or any portion of the warrants  the fair market value of the company s common stock is less than per share for the thirty trading days immedia tely preceding the date of such exercise  then the exercise price shall be automatically adjusted such that the exercise price will be equal to per share with respect to such exercise 
the warrants expire on october  the net proceeds received in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes totaled million  which were allocated to the senior subordinated notes and the warrants 
the company allocated million to the warrants based upon the fair value of the warrants  which was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  dividend yield  and an expected life of five years the contractual life 
the remaining million was allocated to the senior subordinated notes 
the debt discount attributable to the value of the warrants will be amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes using the interest method 
the company also incurred approximately million in debt issua nce costs in connection with the senior subordinated notes 
the debt issuance costs were deferred and will be amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes 
the senior subordinated notes contain certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants of of december  also in connection with the acquisition of datamark in october  the company issued seller notes totaling million as previously discussed 
the seller notes  with interest and principal due in  are comprised of a series of notes issued to the selling stockholders  aggregating to million  which bear simple interest at a rate of per annum and another series of notes issued to the selling stockholders  aggregating to million  which bear simple interest at a rate of  compounded annually 
the company recorded million for the notes issued to the sellers based upon their estimated fair value  resulting in a discount of million  which is being amortized over the term of the debt using the interest method 
the fair value of the seller notes was deter mined by an independent third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes  and other comparable debt securities 
due to the discounts on the senior subordinated notes and seller notes  any pre payments of these debt obligations would result in additional interest expense in the period of any such pre payment 
the senior subordinated notes also contain a provision that provides for the acceleration of all interest payments due through october  upon early extinguishment of the debt prior to october  as a result of the debt discounts recorded on the senior subordinated notes  and the sellers notes  and the associated debt issuance costs  the effective interest rate on these debt instruments is and  respectively 
we expect our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to use between million and million for purchases of property and equipment in we also expect to have principal and cash interest due on our debt in of approximately million 
based on our expected cash flows from operating activities  we therefore expect to increase our cash and cash equivalents by between million and million during  excluding any payments or draws on our revolver 
we may desire or need to raise additional capital through public or private financing  strategic relationships  or other arrangements in the future 
in the event that we desire or need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to us 
furthermore  we may have to sell stock at prices lower than those paid by existing stockholders  which would result in dilution to those stockholders  or we may have to sell stock or bonds with rights superior to rights of holders of common stock 
we have incurred significant additional debt as of december   which could make it more difficult or expensive to raise additional capital 
any debt financing might involve restrictive covenants that could limit our op erating flexibility 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial position 
any future need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt including current portion line of credit operating lease obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments of the stated face value of principal on our debt and do not include any interest or fair value adjustments 
our line of credit was repaid in january the company leases office space and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases 
rent expense for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
we expect rent expense to be approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated vie transactions 
recent accounting pronouncements effective july   the company adopted eitf eitf addresses how to allocate revenue in arrangements that include more than one product or service and governs how to identify whether goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately 
eitf is applied prospectively to arrangements entered into in periods beginning after june  the adoption of this rule had no impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
risk factors this section identifies certain risks that we face 
if we are unable to appropriately address these and other circumstances that could have a negative effect on our business our business may suffer 
negative events are likely to decrease our revenues  increase our costs  make our financial results worse  and decrease our financial strength  and may cause our stock price to decline 
in management s current assessments the most significant risks that could affect our business include the following we operate in a highly competitive market 
the online learning market is evolving quickly and is subject to rapid technological change 
the market is highly competitive  with no single competitor accounting for a dominant market share 
competition is most intense from software companies with specific products for the college and university market  service companies which seek to offer a complete solution utilizing their own services and third party software  systems integrators  and hardware vendors 
some colleges and universities construct online learning systems utilizing in house personnel and creating their own software or purchasing software components from a vendor 
other competitors in this market include a wide range of education and training providers using video  mail correspondence  cd rom  and live online training 
the market for enrollment marketing services to the post secondary education market is also highly competitive 
competition is most intense from colleges and universities that perform their own enrollment marketing services in house 
datamark also faces competition from other enrollment marketing companies in the market  as well as from direct marketing companies  media placement agencies  and online marketing companies 
we believe that the level of competition will continue as new technologies are developed  as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market 
the rapid growth of the online learning market and the for profit post secondary education market is likely to attract additional well financed competitors 
some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial  marketing  and other resources than we do 
certain competitors may be able to secure alliances with customers and affiliates on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to syste ms development than we can 
in addition  it is possible that certain competitors  or potential competitors  could reduce their pricing to levels that would make it difficult for us to compete 
increased competition may result in reduced operating margins  as well as loss of market share and brand recognition 
in addition  in order to compete effectively in our markets  we may need to change our business in significant ways 
for example  we may change our pricing  product  or service offerings  make key decisions about technology directions or marketing strategies  or acquire additional businesses or technologies 
any of these actions or effects could hurt our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a relatively small number of customers 
revenue from a small number of customers has comprised a substantial portion of our historical elearning division revenue and is expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future 
our largest elearning customers accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  any cancellation  deferral  or significant reduction in work performed for these principal customers  or failure to collect accounts receivable from these principal customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
one of the elearning division s largest customers has notified us that it will not renew its guaranteed minimum contract with us when it expires in april this customer generated app roximately of our total consolidated revenue during the year ended december  revenue from a small number of customers has comprised a substantial portion of the enrollment division s revenue and is expected to represent a substantial portion of its revenue in the foreseeable future 
datamark s largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  any cancellation  deferral  or significant reduction in work performed for these principal customers  or failure to collect accounts receivable from these principal customers  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  and results of operations of datamark and the combined companies 
our network infrastructure and computer systems may fail 
the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our network infrastructure and computer systems is critical to our success 
any system failure that causes interruptions in our ability to provide services could reduce customer satisfaction and  if sustained or repeated  would reduce the attractiveness of our technology and services to our customers and their students 
an increase in the number of students online through our servers could strain the capacity of our software or hardware  which could lead to slower response times or system failures 
we continually test our user capacity by simulating load capacity based on projected student enrollments 
to the extent we do not successfully address capacity constraints  such constraints could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
because our services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential customer and student information our success depends on our ability to provide superior network security protection and the confidence of our customers in that ability 
our system is designed to prevent unauthorized access from the internet and  to date  our operations have not been affected by security breaks  nevertheless  in the future we may not be able to prevent unauthorized disruptions of our network operations  whether caused unintentionally or by computer hackers or by the failure of our internet service providers to provide us with adequate bandwidth and service 
despite precautions we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions or delays in the delivery of our products and services 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we are almost exclusively dependent on microsoft for our underlying software technology platform 
we are therefore potentially vulnerable to business or operational disruption caused by changes in the microsoft platform  security flaws in microsoft software  and or potential price increases or licensing changes by microsoft 
we have incurred debt  which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future and react to changes in our business 
we incurred significant additional debt in connection with the datamark acquisition  leaving us with approximately million of total principal debt obligations at december   excluding the line of credit of million  which was repaid in january  compared to total debt of million at september  the million term loan and the million senior subordinated notes are secured by all of our assets 
our debt could have important consequences to our stockholders 
because of our substantial debt our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes  or other purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes  we may be exposed to increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited  and we may be more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions or our business or be unable to carry out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and productivity improvement programs 
the breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in our term loan  senior subordinated notes  seller notes  or our revolver could result in a default under the applicable agreement which would permit the applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and foreclose on our assets 
in any such case  we may be unable to make any borrowings under our revolver and may not be able to repay the amounts due under our term loan  senior subordinated notes  or seller notes 
this could have serious consequences to financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent 
our stock price is likely to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to factors such as the following  some of which are beyond our control quarterly variations in our operating results  operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in market valuations of other online service companies or our customers  future sales of our common stock  stock market price and volume fluctuations  general political and economic conditions  such as a recession  war or terrorist attacks or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations  and other risk factors discussed in or incorporated by reference into this report 
these factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the market prices for stocks of many internet related and technology companies have historically experienced extreme price fluctuations that appeared to bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
in the event our stock price fell significantly  investors might sue the company  causing increased litigation expenses and  possibly  the payment of large damages or settlement fees 
we may not effectively manage the integration of datamark or any future acquisitions that we may make into ecollege 
our acquisition of datamark was consummated on october   however  the ultimate successful integration of datamark into ecollege and realization of the expected benefits of the acquisition will require  among other things  the following retention and relationship management of existing customers of both companies  retention of strategic partners of each company  minimization of disruption of each company s ongoing business and distraction of its management  integration of the two companies information and software systems and other operations  developing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures  and policies  including internal controls  and limiting expenses related to integration 
we may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems or liabilities encountered in connection with the acquisition 
the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the process of combining the companies could cause the disruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of our business or could cause the impairment of relationships with customers and business partners 
further  the process of combining the two companies businesses could negatively affect employee morale and our ability to retain some key employees  and could cause customers to cancel existing agreements  not renew contracts upon their expiration  or choose not to purchase new products or services from us 
in the event that the traditional customers and business partners of either company are not receptive to the products and services of the other  we may not realize some of the expected benefits of the acquisition 
if the benefits of the acquisition do not exceed the associated costs  including costs associated with integrating the two companies  our financial results  including earnings per share and stock price  could be materially adversely affected 
we may make additional acquisitions  or invest in other companies 
acquisitions  including that of datamark  involve a number of risks  including but not limited to those set forth above and the following the creation of a variety of accounting charges  which could increase our reported expenses  including impairment of goodwill and the write off of acquired intangible assets  diminishing the value of our brands or reputation if an acquired company turns out to be a poor performer  and the assumption of most or all of the liabilities of the acquired companies  some of which may be hidden  significant  or not reflected in the final acquisition price 
certain aspects of the datamark acquisition could negatively impact our financial results 
certain aspects of the datamark acquisition could negatively impact our financial results 
we recorded a significant portion of the approximate million purchase price as goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions require significant judgment in terms of establishing their fair value  determining appropriate amortization periods  and assessing such intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment in the future 
it is possible that our review of such intangible assets in the future could determine that they are impaired and the amount of such impairment could be significant 
we recorded approximately million of the purchase price as identifiable intangible assets  which will cause us to record additional non cash amortization expense i n the future and which will also be reviewed periodically for impairment in the future 
an impairment charge could be material  if it is determined that an impairment of the assets has occurred 
we are also incurring interest expense related to fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the senior subordinated notes and the discount to fair value of the sellers notes 
we will also have increased cash interest expense due to the increased debt levels we ve incurred to finance the acquisition  and will be required to repay the face amount of these debt instruments million upon their maturity 
all of these additional expenses and cash outflows could negatively impact our financial results  financial position  and liquidity 
we may desire or need to raise additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms 
we may desire or need to raise additional capital through public or private financing  strategic relationships  or other arrangements in the future 
in the event that we desire or need to raise additional capital  we cannot assure that additional funds will be available or that funds will be available on terms favorable to us 
furthermore  we may have to sell stock at prices lower than those paid by existing stockholders  which would result in dilution to those stockholders  or we may have to sell stock or bonds with rights superior to rights of holders of common stock 
any debt financing might involve restrictive covenants that could limit our operating flexibility 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services a nd products  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial position 
any future need to raise additional funds could also directly and adversely affect our stockholders investment in our common stock 
we depend on our customers and third parties to market student enrollments for online courses 
a substantial portion of our elearning division revenue is derived from fees for each enrollment in an online course that we host for our customers 
generally  we do not market directly to students to generate enrollments in our customers courses and therefore have little influence on the number of students that enroll 
we are therefore dependent on the institutions and organizations that purchase our products and services to market to individual students 
the failure of these third parties to effectively attract  maintain  and increase student enrollments could affect our revenue growth and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
although datamark provides enrollment marketing services for its customers  the majority of datamark s customers are not customers of our elearning division  and there can be no assurance that they will become customers of our elearning division 
we may be unable to sustain profitability 
although we reported net income for the first time during the second quarter of  and datamark  under its previous owners and structure  has realized net income for each reporting period since  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to sustain profitability 
we believe that our success depends  among other things  on our ability to increase our revenue by further developing existing customer relationships and developing new relationships with colleges  universities  and other potential customers without increasing our expenses at the same rate 
if we are unable to continue to increase our revenue  our business and financial results will be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement by third parties 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and technology  such as our trade and product names  and the proprietary software included in our products 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  servicemarks  patents  trade secret laws  and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect these rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to duplicate or copy aspects of our services or software or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
if others infringe or misappropriate our copyrights  servicemarks or other proprietary rights  our business could be hurt 
in addition  the laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an e xtent as do the laws of the united states 
our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  although we do not believe that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others  other parties might assert infringement claims against us 
we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property 
these disputes  even if without merit  could lead to litigation  which may be time consuming and costly even if we are successful  may require us to redesign our products or services  may require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  and could be a distraction to management  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our agreements with our customers require us to indemnify our customers in the event they are sued by a third party claiming that the ecollege system infringes a third party s intellectual property rights 
in the event of such a lawsuit against our customers  these indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government regulation may adversely affect our future operating results 
the federal government  through the higher education act and other legislation  may consider changes in the law that affect distance education in higher education 
legislation could be adopted that would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet  relating to user privacy  content  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or expansion of online education  and may cause us to incur unanticipated compliance costs 
our increasing presence in many states across the country may subject us to additional tax laws and government regulations  which may adversely a ffect our future operating results 
our violation of any state statutes  laws or other regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
the sales cycle for our products and services varies widely and it may be difficult for us to predict the timing of particular sales  the rate at which online campuses  courses  and or course supplements will be implemented  the number of students who will enroll in the online courses  or the rate of which new or future customers will utilize our enrollment growth services 
because a significant portion of our elearning division s costs are fixed and are based on anticipated revenue levels  small variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
since we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant decrease in revenue w ould likely have an immediate material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
additionally  our operating expenses may fluctuate due to changes in accounting standards and or our elected accounting policies 
further  any such variations could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in such an event  the trading price of our stock would likely fall and investors might sue the company  causing increased litigation expenses and  possibly  the payment of large damages or settlement fees 
datamark does not have long term agreements with its customers and may be unable to retain customers  attract new customers or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenues 
most of datamark s contracts with its customers are short term 
datamark s current customers may not continue to use its products and services  datamark may not be able to replace in a timely or effective manner departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenues  and datamark may not continue to increase its customer base 
further  there can be no assurance that datamark s customers will continue to generate consistent amounts of revenues over time 
datamark s failure to develop and sustain long term relationships with its customers could materially and adversely affect the results of operations of datamark and ecollege as a whole 
if we are unable to continue to receive our current level of access to and costs for mailing lists  our competitive advantage could be materially affected 
our enrollment division obtains mailing lists from third party vendors 
because of our unique relationships with some of our key vendors  we are able to purchase these lists in high volumes under favorable pricing and in an efficient format 
if we were unable to continue to obtain these mailing lists at our current pricing levels  and in the format in which we historically have received these lists  it could reduce our competitive advantage and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on our key personnel 
our success depends on the performance of senior management and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain senior management and highly qualified key personnel 
the loss of the services of a number of senior management personnel or highly qualified key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are subject to risk from general economic conditions 
our revenue is subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of products and services to colleges and universities 
should current weak economic conditions continue or worsen  these organizations may not increase or may reduce their expenditures  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
increases in postal rates and paper costs could harm datamark s business 
the direct marketing activities of datamark may be adversely affected by postal rate increases  especially increases that are imposed without sufficient advance notice to allow adjustments to be made to marketing budgets 
increased postal rates may lead to pressure from datamark s customers to reduce its prices for its services in order to offset any postal rate increase 
higher paper costs prices may also cause datamark s customers to conduct fewer or smaller mailings  which could cause a corresponding decline in the demand for datamark s services 
any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect the business  financial condition and results of operations of datamark and ecollege as a whole 
our business and future operating results are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks on the united states of america 
our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of terrorist attacks on the united states of america 
these uncertainties include the potential worsening or extension of the global economic slowdown and the economic consequences of military action or additional terrorist activities 
while terrorist attacks have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  any future attacks or events arising as a result of the attacks  such as interruptions to the international telecommunications network or the internet  could have a material impact on our business 
selected quarterly information unaudited in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that our revenue and other operating results should not be relied upon as indications of future performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company is  or may become  exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
additionally  the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash  which was million at december   including million of borrowed funds that were repaid in early january historically we have invested available cash in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  and investment grade commercial paper that generally had maturities of three months or less  as well as debt securities of united states government agencies and corporate bonds 
our short term investment portfolio is managed in accordance with our investment policy 
the company s investment policy requires that its investment portfolio be limited to investment securities of less than one year in maturity 
furthermore  as a result of a change in the company s investment strategy during the third quarter of to limit risk exposure  all of our invested cash has been in money market accounts since october as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low 
however  factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability to meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
during  we were also exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt 
in may  the company refinanced two sale leaseback arrangements into one term loan with a bank 
the term loan had an adjustable interest rate of prime plus  but would not be less than nor more than 
at that time  the company also entered into a million equipment lease facility with a bank that was treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes 
the interest rate on the capital lease was an adjustable rate of prime plus  but would not be less than nor more than 
the company obtained a new million term loan term loan with the bank in october the term loan refinanced and terminated the existing term loan and the outstanding debt on the equipment lease faci lity 
the term loan has an interest rate of per annum 
we have not undertaken any other interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or our cash equivalents nor would it materially impact the earnings or cash flow associated with our cash investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
although our revolving line of credit bears interest at an adjustable rate of prime plus  a hypothetical ten percent change in the market rates as of december  would not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows in  as the entire million of borrowings outstanding at december   were repaid in january we anticipate drawing on our line of credit only for short term working capital needs during
