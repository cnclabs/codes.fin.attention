the amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and had no alternative future uses 
as of the acquisition date  there were four projects that met the above criteria 
the significant ipr d projects identified consist of the e lab notebook and the automatic lc ms dereplication system 
the ipr d charges associated with these projects were million and million  respectively 
management determined the valuation of the ipr d using a number of factors  including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal 
the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method 
this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of the projects  ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects  iii whether the projects had an alternative future use  and iv the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product has met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
as of the acquisition date  none of the ipr d projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
in assessing the technological feasibility of a project  consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome 
as of the acquisition date  the company estimated the e lab notebook to be complete and the automatic lc ms dereplication system to be complete 
future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved 
these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion 
the discount rates include a rate of return  which accounts for the time value of money  as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized 
the cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from to per annum  depending on the project s stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed 
this discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased ipr d resulted in a total valuation of million 
although work on the projects related to the ipr d continued after the acquisition  the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was written 
table of contents off because the projects underlying the ipr d that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date 
as of december   the ipr d projects still had not reached technological feasibility 
the expected remaining costs to complete these projects are not considered material to the company and there are currently no expected material variations between projected results from the projects versus those at the time of the acquisition 
the company expects the projects to be completed within the next twelve months

factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company s capitalized patent  trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  the company ceased amortization of approximately million of goodwill as of december  the company had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during in lieu of amortization  the company is required to perform annual impairment reviews of its goodwill 
the company performed its annual review during and currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that at the time future reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization  and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company has realized significant income tax benefits associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options 
the corresponding credit was to additional paid in capital 
because of the outstanding stock options  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  a valuation allowance has reduced to zero all the deferred tax assets relating to us income 
litigation as described in item of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make both of these determinations  and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described under the headings applera corporation and hewlett packard company 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges  which could materially impact the company s results of operation or financial position
