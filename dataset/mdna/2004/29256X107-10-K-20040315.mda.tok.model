encysive pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of novel  synthetic  small molecule compounds to address unmet medical needs 
our research and development programs are predominantly focused on the treatment and prevention of interrelated diseases of the vascular endothelium and exploit our expertise in the area of the intravascular inflammatory process  referred to as the inflammatory cascade  and vascular diseases 
we have successfully developed one fda approved drug  argatroban  for the treatment of hit  that is marketed by gsk 
our lead drug candidate  thelin tm  is an endothelin receptor antagonist in phase iii clinical trials for the treatment of pah 
in addition  we have earlier stage clinical product candidates in development including tbc  a next generation endothelin receptor antagonist  and bimosiamose  being developed by our majority owned german affiliate  revotar 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from service contracts as services are performed 
royalty revenue is recognized as products are sold by a licensee and we have received sufficient information to record a receivable 
our royalty revenue is based on net sales of product  that is  sales net of discounts  returns and allowances 
we have estimated a percentage of gross sales  based on recent experience  as an allowance for future returns  however there can be no assurance that our estimate will be accurate 
we believe  however  that differences between estimated and actual future returns will not have a material effect upon our results of operations or financial condition 
revenue from collaborative research and development activities is recognized as services are performed 
we defer the recognition of milestone payments related to contractual agreements which are still in the development stage 
such deferred revenues are amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
milestone payments received under contractual agreements which have completed the development stage are evaluated  and either recognized into income when earned  or amortized over a future period  depending upon whether we continue to have obligations under the terms of the arrangement 
license fees received under the terms of licensing agreements for our intellectual property are deferred  and amortized into income over the estimated development period of the licensed item or items 
revenue from grants is recognized as earned under the terms of the related grant agreements  typically as expenses are incurred 
amounts received in advance of services being performed under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized as services are performed 
we periodically evaluate our estimates of remaining development periods  and adjust the recognition of remaining deferred revenues over the adjusted development period remaining 
at december   remaining deferred revenue was approximately million  of which we expect to recognize approximately million over the next months 
a future change in our estimate of development periods could accelerate or decelerate the timing of future recognition of deferred revenue 
stock options we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb in accounting for our stock option plans and apply fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations fas in reporting for our stock option plans 
apb utilizes the intrinsic value of stock options  defined as the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying share of common stock  on the measurement date which is generally the date of grant 
since the exercise price of employee stock options issued under our plans is set to match the market price of our common stock  there is generally no compensation expense recognized upon grant of employee stock options 
options granted to non employees  if any  are valued at the fair value of the option as defined by fas  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
we record compensation expense for the fair value of options granted to non employees 
the pro forma effect of recognizing the fair value of stock option grants to employees on our consolidated results of operations is discussed in note m  stock based compensation 
results of operations the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly during each quarter and year  and we anticipate that such fluctuations  which are largely attributable to varying research and development commitments and expenditures  will continue for the next several years 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we invest in product research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we have sustained net losses of approximately million from the date of our inception to december  we have primarily financed our operations to date through a series of private placements and public offerings of our common stock and several collaborative agreements with third parties to jointly pursue product research and development 
see discussion of liquidity and capital resources below

in april  we acquired the interest of icos in elp in a transaction also referred to as the acquisition 
for more information about the acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
of the million purchase price  million was paid at closing  and the remaining million is subject to the terms of a note to icos requiring a million payment in april and a million payment in october deferred revenue of million  arising from previous payments received by us from elp for a license fee and milestones  was recognized as an offset to the purchase price  resulting in a charge for the purchase of in process research and development of million in from its inception in june through december   we and icos shared equally in the costs of elp 
icos informed us  however  that it had reached the conclusion that joint development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program through elp should not continue 
as a result  from january until the acquisition  we agreed to be responsible for of the costs of elp under the terms of a letter agreement  which expired upon the acquisition 
from its inception in june through march   we accounted for our investment in elp under the equity method 
as a result of the acquisition  we now include the accounts of elp in our consolidated financial statements 
a result of the consolidation of elp into our financial statements is that the revenue item  collaborative research and development from encysive  lp and the expense item  equity in loss of encysive  lp are eliminated and the operating expenses of elp are included in our operating expenses 
following the acquisition  we changed the name of icos tbc to encysive  lp year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in year increased to million from million compared with year royalties earned on sales of argatroban by gsk increased million  or approximately in compared with  due to higher net sales of argatroban in the current year 
in  gsk created a hospital based sales force and initiated programs to increase the sales effort on argatroban in the us and canada  which we believe contributed to the increase in argatroban sales and in our royalty revenues 
the increase in royalties was partially offset by the elimination of collaborative research and development from related party revenues  due to the acquisition 
collaborative research and development from related party was million in year  compared with million in year  a decrease of million 
research agreement income decreased million in year  compared with year research agreement revenues are primarily comprised of payments received from schering plough for research on vla antagonists 
following the naming of a clinical candidate  and receipt of a milestone payment from schering plough in june  we are continuing research on backup vla antagonists  however fewer resources are devoted to the program than in earlier periods 
if the research agreement is not extended  it will expire in june  and our research agreement revenues will end 
research and development expense the endothelin receptor antagonist program has been conducted within elp from its inception in june prior to december   we included our share of elp s losses in our financial results under the caption equity in loss of elp 
as discussed above  in april  we acquired icos s interest in elp and as a result  from january until the acquisition  we agreed to be responsible for of the costs of elp under the terms of a letter agreement  which expired upon the acquisition 
total research and development expenses in year increased million  or approximately  compared with year the net increase is primarily comprised of the following items costs of thelin tm development included in research and development expenses in year totaled million 
our share of thelin tm development costs in year were included in our equity in loss of encysive  lp clinical trials costs other than for thelin tm development declined million in year  compared to year clinical trials costs were primarily related to our study of argatroban as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke 
other research costs in year declined million compared to  primarily due to our restructuring of our research programs in january purchase of in process research and development on the date of the acquisition the partnership had no assets other than its rights to the in process research and development of the endothelin receptor antagonist program 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we agreed to pay to icos a purchase price of million  of which million was paid on closing 
the remaining million is subject to a secured promissory note 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the only asset acquired was in process research and development  we recorded a charge for in process research and development of million less unamortized deferred revenues of million 
the unamortized deferred revenues of million relate to the previous payments received from elp that were being amortized into income over the estimated remaining development period 
due to the short term nature of the note and the associated interest rate  the note was not discounted when calculating the in process research and development charge 
equity in loss of encysive  lp our equity in loss of elp in year of million was comprised of our share of the partnership s expenses  all of which were related to the thelin tm development program 
as discussed above  year equity in loss of encysive  lp of million is comprised of of the thelin tm development program costs through the date of the acquisition 
thelin tm development costs incurred subsequent to the acquisition are consolidated in our financial statements 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million in year  compared with year year expenses  however  include expenses related to the thelin tm development program  primarily consisting of patent legal costs  totaling million 
general and administrative expenses other than those related to the thelin tm development program decreased approximately million in compared to operating loss operating loss increased million in year  compared with year the increase is primarily comprised of the million charge resulting from the acquisition  discussed above  and increased costs of the thelin tm development program in year investment income investment income declined million in year compared with year the decrease is primarily due to lower levels of funds available for investment throughout year  and to lower prevailing market interest rates in year minority interest in loss of revotar the minority interest in loss of revotar  comprised of of the net loss of revotar  was unchanged between the two year periods 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  it is likely that the cumulative losses of revotar will exceed the equity interest of its minority shareholders during  and we will reflect of its losses in our consolidated net income or loss thereafter 
net loss net loss increased million in year  primarily due to the million charge resulting from the acquisition  and increased costs of the thelin tm development program in year year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues revenues in the year ended december  increased million  compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased royalty income earned on sales of argatroban by gsk and increased license fees  milestones and grants  partially offset by reduced research and development revenues  discussed below 
royalties earned on sales of argatroban in were million  an increase of million over year we earn royalties based upon sales by gsk to drug wholesalers 
in october  gsk initiated a broad based hit disease education media campaign designed to increase awareness of hit  the life threatening reaction to heparin for which argatroban is approved 
as medical education is key to growing argatroban sales  we believe this initiative  along with increased selling efforts  are likely to have a positive impact on argatroban sales 
license fees  milestones and grants increased million in  compared with revotar was awarded research grants from the german government and earned approximately million in year in addition to the grants received by revotar  the increase in license fees  milestones and grants in was primarily comprised of revenues related to the milestone payment received from mitsubishi in may  the milestone payment received from icos in july  and the milestone payment received from schering plough in june see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research agreement revenues  resulting from our collaborative efforts with unrelated parties  declined million in  compared with  primarily resulting from reduced research and development effort under the schering plough agreement during most of our efforts toward development of an initial candidate for clinical development had been completed late in as discussed above  we received a milestone payment under the schering plough agreement as a result of the nomination of an initial candidate for schering plough s further development in the second quarter of collaborative research and development revenues received from elp declined million in  compared with the involvement of our research and development staff in the endothelin receptor antagonist program has been dependent upon the activities being performed by the partnership in any particular period  and was expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expense research and development expenses increased million in  compared with the increase was primarily due to costs of clinical trials which began to incur significant expenses early in year and were ongoing during year trials ongoing during year included a phase ii study of argatroban in ischemic stroke and a phase ii study of argatroban in patients undergoing pci 
during  revotar completed a phase iia proof of concept clinical trial of bimosiamose in psoriasis  and completed a phase i clinical trial for asthma utilizing an inhaled form of bimosiamose 
see also the discussion of our ongoing research and development programs  in item  business herein 
equity in loss of encysive  lp our equity in the loss of elp  primarily consisting of research and development expenses  declined million in  compared with the principle activity of the partnership  a phase iib iii trial of thelin tm for pah  completed enrollment in july general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million in  compared with insurance costs  particularly product liability and general liability policies  increased both due to insurance market conditions  and as a result of increased sales of argatroban 
general and administrative expenses in included costs associated with the retirement  recruiting and hiring of key personnel  including a non cash charge in the first quarter of of approximately million in compensation expense arising from modifications made to stock options previously issued to our retiring ceo 
investment income investment income declined million in  compared with the decline is due to a combination of lower prevailing interest rates during  compared with  and to reduced funds available for investment during year minority interest in loss of revotar the interest of revotar s minority shareholders in its losses increased approximately million in  compared with revotar s expenses increased in  primarily due to the costs of clinical trials conducted in net loss our net loss in increased million in  compared with the increase is due primarily to higher operating expenses and lower investment income during  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources year and at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of million  compared with million at december  we used million in cash on operating activities in year  compared to cash used by operating activities of million in the primary operating uses of cash in and were to fund our general operating expenses and the ongoing research and development programs conducted by encysive  revotar and elp  reduced by cash received from investment income  milestones  and research payments from our collaborative partners 
investing activities are primarily comprised of our investments in debt securities 
cash is generated from investment activities when marketable securities mature  and the resulting cash is utilized  primarily to fund operating activities 
cash used in investing activities includes a million payment to icos in upon the acquisition  and purchases of equipment 
in  we initiated programs to reduce expenses and to conserve cash  and as a result capital expenditures declined million in year compared with year  in and  revotar received grants from the german government toward the purchase of eligible equipment of approximately million per year 
cash generated by financing activities in year was million  compared with cash generated in year of million 
financing activities in year primarily consisted of funds raised in a public offering in december of million  million borrowed by revotar from its minority shareholders and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
during  we generated million in cash from the proceeds of employee purchases of stock and employee stock option exercises 
contractual obligations our material contractual obligations are comprised of i a note payable to icos arising from the acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements  ii amounts borrowed by revotar from its minority shareholders see note  iii obligations under our operating lease agreements see note to the consolidated financial statements  and iv under one research agreement we could be obligated to pay the other party a termination fee in the event that we elect to terminate the project prior to completion see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had contractual obligations as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt    operating leases    purchase obligations total     outlook for in  we expect to have the following results royalties to million revenues including royalties to million expenses net of revotar minority interest to million investment income to million net loss to million cash and investments at year end to million these expectations are based upon various assumptions  which are subject to certain risks  trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
among these risks  trends and uncertainties are timing and cost of our clinical trials  attainment of research and clinical goals and milestones of product candidates  and sales levels of argatroban 
we have assumed that sales trends of argatroban over the previous year will continue 
while we do not sell argatroban  our revenues include a royalty from gsk  which is based on sales and will  accordingly  vary with sales 
our actual royalty revenues could vary from our assumptions to the extent that gsk s actual sales of argatroban differ from assumed levels 
projected revenues contain continued amortization of deferred license fees and milestones previously received from schering plough  which are being deferred over the estimated development period of the respective compound or program 
we periodically review our estimates of development periods  and actual recognized revenues could increase or decrease to the extent that we decrease or increase our estimated development periods 
we have not assumed research agreement revenues from schering plough beyond june  projected operating expenses are based upon our approved operating budget for the year 
in the budgeting process  we have not assumed significant changes in the number of employees during year  and have assumed continued development of thelin tm 
our budgeted expenses also include basic research efforts on our other programs  and levels of administrative support we believe to be necessary 
projected investment income assumes that the rate of return on invested funds of approximately on an average of approximately million in funds available for investment throughout the year 
cash and investments at year end is projected based upon our projected sources and uses of cash during the year 
in projecting our end of year cash and investment balances  we have not assumed additional financing or collaborative arrangements other than those in place at this time 
the range of estimated net loss is based upon our projected revenues and expenses  as discussed above 
longer term outlook we expect to incur substantial research and development expenditures as we design and develop biopharmaceutical products for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in subsequent years because we expect to incur significant expenses in conjunction with additional clinical trial costs for thelin tm and research and clinical trial costs for development of bimosiamose compounds and expect to begin to incur costs for clinical trials related to additional compounds 
these costs include hiring personnel to direct and carry out all operations related to clinical trials  hospital and procedural costs  services of a contract research organization  and purchasing and formulating large quantities of the compound to be used in such trials 
there may be additional costs in future periods related to argatroban in complying with ongoing fda requirements 
our administrative costs and costs to commercialize our products will increase as our products are further developed and marketed 
if thelin tm receives regulatory approval  we will incur significant commercialization expenses 
we have been unprofitable to date and expect to incur operating losses for the next several years as we invest in research and development  preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory compliance 
we will require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development of our product candidates  to establish commercial scale manufacturing facilities  if necessary  and to market our products 
estimates of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including market acceptance and commercial success of argatroban  expenses and risks associated with clinical trials to expand the indications for thelin tm  continued scientific progress in our drug discovery programs  the magnitude of these programs  progress with preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments and changes in our existing research relationships  our ability to maintain and establish additional collaborative arrangements  and effective commercialization activities and arrangements 
subject to these factors  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and other revenue sources  should be sufficient to fund our cash requirements into the third quarter of notwithstanding revenues  which may be produced through sales of potential future products  if approved  we anticipate that we will need to secure additional funds to continue the required levels of research and development to reach our long term goals 
we intend to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings 
upon regulatory approval  we intend to commercialize thelin tm in north america through our own specialty sales force 
we are seeking a marketing partner or partners for sales in the rest of the world 
in  the stockholders of revotar executed an agreement to provide approximately million in unsecured loans  of which our commitment was approximately million 
under the loan agreement  we have advanced approximately million to revotar as of december   and we expect to advance an additional million to revotar in we believe that revotar s existing funds  the remaining commitment under the loan agreement and proceeds under german government scientific grants will be sufficient to fund revotar into the first quarter of in order to continue to operate beyond that time  revotar will need to seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and or through public or private financings in the future 
revotar is actively seeking a partner or partners to develop the inhaled indications of bimosiamose 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the pharmaceutical research industry is labor intensive  and wages and related expenses increase in inflationary periods 
the lease of space and related building services for the houston facility contains a clause that escalates rent and related services each year based on the increase in building operating costs and the increase in the houston consumer price index  respectively 
to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following describes the nature of this risk that is not believed to be material to us 
we have a majority owned affiliate in berlin  germany and consolidate the results of operations into our consolidated financial results 
although not material to date  our reported expenses and cash flows from this affiliate are exposed to changing exchange rates 
we also have contracts with entities in other areas outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  these currencies have not fluctuated materially 
at december   revotar had entered into a foreign exchange forward contract with a bank to mitigate the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on approximately million in future loan payments from us
