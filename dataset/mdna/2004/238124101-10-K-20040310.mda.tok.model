item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide asset performance management software and services to enterprises worldwide  including more than percent of the fortune through asset performance management  customers can maintain  manage  and improve the performance of their capital asset infrastructure  such as manufacturing equipment  fleet  and facilities 
through the s  we grew rapidly and profitably 
in  we determined that we needed a course change to address the internet  and we invested heavily in internet technologies and services in the following years 
as a result  we were not profitable from the first quarter of to the third quarter of we returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of  the same quarter we released our new internet products which established the foundation of our current flagship product  datastream i 
we were profitable in and more so in as a result of the strength of our flagship product and cost reduction initiatives  and we expect to continue to be profitable in growth in profits for a software company is strongly tied to license revenues 
license revenues typically result in subsequent service and support revenues 
we intend to grow license revenue by increasing the size of our direct sales force and improving their productivity 
growth in profits is also strongly tied to product quality  functionality and performance  and we can only achieve this by continuing to invest in our product offering 
when we sell to a customer  we typically commit to an arrangement consisting of application licenses  services and support 
we will also sell services to host the licensed application 
during  we experienced higher support revenue per customer  which was an important factor in our profitability 
our support revenue is a key source of recurring revenue and profitability in our business 
our gross margin  which measures net revenues less cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenues  improved in because of reduced services costs and increased support revenue as a percentage of our total revenues 
our operating margin  which measures operating income as a percentage of total revenues  improved in due largely to more effective marketing strategies and improved sales productivity 
our cost structure primarily consists of salaries  wages  and benefits provided to our employees 
traditionally  a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter had been the result of a large number of relatively small orders received during the period 
we expect the average size of our license sales transactions  however  to continue to increase in the coming years 
an increase in average deal size typically increases the length of an average sales cycle 
potential customers spend significant time and resources determining which software to purchase 
this requires us to spend substantial time  effort and money educating and convincing prospective customers to purchase our software 
a customer s decision to license our software generally involves evaluation by a number of the customer s personnel in various functional and geographic areas 
due to these and other factors  our sales cycle may be extended 
since the sales cycle can be unpredictable and can be affected by events beyond our control  we cannot always forecast the timing or amount of specific sales  and sales may vary from quarter to quarter 
we expect to experience a decline in the large number of relatively small orders that has been a staple of our marketing and sales efforts in the past 

table of contents we typically see weaker service revenues in the third and fourth quarters of our calendar year due to lower utilization from europe in the summer and fewer available billable days in the november and december months due to holidays and customer site shutdowns 
the first and third quarters have traditionally been weaker for license sales  but this has become harder to predict given larger deals sizes and less predictable sales cycles associated with datastream i 
this seasonality may cause our results to vary from quarter to quarter 
international revenues were approximately million or of total revenues in  compared to million  or of total revenues in  and compared to approximately million  or of total revenues  in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs set forth our statement of operations data for the three years ended december   and  the percentage change in such data from period to period for each of the corresponding periods and the percentage that such data bears to total revenues for each period 
compared to compared to revenues year ended december  percent change in thousands  except percentage data product revenue percentage of total revenues professional services and support percentage of total revenues total revenues product revenue product revenues consist of all software product sales including datastream i  datastream i buy  and legacy products such as mp we have one reportable segment and sell products out of eighteen different sales offices worldwide 
the slight decrease in product revenue compared to product revenue is due to the continued transition from legacy products to datastream i 
the legacy products decrease was slightly higher than the increase in datastream i sales in compared to in an effort to improve product revenue growth  we announced the appointment of john sterling  iii to the position of executive vice president of worldwide sales in october the slight increase in over was driven by the transition to datastream i  which has a higher average deal size 
professional services and support revenue professional services revenue includes consulting fees for product implementation and training 
support revenue includes fees charged to customers for technical  customer and application hosting services associated with the support of our products 
professional service revenue declined approximately in compared to and in compared to  due to increased partnering with third party service providers and increased market competition 
support revenue increased approximately in each of and as compared to the prior year due to high support renewal rates and increased average support agreements associated with the larger sale sizes of datastream i

the increase in as compared with was a result of increased sales of third party products in conjunction with datastream i license sales 
the decrease in as compared with was due to the decrease in smaller sized license sales which typically have higher cost of sales  in the aggregate 
cost of professional services and support revenues the cost of professional services includes employee related costs and the related costs incurred to provide consulting services and training to customers 
the cost of support revenues consists of employee related costs to provide on going support 
the decreases as a percentage of revenue in and as compared to the prior year were due to improved returns on professional per day rates and reductions in service personnel expenditures 
operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  percent change in thousands  except percentage data sales and marketing percentage of total revenues sales and marketing expenses include printed advertising  web advertising  conference and trade shows  direct mail marketing  publicity expense and salary and related expenses 
the decreases in and as compared to the prior year were a result of a reduction in print and mail based advertising  a reduction in tradeshows  and lower employee related expenses in sales and marketing due primarily to reduced headcount 
product development year ended december  percent change in thousands  except percentage data product development percentage of total revenues product development costs consist of employee related expenses  contract labor expenses  and the allocation of general expenses related to the development of our products 
the increase in as compared to was a result of the development of datastream i extended and datastream i for the microsoft sql server database 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to reduced personnel expenditures and efficiencies gained by our move to a single development platform 

table of contents general and administrative year ended december  percent change in thousands  except percentage data general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance  human resources and information services 
the increase as compared to was a result of an increase in salary and salary related expenses and miscellaneous utility expenses  offset by a decrease in bad debt expense

no such charges were incurred in or other income expense year ended december  percent change in thousands  except percentage data net other income expense 
 n m percentage of total revenues n m not meaningful other income expense includes costs incurred that are not related our normal course of business operations 
typically  this is interest income expense and gains losses on assets and liabilities not used in the normal course of business

see the discussion related to dovebid  inc under liquidity and capital resources

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we fund our operating activities primarily with cash generated from operations 
our primary uses of cash are employee compensation and related expenses  marketing expenditures  overhead items such as rent and utilities  and capital expenditures such as computers  servers  network systems and building improvements 
our primary sources of cash are collections of license  service and support revenues 
we ended with million in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase from million in we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december  we generated positive cash from operations primarily through increased profits  collections of accounts receivable from earned and unearned revenue  and the invoicing and collection of unbilled revenues in excess of cash payments for operating expenditures 
increases in cash were offset by various timing differences due to the payment of liabilities expensed in and tax payments of approximately million 
the increased collections of accounts receivable in compared to was due to improved process management and better customer satisfaction 
unbilled revenue decreased upon the completion of several larger service projects 
in  we used approximately million in investing activities primarily related to building improvements and purchases of technical assets such as computers  servers and network systems 
cash provided from financing activities was approximately  from the receipt of approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from stock issuances under employee purchase plan  offset by million in purchases of treasury stock through our share repurchase plans 
we believe that our capital expenditures for property and equipment in will be approximately of total revenues 
however  the actual capital expenditures for property and equipment in may change as business conditions fluctuate 
our research and development costs are likely to be higher in  but could be lower due to market conditions 
research and development costs may change as business conditions fluctuate 
we plan to continue to purchase shares of our stock under the current stock repurchase program 
the current plan expires in august cash provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december  we generated positive cash from operations through invoicing and collection of unbilled revenue related to the completion of certain international projects 
we increased our liquidity by applying tax credits in lieu of cash for our tax obligations 
we also generated positive cash from operations from prepayments of support and hosting services 
in  we used approximately million in investing activities primarily related to purchases of technical assets such as computers  servers and network systems 
cash used in financing activities was approximately  resulting from million in purchases of treasury stock through our share repurchase plans offset by the receipt of  from the exercise of stock options and from stock issuances under the employee purchase plan 
cash provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december  we received a large tax refund in  which became the primary contributor to cash provided by operating activities for the year 
we also generated positive cash from operations through collections of accounts receivable offset by significant cash payments for expenditures made in the prior year 
the reduction in accounts receivable was due to improved management of our account receivable process 
the cash payments for expenditures made in the prior year occurred as we completed much of the spending commitments associated with our investments in e commerce and the internet in in  we used approximately million investing activities primarily related to additions of technical assets such as computers  servers and network systems 
cash used in financing activities was approximately million resulting primarily from million in purchases of treasury stock through our share repurchase plans  offset by the receipt of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from stock issuances under employee purchase plan 
in march  we made a million investment in dovebid  inc dovebid 
this investment represents less than of the outstanding capital stock of dovebid 
on august   datastream received notice from dovebid that it intended to raise additional financing which would be dilutive to datastream s ownership position in dovebid and at an implied valuation below the carrying value of datastream s million investment 
accordingly  datastream decreased its long term investment to  from million and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million through other income expense  net 
it is unknown if any further adjustments to the carrying value of our investment in dovebid will occur in future periods 
we maintain a singapore line of credit for sgd  approximately  which bears interest at over the singapore dollar prime lending rate 
the outstanding borrowings were sgd  approximately  under the line of credit as of december  on february  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of datastream s outstanding common stock 
during the first three quarters of  we repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of  the repurchased shares were added to the  treasury shares cost of  repurchased in under a separate stock repurchase plan 
this plan expired during the third 
table of contents quarter of fiscal on october  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
we repurchased  shares of common stock at a cost of  before the plan expired on april  on july  we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
we repurchased  shares under this stock repurchase plan at a cost of  before this plan expired on july  the repurchased shares under these three plans were used for general corporate purposes  including grants of employee stock options 
the shares are classified as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet and are reported at cost 
on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a plan to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
this plan expires august  subject to availability  the repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or otherwise at prices that we deem appropriate 
the repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares on the balance sheet and are reported at cost 
the shares may be used  when needed  for general corporate purposes  including the grant of stock options 
we repurchased  shares for  overall and  shares for  during the fourth quarter of the aggregate number of shares repurchased under all prior and current plans was  as of december  in connection with entering into a software development and licensing agreement with ge fanuc north america  inc ge fanuc  on february   we issued a warrant to ge fanuc to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
the warrant was exercisable on the date of issuance and remains exercisable for three years from the date of issuance 
the exercise price per share is  which was the market price of our common stock on the date of issuance of the warrant 
the warrant agreement allows for net share settlement and provides piggy back registration rights for the underlying common stock 
we have accounted for the warrant using the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and eitf  vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
as a result  on the date of issuance we recorded the fair value of the warrant as a credit to additional paid in capital and a debit to prepaid commissions 
we will record amortization of the prepaid commissions as a reduction of revenue over the three years the warrant is exercisable 
the impact to our financial condition has been and is expected to continue to be insignificant over the three year period 
as of december   we had no material commitments for debt or capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of the sec s regulation s k 
aggregate contractual obligations our commitments as of december  consist of obligations under our operating leases 
lease commitments we lease certain of our facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating lease arrangements that expire at various dates through the leases are all standard short term operating leases 
rent expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments under non cancelable lease agreements as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations 
table of contents indemnification obligations in the regular course of our business  we contract to provide indemnification to our customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
under our bylaws  we indemnify our directors  officers and employees for certain events or occurrences while the director  officer or employee is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification applies to all pertinent events and occurrences to the extent and under the circumstances permitted under delaware law 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited 
we have  however  director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
critical accounting estimates and policies in preparation of our financial statements we make estimates and assumptions that can significantly affect the reported amounts of net income and the value of certain assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting estimates are those that are material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for matters that are either highly uncertain or highly susceptible to change and have a material effect on our financial condition or operating performance 
we believe critical accounting estimates related to revenue recognition  income taxes and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable encompass critical judgments and our accounting policies provide a basis upon which management considers significant judgments and uncertainties  however  each of these judgments and estimates may potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition our revenues consist primarily of fees for product sales  professional services  hosting and customer support 
product revenues we generally recognize product revenues when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the total fee to the multiple elements of an arrangement 
fees are generally considered fixed or determinable upon receipt of a signed license agreement and completion of negotiations 
management strives to achieve net payment terms depending on market and customer specific conditions 
if payment terms on license fees extend beyond a period of time that is out of our historical collection period for each geographic region  then revenue is recognized as payments are received 
the amount of product revenues recognized is determined based on the residual amount of the multiple element contract value that is not assigned to other elements based on vsoe of those elements 
if acceptance terms for the licensed product exist  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
if it is determined that professional services are essential to the functionality of the product as delivered  then product revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
support revenues we recognize support revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates  ratably over the term of the contract support period  typically one year 
the amount of support revenue invoiced but not yet recognized is recorded as unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
support vsoe is either the stated contract renewal rate or the support renewal rate as a percentage of the past product sales if there is no stated contract renewal rate 
professional services revenues professional services revenues are primarily related to implementation  integration and training services performed on a time and materials basis or a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are performed unless there is a fixed fee for services 
fixed fee service revenues are recognized using contract accounting 
we estimate the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
the revenue and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
progress to completion is measured as total labor cost 
revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
we provide for project losses as they become known 
revenues from hosted software service arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement 
hosting services vsoe is either the stated contract renewal rate or the renewal rate as a percentage of the past product sales if there is no stated contract renewal rate 
professional services vsoe is based on the day rate we are able to negotiate when services are sold separate from a contract 
reimbursed expenses are recorded gross as revenue with an offsetting amount recorded to service cost of sales 
our standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
we provide a standard warranty of days from the date of sale 
we continually evaluate our obligations with respect to warranties  returns and refunds 
based on 
table of contents historical trends and management s evaluation of current conditions  any potential obligations that are inherent in the accounts receivable balance are adequately provided for through the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we may  in certain circumstances  grant discounts for product sales 
the discounts are recognized as a reduction of product revenue 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a regular basis for each taxable jurisdiction 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers all available evidence  both positive and negative in making this assessment 
positive evidence supporting the realizability of our deferred tax assets include our strong earnings history prior to operating losses realized in  the ability to carryback losses to prior years  positive results in recent years  projections of future taxable income in  the existence of significantly appreciated net assets and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable amounts 
our pre tax operating losses in represent negative evidence with respect to the realizability of our deferred taxes assets 
however  such losses included infrequent litigation settlements  non taxable goodwill amortization and impairment charges  and losses related to our investment in the e commerce market which are not expected to continue 
in order to realize virtually all of the deferred tax assets  we will need to generate future federal taxable income of approximately  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards commencing in based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  in the future  if we determine that we expect to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the recorded net amounts  a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
alternatively  if we determine that we no longer expect to realize a portion of our net deferred tax assets  an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  we review the rolling twelve month average of account write offs  customer specific account risks  accounts receivable aging  and geographic specific factors that may impact international accounts 
these factors combine to establish the allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain a summary of significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

risk factors from time to time  we make oral and written statements that may constitute forward looking statements rather than historical facts as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of or by the sec in its rules  regulations and releases  including section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the exchange act

the following is a summary of certain risks and uncertainties identified by us in the conduct of our business and is not meant to be exhaustive 
these risk factors should also be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that we make in this annual report as well as other risks and uncertainties identified from time to time in our other sec reports  registrations statements and public announcements 
see also safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of at the beginning of this annual report 
our market continues to be highly competitive 
our market continues to be highly competitive 
we expect competition to intensify as new companies enter the market and existing ones expand their product lines 
certain competitors  including enterprise resource planning  or erp  companies  have greater financial  marketing  technical  and service and support resources than we do 
in addition  many prospective customers have already made significant commitments to erp competitors  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to succeed in our market 
further  slowing us and world economies could result in a decrease in spending by corporations on information technology and software 
this could lead to even greater competition in our markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors  especially if customers or prospective customers decrease their level of spending on asset management products in a slowing economy 
if we fail to compete successfully  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes and demands in our markets  we will not remain competitive 
our business is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions 
our future success depends greatly on our ability to enhance certain of our existing products 
our success also depends on our ability to develop and introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products and product features to meet our customers changing needs  particularly involving internet based applications 
industry requirements for product development in our market are still evolving 
our ability to successfully and efficiently develop products that meet these evolving requirements will require high levels of innovation  as well as an accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
in addition  certain competitors may be able to devote greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources to identify and meet the evolving industry requirements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify  develop  and market new products or product enhancements that comply with evolving industry requirements or achieve market acceptance 
if we do not successfully identify  develop  and market new products or product enhancements  it could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 
increasing sales cycles and other factors may result in volatility of our quarterly results 
traditionally  a significant portion of our revenues in any quarter had been the result of a large number of relatively small orders received during the period 
we expect the average size of our license sales transactions  however  to continue to increase in the coming years 
an increase in average deal size typically increases the length of the average sales cycle 
potential customers spend significant time and resources determining which software to purchase 
this requires us to spend substantial time  effort and money educating and convincing prospective 
table of contents customers to purchase our software 
a customer s decision to license our software generally involves evaluation by a number of the customer s personnel in various functional and geographic areas 
due to these and other factors  our sales cycle may be extended 
since the sales cycle can be unpredictable and can be affected by events beyond our control  we cannot always forecast the timing or amount of specific sales  and sales may vary from quarter to quarter 
further  we typically realize a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses in the last month of a quarter  frequently even in the last days of a quarter 
this makes it difficult to gauge the level of license revenue we will have in any quarter until near to  or after  its conclusion 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for any quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results 
in addition  the market for our asset management software has changed dramatically over the last several years  and we expect that it will continue that trend as technology advances continue 
as our average license sale size has grown  we have shifted the primary focus of our sales and marketing efforts upon the enterprise wide deployment of datastream i 
we expect to experience a decline in the large number of relatively small orders that has been a staple of our marketing and sales efforts in the past 
we have restructured our sales and marketing organizations to facilitate this move to the higher end transactional model 
there can be no guarantee  however  that we will ultimately be successful in making this transition 
also  the overall demand for enterprise asset management software may grow more slowly than we anticipate or even decrease in upcoming quarters 
we have reported fluctuations in software license revenue in each of the last three years  as we make this transition to predominately higher end transactions 
this may be an indication of the extent of market penetration into the asset management software market  as well as a retrenchment in the way companies purchase enterprise software 
to the extent that a slow down in the market for enterprise asset management software develops  it could have a materially adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
other factors which could contribute to a fluctuation in our quarterly results include but are not limited to the following changes in demand for our products and services and market acceptance of new products  competitive conditions in the industry  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  changes in customer budgets  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in our sales and marketing organization  product life cycles and rotations  technological changes in computer systems and environments  variability in new licenses obtained  loss of customers  changes in the proportion of revenues attributable to licensing fees versus services  changes in the level of operating expenses  delay or deferral of customer implementations of their software  deferral of certain product and or service revenue to subsequent reporting periods to comply with revenue recognition accounting requirements  foreign currency exchange rates  and other economic conditions generally or in our particular industry 
due to these factors  our operating results could fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the price of our common stock could decline materially 
our engagements typically require longer implementations and other professional services engagements 
our implementations generally involve an extensive period of delivery of professional services  including the configuration of the solutions  together with customer training and consultation 
in addition  existing customers for other professional services projects often retain us for those projects beyond an initial implementation 
a successful implementation or other professional services project requires a close working relationship between us  the customer and often third party consultants and systems integrators who assist in the process 
these factors may increase the costs associated with completion of any given sale  increase the risks of collection of amounts due during 
table of contents implementations or other professional services projects  and increase risks of delay of such projects 
delays in the completion of an implementation or any other professional services project may require that the revenues associated with such implementation or project be recognized over a longer period than originally anticipated  or may result in disputes with customers regarding performance as originally anticipated 
such delays in the implementation may cause material fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  customers may defer implementation projects or portions of such projects  typically at any time without penalty  and such deferrals could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our hosting services strategy may reduce profits 
we cannot assure you that our hosting service customers will remain customers over a sustained period of time 
a successful hosting service offering must be accessible to customers continually  without disruptions 
we cannot provide assurances that the technical infrastructure employed by hosting service customers or prospective hosting service customers is sufficiently robust to prevent disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party managed services provider 
further  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure of the internet  or the complementary services necessary to provide these continual and expanding services will be adequate to meet our needs in providing our hosting service on a competitive basis 
such connectivity and related issues could adversely affect the growth and customer acceptance of our hosting service business model 
in addition  while our traditional business model charges an up front license fee for access to our software applications  one of the offerings available through our hosting service business model charges a significantly lower monthly fee for rights to the same application for a defined term 
certain customers may choose a monthly revenue model as opposed to an up front license fee 
as a result  this subscription model  if widely adopted by our customers  could significantly lower revenue and profits in the near term 
our electronic procurement product strategy may not generate future revenue and profits 
our datastream i buy product enables our customers to direct mro procurement to a select group of mro suppliers via the internet 
the market for products comparable to datastream i buy is competitive and there can be no assurances that we will successfully generate sufficient license and service revenue from this initiative 
also  we charge mro suppliers a transaction fee for each transaction executed through the datastream i buy network 
there can be no assurances that this transaction fee model will be profitable or sustainable in the long term 
the market for internet based mro procurement has experienced considerable change over the past several years and the customer demand for this area has been significantly reduced 
as we continue to market and sell the datastream i buy initiative  particularly internationally  we may be required to augment our technical infrastructure to meet the requirements of customers for mro procurement solutions 
if we are not successful in any of these areas  it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
significant delays in product development would harm our reputation as an innovator and result in a decrease in our revenues 
if we experience significant product development delays  our position in the market would be harmed  and our revenues could be substantially reduced  which would adversely affect our operating results 
historically  we have issued significant new releases of our software products periodically  with minor interim releases issued more frequently 
as a result of the complexities inherent in our software  major new product enhancements and new products often require long development and test periods before they are released 
on occasion  we have experienced delays in the scheduled release date of new or enhanced products  and we cannot assure you that these delays will not occur in the future 
delays may occur for many reasons  including an inability to hire a sufficient number of developers  discovery of bugs and errors  or a failure of our current or future products to conform to industry requirements 
any such delay  or the failure of new products or enhancements in achieving market acceptance  could materially impact our business and reputation and result in a decrease in our revenues 
our success is substantially dependent on third party relationships 
a principal element of our strategy is to establish and maintain alliances with other companies  such as system integrators  resellers  consultants  and suppliers of mro products and services 
these relationships enhance our status in the marketplace  which generates new business opportunities and marketing channels and  in certain cases  additional revenue and profitability 
our inability to establish and maintain alliances with other companies could impact our success in the marketplace  which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
in 
table of contents addition  as we cannot control the actions of these third party alliances  if these companies suffer business downturns or fail to meet their objectives  we may experience a resulting diminished revenue and decline in results of operations 
we have entered into a strategic agreement with ibm corporation under which we have undertaken to integrate our respective products and to market the ibm versions of our products in preference to other versions 
our license revenue may be affected by the success and acceptance of the ibm websphere and db products relative to those of ibm s competitors 
we may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of the ibm version of our products  and difficulties in integrating and coordinating our products and sales efforts with those of ibm 
in addition  customers or prospects that have not adopted the ibm technology platform may view our alliance with ibm negatively  and competitive alliances may emerge among other companies that are more attractive to our customers and prospective customers 
the success of datastream i buy is substantially dependent upon our strategic relationships with certain spare parts suppliers and service providers who pay a transaction fee for orders placed through the datastream i buy network 
we have more than strategic supplier agreements  none of which represent significant revenues 
our third party suppliers and service providers may not view their relationships with us as significant to their own business  and they may reassess their commitment to  or decide to compete directly with us for our customers procurement in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any of these relationships will be successful in the long term 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to establish new agreements  that these agreements can be renewed on commercially acceptable terms or that any relationships  if established  will be commercially successful 
our hosting service business model depends heavily on managed services provided by a third party 
to be successful  the hosted application must be accessible to customers continually  without any disruptions 
if our third party service provider fails to provide consistent access of the application to our customers  it would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that there will not be disruptions in internet services beyond our control or that of our third party managed services provider 
further  we cannot assure you that the infrastructure of the internet  or the complementary services necessary to provide these continual and expanding services will be adequate to meet our needs in providing our hosting service on a competitive basis 
as we expand our hosting service and datastream i buy offerings internationally  we may need to augment our existing technical infrastructure on a global or regional basis  to provide the complete array of services and availability that hosting customers require 
our future success is substantially dependent on third party technologies 
we rely heavily on third parties that supply us with certain technologies that are crucial to our success 
in particular  our line of internet based applications is highly dependent on oracle technology  including oracle database technology and development tools 
we are also dependent on microsoft sql server and internet explorer 
if such technology does not achieve continued market acceptance or if oracle were to develop application software that successfully competed with our application software  it could have a material adverse effect on the acceptance of our products  and thus our results of operations 
we also expect to increasingly depend on third party technology that facilitates the integration of our products with other systems of our clients 
this integration is crucial to our success 
the market for integration solutions and technology to implement enterprise wide web services is rapidly changing and intensely competitive 
there are a variety of methods to integrate software applications and to implement web services 
we expect that competition will remain intense as the number of entrants increases and new technologies emerge 
we cannot assure you that third parties will continue to develop new versions of products that successfully facilitate this integration 
we also cannot assure you that that the third party technology licenses we depend upon or suitable alternatives will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
as we continue to introduce new products that incorporate new technologies  we may license additional technology from additional third parties 
any failure to obtain any of these technology upgrades or licenses could result in delays or reductions in the introduction of new products  features or functions  which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents our business could be substantially harmed if we have to correct or delay the release of products due to software bugs or errors 
our software products may contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our software products may also contain undetected viruses 
further  software we license from third parties and incorporate into our products may contain errors  bugs or viruses 
errors  bugs or viruses may cause a loss of or delay in market acceptance  recalls of hardware products incorporating the software or loss of data 
any such defects and errors could result in any of the following adverse customer reactions  negative publicity regarding our business and our products  harm to our reputation  loss of or delay in market acceptance  loss of revenue or required product changes  diversion of development resources and increased development expenses  increased service and warranty costs  legal action by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
if we fail to manage our international operations  our business could be adversely affected 
we generate our international sales through our international sales subsidiaries  as well as through a variety of indirect sales and marketing channel alliances 
our business  and our ability to maintain and expand our operations internationally  is subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including  in particular difficulty in staffing and managing an organization spread over various countries  greater difficulty in safeguarding our intellectual property  acceptance of localized versions of our products  cultural differences in the conduct of business  maintaining uniform administrative controls in each country in accounting for customer contractual commitments  general economic and political conditions in each country  fluctuating economic and political conditions affecting geographic regions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  increased trade restrictions  changes in tariff rates  longer accounts receivable payment cycles in certain countries  product compliance with local language and business customs  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand internationally  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in the past  we acquired several international businesses 
our inability to successfully grow these international acquisitions resulted in goodwill impairment  which has had a significant adverse affect on the results of operations 
in addition  as a result of these acquisitions  we are more deeply involved with international markets that are less familiar 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully compete in these international markets 
we anticipate that our future results of operations may be subject to quarterly variations as a result  in part  of the seasonal revenue fluctuations in europe  asia and latin america  principally consisting of slower business conditions in the first and third quarters of the year 
further  we conduct virtually all of our business in us dollars  european euros  japanese yen  united kingdom pound sterling  singapore and australian dollars  argentinean  chilean and mexican pesos  brazilian real  and chinese renminbi 
changes in the value of these currencies relative to the dollar could negatively impact our financial condition 
we do not engage in hedging transactions  and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion to us dollars could adversely affect the us dollar equivalent value of the foreign denominated cash 

table of contents in trying to increase our sales to the public sector  we may face difficulties and risks unique to government contracts that may have a detrimental impact on our business or operating results 
we are expanding our customer base to include more entities and agencies within the us government and state and local governments 
developing new business in the public sector often requires companies to develop relationships with different agencies or entities  as well as with other government contractors 
if we are unable to develop or sustain these relationships  we may be unable to procure new contracts within the timeframe we expect  and our business and financial results may be adversely affected 
contracting with the us government often requires businesses to participate in a highly competitive bidding process to obtain new contracts 
we may be unable to bid competitively if our software or services are improperly priced  or if we are incapable of providing our software and services at a competitive price 
the bidding process is an expensive and time consuming endeavor that may result in a financial loss for datastream if we fail to win a contract on which we submitted a bid 
further  some agencies within the us government may also require some or all of our personnel to obtain a security clearance or may require us to add features or functionality to our software 
if our key personnel are unable to obtain or retain this clearance or if we cannot or do not provide required features or functionality  we may be unsuccessful in our bid for some government contracts 
contracts with the governmental entities also frequently include provisions not found in the private sector and are often governed by laws and regulations that do not affect private contracts 
these differences may permit the public sector customer to take actions not available to customers in the private sector 
this may include termination of current contracts for convenience or due to a default 
the us government can also suspend operations if congress does not allocate sufficient funds  and the us government may allow our competitors to protest our successful bids 
if any of these events occur  they may negatively affect our business and financial results 
in order to maintain contracts with the us government  we must also comply with many rules and regulations that may affect our relationship with other customers 
the us government can terminate its contract with us if we come under foreign government control or influence  may require that we disclose our pricing data during the course of negotiations  and may require us to prevent access to classified data 
if the us government requires us to meet any of these demands  it could result in increased costs or an inability to take advantage of certain opportunities that may present themselves in the future 
us government agencies routinely investigate and audit government contractors administrative processes 
they may audit our performance and our pricing  and review our compliance with rules and regulations 
if they find that we have improperly allocated costs  they may require us to refund those costs or may refuse to pay us for outstanding balances related to the improper allocation 
an unfavorable audit could result in a reduction of revenue  and may result in civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities 
this could harm our business  financial results and reputation 
deterioration of economic and political conditions could adversely affect operations 
over the past several quarters  the united states and regional economies around the world have experienced recession or similar economic conditions 
the continuing downturn in economic conditions has led to a reduced demand for a variety of goods and services  including software and other technology products 
while we have been relatively successful in selling in this economic climate over the past year  if conditions decline further or fail to improve  we could experience a decrease in the overall demand for our software and services that could harm our operating results 
in addition  as we have operational presence in the united states  as well as throughout europe  latin america  and the pacific rim  we are subject to the economic and political uncertainties that may be associated with the threat of terrorism or military action taken by the united states or its allies in response to that threat 
these risks include the possibility that our customers may cancel  defer or limit purchases as a result of such threat or the response to it  and the possibility that air travel delays or cancellations and restrictions imposed by companies could adversely affect our licensing efforts or our services revenue  as they result in our inability to visit customer sites or customers inability to visit our offices 
in the current uncertain economic and political environment  our revenue and our license revenue in particular  is difficult to forecast and will likely be less predictable from quarter to quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we probably will not be able to reduce our operating expenses quickly in response 
thus  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter 

table of contents our product strategy depends on the continued acceptance of the internet for business transactions 
as we continue to develop and market internet based products  our success will increasingly depend on the continued use and development of the internet as a tool for the transaction of business 
we cannot assure you that the infrastructure or complementary services necessary to maintain the internet will sufficiently address the requirements of our products or the demands of our marketplace 
if the internet fails as a medium for business transactions  it would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we must recruit and retain key employees in order to be successful 
our continued success depends on the services of several of our key executive  sales and marketing and technical employees 
the loss of the services of these personnel  particularly those of larry g 
blackwell  our founder  chairman  chief executive officer and president  or our inability to attract and retain other qualified management  sales and marketing and technical employees  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we do not maintain any key man life insurance policy with respect to mr 
blackwell 
our success also depends in part on our ability to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  with appropriate levels of managerial and technical capabilities 
our business generally requires a significant level of expertise to effectively develop and market our products and services 
we have at times experienced  and continue to experience  difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
we believe that the pool of potential applicants with such requisite expertise is limited 
recruiting qualified personnel is an intensely competitive and time consuming process 
such competition has resulted in demands for increased compensation from qualified applicants 
due to such competition  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  turnover in personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to conduct and expand our operations successfully 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to attract  hire  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights  it could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenues 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  software licenses  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary technology 
we generally enter into confidentiality and or license agreements with our key employees  consultants  distributors and strategic affiliates as well as with our customers and potential customers seeking proprietary information 
we also limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken in this regard  however  will be adequate to deter misappropriation or independent third party development of our technology 
further  we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future with respect to our current or future products 
any claims or litigation  even those without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  diversion of management s attention and cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such claims or litigation also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
litigation to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  regardless of the final outcome of such litigation 
we may be subject to additional risks as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or are poorly enforced 
legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
security risks and concerns may deter the use of the internet for our applications 
a significant barrier to communications is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems or those of other web sites to protect proprietary information 
if any well publicized compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the internet for our market 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network  and data is sent over 
table of contents this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers  have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers  which could disrupt datastream i buy or make it inaccessible to customers or suppliers 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
to the extent that our activities may involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business would be harmed if we do not prevent them 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering and may continue to do so 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in april the common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market  which has experienced and is likely to experience significant price and volume fluctuations  which could adversely affect the market price of the common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results  the overall economy and the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law may inhibit a takeover  which may not be in the interests of stockholders 
there are several provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and delaware corporate law that may inhibit a takeover  even when a takeover may be in the interests of our stockholders 
for example  our board of directors is empowered to issue preferred stock without shareholder action 
the existence of this blank check preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an effort to obtain control of the company by means of a tender offer  merger  proxy contest or otherwise 
our articles of incorporation also divide the board of directors into three classes  as nearly equal in size as possible  with staggered three year terms 
the classification of the board of directors could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of datastream because only one third of the board is up for election each year 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware general corporate law that relate to business combinations with interested shareholders  which can serve to inhibit a takeover 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risk to which we are exposed that may adversely impact results of operations and financial position is fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
in  revenue generated outside the united states accounted for approximately of total revenue 
significant revenues ie  greater than of total revenues were derived in france and the netherlands and singapore  with the balance derived primarily from the eleven remaining countries argentina  brazil  chile  china  germany  italy  japan  mexico  united kingdom and uruguay in which we maintain subsidiary or branch operations 
many of our foreign sales were denominated in the currencies of the local country 
as such  our reported profits and cash flows are exposed to changing exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
historically  exchange rate exposure has been minimal  however  management is evaluating alternatives to reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in the value of the us dollar in the foreign exchange markets 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies would have resulted in an immaterial difference to our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the currencies in which we generate foreign denominated sales are geographically widespread and individually represent relatively low dollar exposure 
local currency revenues generated by our foreign subsidiaries are used to pay local currency expenses 
at any point in time  our foreign operations hold financial assets and liabilities that are denominated in the local currency 
these financial assets and liabilities consist primarily of short term  third party and intercompany receivables and payables 
at december   cash denominated in foreign currencies was approximately million 
long term investments 
we have an investment security in the preferred stock of a private company 
we evaluate the fair value of its investment on a periodic basis 
significant changes to the fair value could cause a decline in the value of the investment
