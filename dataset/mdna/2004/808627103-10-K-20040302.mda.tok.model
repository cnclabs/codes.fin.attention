item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and related financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription products 
our current operating plan focuses on maximizing the sales of our existing product portfolio 
we plan to accelerate growth by launching line extensions to our current products and acquiring or licensing approved products or late stage development products 
we plan to focus on products that fit within the cardiology and women s health pediatric categories that will allow us to leverage our existing sales force infrastructure 
we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers who in turn distribute to pharmacies  chain drug stores  other retail merchandisers and  on a limited basis  directly to pharmacies 
we recognize revenue when our products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss 
our sales force targets high prescribing primary care physicians and select specialty physicians 
our sales force seeks to develop close relationships with these physicians and respond to their needs and the needs of their patients 
these physicians  in turn  write prescriptions for our products in order to treat their patients 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts by monitoring prescription trends of our promoted products 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million to for  compared to for this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million or in general product sales primarily as a result of i the reduction of the levels of trade inventories for a majority of our promoted products including sular  nitrolingual  tanafed dp  ponstel and robinul and ii a decline in sales of our non promoted products 
in late  our wholesaler customers purchased what we believe to be excessive amounts of inventory of our products in anticipation of future price increases 
this adversely impacted our sales in the first half of in response  in the second and third quarters of  we entered into inventory management agreements with our three largest wholesale customers which offer incentives to the wholesaler to maintain on average one month of inventory 
trade levels of our promoted products were approximately one month at december  a reduction of recorded liability for estimated product returns of million in compared to million in  which resulted in an increase in net revenues 
in connection with the acquisition of rights for robinul  ponstel  cognex  prenate  furadantin and sular  we assumed certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the respective acquisition dates  we estimated the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and included that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we periodically review the estimated liability and reduce it if actual returns have been lower than expected 
generally  no adjustment is made to the reserve until two to three years subsequent to the acquisition due to the lag time between when a product is sold and when it is returned 
an decrease in net revenues of million resulting from a reduction in the accrual for estimated future returns of our tanafed suspension products  in compared to million in in september  we launched tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  line extensions to our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm products 
these line extensions were launched in response to increasing competition by knock off products to tanafed suspension and tanafed dm 
due to the launch of tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  we expected increased returns of tanafed suspension  as prescriptions were expected to be filled with the line extensions 
we estimated returns of approximately million and provided for this amount in in april  we decided to withdraw tanafed suspension and tanafed dm from the market 
the decision to withdraw tanafed suspension in april was earlier than planned 
additionally  we also decided to withdraw tanafed dm 
as a result  we expect to incur an additional million in returns of tanafed suspension and tanafed dm and have provided for this amount in the results of operations for a reduction in the recorded liability for medicaid rebates  of million in  which had the effect of increasing net revenues 
in connection with the acquisition of rights for sular  we became responsible for medicaid rebates for product sales after the acquisition date 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  any rebate invoices received by the seller would be paid by the seller and reimbursed by first horizon 
when we began selling sular in march  we began accruing for these medicaid rebates 
the rebate accrual rate was developed using historical information provided by the seller 
from march to december  we had accrued a liability of approximately million 
in december  the seller requested reimbursement of million 
as a result  we reduced our liability for medicaid rebates for sular and increased revenue 
product overview change in total dispensed prescriptions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a sular nitrolingual b prenate line tanafed line robinul line ponstel a source ims health s national prescription audit plus data b we believe that ims data does not capture prescriptions of nitrolingual from some of the non retail channels and prescription trends in the non retail channel which may have a significant impact on the reported change 
product sales of sular  excluding the reversal of medicaid rebate liability of million  were approximately million for compared to million for we acquired sular in march this decline in product sales was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of sular held by our wholesaler customers during product sales of the promoted women s health pediatric products namely the prenate line  the tanafed line  the robinul line and ponstel  were approximately million for compared to approximately million for this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of inventory during and lower revenues of the prenate line due to increased substitution of knock off products by pharmacies 
commencing during the second quarter of  we experienced significant erosion of prenate gt sales due to increased substitution of knock off products by pharmacies filling prescriptions for prenate gt 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  substitution rates as measured by total dispensed prescriptions captured by prenate gt and knock off products were for the quarter ended december  compared to for the quarter ended december  as part of our operational plan of maximizing sales of our existing products  we are exploring new line extensions for the prenate line in an effort to reduce this substitution rate 
product sales of nitrolingual decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in trade levels of inventory during the year partially offset by price increases taken during during the second quarter of  we launched a dose application bottle of nitrolingual 
the dose bottle is smaller and more convenient to carry for some patients than the currently marketed dose bottle 
we believe that the dose bottle will benefit patients who have mild angina and whose episodes are occasional 
we believe the smaller bottle is an excellent companion product to the dose bottle 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased million to million for compared to million in cost of revenues includes an increase to our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory of million in compared to in these charges in were primarily for our non promoted products  excess sular and tanafed inventory and short dated prenate gt inventory 
in  the charges were the result of tanafed suspension inventory becoming obsolete due to the launch of line extensions and lower than expected sales of prenate gt 
gross margin for was compared to for this increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a change in product sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for  compared to million for selling related expenses decreased due to lower co promotion expenses incurred for promotion of our sular product due to the termination of a co promotion agreement in the second quarter of  as well as lower selling expense as a result of our revised operating plan 
the decrease was partially offset  by increased expenses for an allowance for obsolete sample inventory  shipping cost related to the withdrawal of tanafed suspension and tanafed dm and severance for departing employees 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for compared to million for this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of sular in march and higher depreciation expense related to our implementation of new financial systems in impairment charge 
in the second quarter of  we revised our revenue forecast for all of our products and evaluated the remaining estimated useful lives of our intangible assets 
as a result  we changed the remaining estimated useful life of the cognex intangible assets from years to years 
an analysis of the projected undiscounted cash flows for all intangibles was performed as required by sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the analysis of the projected undiscounted cash flows for cognex indicated that the carrying value of the asset was not recoverable over the revised remaining useful life of the asset 
we estimated the fair market value of the cognex assets 
based on the estimated fair market value  it was determined that the carrying value of the cognex licensing rights was in excess of the fair value and an impairment charge of million was recorded 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million to million for compared to million for the increase in expense is primarily a result of costs associated with manufacturing transfers for our ponstel  cognex and furadantin products and development costs for the prenate line 
in late  the fda issued a notice about various cough and cold combination products  which we believe requires us to obtain fda approval of our tanafed products before january  in order to be able to thereafter continue to market and sell these products as prescription products 
in october  the fda issued a draft guidance document to address their current approach to handling compliance issues for drugs marketed without fda approval 
we have not yet determined the estimated cost to obtain fda approval 
we are performing early phase clinical trials that are required for fda approval regardless of the eventual prescription versus over the counter status 
based on the findings of the planned phase trial  we will finalize our development strategy and seek a pre ind meeting with the fda 
we may incur significant developmental expenses to obtain fda approval or may begin marketing tanafed products as non prescription products  which could have a material adverse effect on net revenues and profit margins for the tanafed product line 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for compared to million for we had no debt outstanding in interest expense in was the result of amortization of capitalized loan costs and unused facility fees relating to our million line of credit 
interest expense in was primarily the result of a credit facility obtained in march to finance the acquisition of sular 
we repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility in the second quarter of and terminated this credit facility in july as a result of sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections results for have been reclassified to state what was previously reported as an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of million net of taxes 
to make this reclassification  interest expense for has been increased by million and the income tax provision was decreased by million 
interest income 
interest income was million for  compared to million for the decrease in interest income is primarily due to a lower average cash balance in benefit provision for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for  compared to the decrease in the effective rate is due primarily to the change in the ratio of non deductible expenses to pre tax income 
years ended december  and december  net revenues 
net revenues increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in general product sales of million to million for compared to for product sales of existing products namely  all products other than those launched or acquired after december  decreased million to million for  as compared to this decrease is due to lower net sales of tanafed suspension and our non promoted cognex and cough and cold products  partially offset by an increase in net sales of the robinul line and nitrolingual pumpspray 
sales of products launched or acquired after december  were million for we acquired the prenate line in august  furadantin in december and sular in march we launched the tanafed line extensions  tanafed dm  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx in january  september and september  respectively 
a decrease in net revenues of million resulting from an increase in the accrual for estimated future returns of our tanafed suspension product 
as a result of our launch of tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  we anticipated higher than normal returns of tanafed suspension 
net revenues for have no comparable adjustments for increased tanafed returns due to launches of line extensions 
product overview change in total prescriptions for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  a sular b nitrolingual c prenate line tanafed line robinul line ponstel a source ims health s national prescription audit plus data b we acquired the rights to sular in march c we believe that ims data does not capture prescriptions of nitrolingual from some of the non retail channels and prescription trends in the non retail channel which may have a significant impact on the reported change 
product sales of sular since its acquisition in march were approximately million 
wholesalers who purchase our products increased the levels of trade inventories significantly in the fourth quarter of  presumably in anticipation of future price increases 
product sales of nitrolingual increased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  sales of nitrolingual in were approximately below our goals primarily in the second and third quarter of because of the increased focus of our sales force on the launch of sular during these quarters 
product sales of the women s health pediatric products  which include the prenate line  the tanafed line  the robinul line and ponstel  were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was the result of increased sales of the prenate line which we acquired in august  offset by decreased sales of the tanafed line 
we experienced erosion of sales of our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm line of products during due to increased competition from knock off products resulting from pharmacists substituting such knock off products for prescriptions of our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm line of products 
in response to the knock off products  we launched two line extensions  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  in september in january we were issued a us patent that contains claims which protect tanafed dm  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx against knock off products 
we acquired the prenate line in august  introduced prenate gt in september and experienced erosion of sales of the products included in our prenate line during due to increased competition from knock off products resulting in pharmacists substituting such knock off products for prescriptions of our prenate line of products 
the substitution rate  as measured by total dispensed prescriptions captured by prenate gt and knock off products  was for the quarter ended december  source ims health s national prescription audit plus data 
product sales for the robinul line increased for the year ended compared to total prescriptions increased for robinul for the quarter ended december  as compared to the quarter ended september   which indicated a slowing of growth for this product 
product sales for our non promoted products increased in compared to this increase was the result of product sales of furadantin which we began selling in january  offset by decreases of product sales of the non promoted cough and cold products and cognex 
in addition  we experienced greater rates of returns for certain of our non promoted products in  which significantly reduced net sales of these products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for were million and includes an allowance for obsolete inventory for existing tanafed suspension and prenate gt inventory totaling million due to the introduction of tanafed line extensions in the third quarter of and lower than expected sales of prenate gt 
costs of revenues for the year ended december  of million do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete inventory 
for the year ended december  gross margins were compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the change in product sales mix and sular having a lower gross margin as compared to our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for to million  compared to million for as a percentage of net revenues from product sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for  as compared to for selling related expenses increased due to increased royalty expense due to higher net revenues of our nitrolingual  robinul and zebutal products on which we pay royalties  the expansion of our sales force in april  and higher training and marketing cost related to the launch of furadantin  sular  tanafed dp  tanafed dm and tanafed dmx during selling expenses also increased due to the outside commission and co promotion expenses paid for our prenate  sular  nitrolingual and robinul co promotions 
general and administrative expenses for increased due to increased support staff and operating expenses at our corporate headquarters  higher insurance costs  and higher state and local tax expense 
during we recorded estimated expenses for state and local taxes associated with prior periods of million 
these increased expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for compared to million for this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of prenate in august  furadantin in december  and sular in march as well as increased depreciation expense for new furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements at our corporate headquarters which we moved into in april research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased million to million for compared to million for research and development expenses were primarily related to the robinul line extension development project 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of the amortization of deferred financing costs and other interest expenses associated with the credit facility obtained on march  to finance the acquisition of sular 
as a result of sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections results for have been reclassified to state what was previously reported as an extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment of million net of taxes 
to make this reclassification  interest expense for has been increased by million and the income tax provision was decreased by million 
interest income 
interest income was million for compared to million for the decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the reduced amount of cash invested as we used the cash proceeds from our offering for the prenate  furadantin  and sular acquisitions 
most of the cash proceeds from our offering were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility obtained to finance the sular acquisition in provision for income taxes 
income taxes were provided for at a rate of for and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from working capital requirements  product development activities  funding of acquisitions and debt service 
we have met these cash requirements through cash from operations  borrowings for product acquisitions and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this primarily resulted from the net loss for the year plus decreases in accrued expenses and accounts payable plus an increase in taxes receivable  partially offset by non cash expenses  decreases in inventories  accounts receivable  samples  other prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in our deferred income tax benefit 
also  in our tax liability was reduced by million due to the exercise of non qualified stock options by employees 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund these working capital requirements  at least for the next twelve months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities  or both 
our purchase of inventory impacts our liquidity 
during  we expect to invest cash in the purchase of inventory 
some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements and we believe we will adhere to those requirements in we expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable as our sales increase 
recent regulatory developments affecting our tanafed line could affect our liquidity requirements 
in late  the fda issued a notice about various cough and cold combination products  which we believe requires us to obtain fda approval of our tanafed products before january  in order to be able to thereafter continue to market and sell these products as prescription products 
in october  the fda issued a draft guidance document to address their current approach to handling compliance issues for drugs marketed without fda approval 
we are performing early phase clinical trials that are required for fda approval regardless of the eventual prescription versus over the counter status 
based on the findings of this phase trial  we will finalize our development strategy and seek a pre ind meeting with the fda 
we have not yet determined the estimated cost to obtain fda approval 
we may incur significant developmental expenses to obtain fda approval or may begin marketing tanafed products as non prescription products  which could have a material adverse effect on net revenues and profit margins for the tanafed product line 
we also have other development projects underway including line extensions for our currently marketed products 
these expenses are discretionary and will be funded by existing cash and cash generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the purchase of marketable securities 
in addition  we purchased million of property and equipment in our business strategy includes the acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products that we believe represent attractive growth opportunities for us in the future 
while we are not currently a party to any such agreements  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
subject to our liquidity and capital resources at any particular time  we may incur commitments in the future to acquire or license pharmaceutical products 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  we repurchased million worth of our common stock under our share repurchase program 
we also incurred million of capitalized financing costs in association with our million revolving credit facility 
these uses of cash were offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million 
these shares were issued primarily as a result of option exercises 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement for a million senior secured revolving credit facility with various lenders and lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent 
subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing base requirements  we may from time to time borrow monies under the revolving facility for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets 
borrowings bear interest at our option at the base rate in effect from time to time plus an applicable margin or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin will vary dependent upon our leverage ratio in effect from time to time 
as of february   we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
the revolving facility matures on february  fees payable under the revolving facility include a one time commitment fee of of the stated amount of the facility  an unused commitment fee based on funds committed but not borrowed under the revolving facility at rates which vary dependent upon our leverage ratio in effect from time to time and letter of credit fees equal to per annum of the face amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility may be prepaid from time to time or terminated at our discretion without penalty 
the revolving loan contains various restrictive covenants  including covenants relative to maintaining financial ratios and earnings levels  limitations on acquisitions  dispositions  mergers and capital expenditures  limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and a prohibition on payment of dividends and certain issuances of our capital stock 
as of march  and june   we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of the credit agreement 
effective august   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement and obtained a waiver for the covenant violations and extended the maturity date of the facility to august  contractual obligations payment due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations    purchase obligations     other contractual obligations   total      inventory purchase obligations are based on the unit contractual obligations at the unit cost as of december  unit prices are subject to increase upon notification by the supplier in the event of increased costs incurred by the supplier 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have generally passed these price increases along to our customers 
seasonality although our business is generally non seasonal  sales of certain products  such as cough and cold products  increase between october and march due to the cold and flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded on our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment 
our policy is to estimate bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review when needed 
if we over or under estimate the level of accounts receivable that will not be paid  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
sales deductions 
we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales deductions  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
our return policy conforms to industry standard practices 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
liabilities assumed with the acquisition of product rights 
in connection with the acquisition of product rights  we assume certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimate the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and include that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we review the estimated liability on an annual basis 
if we over or under estimate liabilities assumed  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the aggregate purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets that we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
in assessing the recoverability of its intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include but are not limited to  lack of promotional sensitivity  the introduction of competitive products and changes in government regulations 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
if we should incur an impairment loss  there may be a material impact to the financial statements 
on march   we acquired certain us rights relating to sular for an aggregate purchase price of million 
with the assistance of valuation experts  we allocated the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets which we acquired as part of such transaction 
in addition  we assigned useful lives to those intangible assets acquired which are not deemed to have an indefinite life 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective useful lives 
the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of sular are being amortized over periods ranging from five to twenty years with a weighted average amortization period of nineteen years 
in light of or experience over the last year in promoting sular  we carefully evaluated the useful lives assigned to the intangible assets acquired in the sular acquisition and whether or not any impairment of any such assets was indicated 
our best estimate is that the useful lives assigned to the sular intangible assets remain appropriate 
our estimate of such useful lives is subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
among these risks and uncertainties is our ability to develop one or more new versions of the product  obtain approval from the fda to market and sell such newly developed product and procure patent protection for that product before the expiration of the last to expire of the existing patents related to sular in sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets states that an impairment loss shall be recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the undiscounted future cash flows of sular as estimated by us over the remaining useful life of the product exceed the carrying amount of the sular asset and therefore the carrying amount is estimated to be recoverable 
however  the amount recorded as intangible assets on first horizon s balance sheet for the sular assets may be more or less than the fair value of such assets 
determining the fair value of the sular intangible asset is inherently uncertain  and may be dependent in significant part on the success of our revised plans to promote sular 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
inventory obsolescence 
our products have shelf lives ranging from to months 
we must estimate the amount of inventory recorded on our balance sheet that will not be sold prior to expiration 
this estimate requires analysis of forecasted demand for our products  our promotional focus  amounts of our products currently held by our customers and the impact on our products of competing products 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure retirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other 
fin elaborates on disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued

the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in fin no 
are effective for all financial statements of periods ending after december  for the year ended december   first horizon was not a guarantor on any debt instruments and had no debt outstanding at the end of the period

to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  first horizon did not adopt the fair value method of valuing stock options  however  the adoption of the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the first horizon s financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 

fin no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises where equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
the underlying principle behind fin no 
is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an entity  which is defined in fin no 
as a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
in december  the fasb issued revised fin no 
to clarify certain aspects of fin no 
including the determination of who is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
the revised fin no 
postponed the effective date as to when companies are required to apply the provisions of fin no 
prospectively for all variable interest entities in existence prior to january  until the first financial reporting period that ends after march  however  for entities that are considered to be special purpose entities  the effective date of fin no 
is financial reporting periods after december  the adoption of the provisions of fin no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas in particular  this statement clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component that warrants special reporting in the statement of cash flows 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and its adoption did not have a material impact on first horizon s financial condition or results of operations

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  as a result of concerns over implementation and measurement issues  the fasb unanimously decided on october  to defer the application of sfas no 
to certain non controlling interests of limited life entities that are consolidated in the financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on first horizon s financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of nitrolingual under our agreement with pohl boskamp and our purchases of sular product inventory from bayer are made in euros 
we may eliminate risks from foreign currency fluctuations after the time of shipment of product by entering into forward contracts for these purchases of inventory at the time of product shipments 
in addition  sales of cognex in europe are recognized in euros 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured revolving credit facility arranged by lasalle bank  na  we could experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are outstanding 
as of february  there was no debt outstanding under this facility
