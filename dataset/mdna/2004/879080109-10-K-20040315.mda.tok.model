item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for an overview of operations and trends within the industry 
within our commercial industrial division we lease land to various types of tenants 
we currently lease land to a full service truck stop facility  a truck wash  four auto service stations with convenience stores  four fast food operations  two motels  two antique shops  and a united states postal service facility 
we are also involved in a joint venture that owns and operates a acre travel and truck stop facility  called petro travel plaza 
petro travel plaza also operates two separate gas stations with convenience stores within tejon industrial complex west 
in addition  several microwave repeater locations  radio and cellular transmitter sites  and fiber optic cable routes are also leased 
we also lease 
table of contents acres to calpine for an electric power plant and own and lease three buildings in phoenix  arizona and one office building in rancho santa fe  california 
we lease certain portions of our land to oil companies for the exploration and production of oil and gas  but do not ourselves engage in any such exploratory or extractive activities 
as of december   approximately  acres were committed to producing oil and gas leases from which the operators produced and sold approximately  barrels of oil and  mcf of dry gas during our share of production  based upon prevailing average royalty rates during the last three years  has been   and barrels of oil per day for   and  respectively 
approximately producing oil wells were located on the leased land as of december  estimates of oil and gas reserves on our properties are unknown to us 
we do not make such estimates  and our lessees do not make information concerning reserves available to us 
we have approximately  acres under lease to national cement company of california  inc  which we call national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
national owns and operates on the property a cement manufacturing plant with a capacity of approximately  tons of cement per year 
the amount of payment that we receive under the lease is based upon shipments from the cement plant 
the term of this lease expires in  but national has options to extend the term for successive periods of and years 
proceedings under environmental laws relating to the cement plant are in process  see item  legal proceedings 
our resort residential development activities include conceptual design planning and entitlement activities related to our lands 
during the third quarter of  we announced that our agreement with pardee homes  lewis investment company  and standard pacific corp 
was amended to reflect a larger master planned community development  the centennial development 
the original agreement  previously announced in march  called for a  acre housing development 
the agreement was amended to accommodate a master planned community that encompasses  acres 
the initial plans for this development were filed in los angeles county on august  we are estimating that it could take several years to receive approvals from los angeles county to begin development of this project 
upon completion of the centennial development it is estimated that the community will include approximately  homes 
the community will also incorporate business districts  schools  retail and entertainment centers  medical facilities and other commercial office and light industrial businesses that  when completed  would create a substantial number of jobs 
in addition to the centennial community project  we are engaged in the constraints and feasibility analysis and entitlement work for the tmv community 
tmv is envisioned as an exclusive  resort based community that will provide owners and guests with a wide variety of recreational opportunities  lodging and spa facilities  world class golf facilities  a range of housing options  educational and cultural programs  themed retail shopping  concierge services  and other exclusive services and amenities that are designed to distinguish tmv as the resort of choice for the southern california market 
the sale and leasing of commercial industrial and residential real estate is very competitive  with competition coming from numerous and varied sources around california 
the degree of competition is impacted by such factors as the supply of real estate available for sale or lease that is comparable to 
table of contents our property and the level of demand 
currently  our greatest competition for commercial industrial development comes from land in the inland empire region of southern california and areas north of us in the san joaquin valley of california 
the greatest competition for the centennial project will come from developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tejon mountain village will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
farming operations in the san joaquin valley  we farm permanent crops including the following acreage wine grapes  almonds  pistachios  and walnuts included in these acreage figures are acres of almonds that are currently being developed 
we also grow wheat on approximately acres and alfalfa on acres 
we sell our farm commodities to several commercial buyers 
as a producer of these commodities  we are in direct competition with other producers within the united states and throughout the world 
prices received by us for our commodities are determined by total industry production and demand levels 
we attempt to improve price margins by producing high quality crops through cultural practices and by obtaining better prices through marketing arrangements with handlers 
in  our almonds were primarily sold to various commercial buyers  with one of the buyers receiving approximately of the crop 
since we now process our own almonds  we have considerably more flexibility over the timing and nature of our sales 
we do not believe that we would be adversely affected by the loss of our largest buyers because of the size of the almond market  the large number of other buyers that would be available to us  and the fact that the prices for these commodities do not vary based on the identity of the buyer 
in  the majority of our pistachios were sold to one customer and our walnuts were sold to two customers  each purchasing approximately of the crop 
we believe that the loss of any of these customers would not adversely impact us because  like almonds  there are a number of potential purchasers of pistachios and walnuts and prices do not change based on the identity of the buyer 
during  the majority of harvested wine grapes were sold to two wineries 
we continue to believe that there is an imbalance between the supply and demand of wine grapes as a result of so many new plantings coming into production within california 
this imbalance in grapes does appear to be improving  so we continue to expect low grape prices over the next few years 
nut and grape crop markets are particularly sensitive to the size of each year s world crop and the demand for those crops 
large crops in california and abroad can rapidly depress prices 
our water entitlement for available from the state water project was adequate for our farming needs 
the state department of water resources has announced its water supply at of full entitlement 
other water supplies that the local water district will be able to make available to its farmers  combined with this level of state entitlement  are expected to provide a level of water supply that will cover all of our farming needs 
if in any year the local water district cannot meet all of our agricultural demands  we will rely on ground water sources  water transfers from the tejon castac water district and water banking arrangements that we have entered into 
water from these sources 
table of contents may be more expensive because of pumping costs and transfer costs  but can be expected to make up for shortfalls of the kind we have experienced in the past

table of contents item properties our  acres include portions of the san joaquin valley  portions of the tehachapi mountains and portions of the western end of the antelope valley 
a number of key transportation and utility facilities cross our land  including interstate  california highways  and  the california aqueduct which brings water from northern california  and various transmission lines for electricity  oil  natural gas and communication systems 
approximately  acres of our land are located in kern county  california 
the kern county general plan for this land contemplates continued commercial  resource utilization  farming  grazing and other agricultural uses  as well as certain new developments and uses  including residential and recreational facilities 
while the county general plan is intended to provide general guidelines for land use and development  it is subject to amendment to accommodate changing circumstances and needs 
in addition to conforming to the general plan  much of our land will require specific zoning and site plan approvals prior to actual development 
the remainder of our land  approximately  acres  is in los angeles county 
this area is accessible from interstate via highway los angeles county has adopted general plan policies which contemplate future residential development of portions of this land  subject to further assessments of environmental and infrastructure constraints 
we are currently pursuing entitlements for a master planned community on  acres of this land 
see item  business real estate operations 
portions of our land consist of mountainous terrain and much of the land is not presently served by developed roads or by utility or water lines 
any significant development of the land would involve the construction of roads  utilities and other expensive infrastructure and would have to be done in a manner that accommodates a number of environmental concerns  including endangered species and wetlands issues  that may limit development of portions of the land or result in substantial delays in getting governmental approval 
water rights existing long term water contracts with the wheeler ridge maricopa water storage district  which we call the wheeler ridge water district  provide for water entitlements and deliveries from the california state water project to our agricultural operations in the san joaquin valley 
the terms of these contracts extend to under the contracts  we are entitled to annual water for  acres of land  which is adequate for our present farming operations 
in addition to our agricultural contract water entitlements  we have an additional entitlement to obtain from the california state water project sufficient water to service a substantial amount of future residential and or commercial development in kern county 
the tejon castac water district  a local water district serving only our land and land we have sold in the tejon industrial complex  has  acre feet of state water project entitlement  or enough to supply over  average families assuming delivery 
in addition  tejon castac has over  acre feet of water stored in kern county water banks 
both the entitlement and the banked water are the subject of a long term water supply contract extending to between tejon castac and our company 
tejon castac is the principal 
table of contents water supplier to the tejon industrial complex  and would be the principal water supplier for any significant residential and recreational development in tejon mountain village 
during project allocations were only  but the wheeler ridge water district was able to supply us with of our farming demands 
in some years  there is also sufficient runoff from local mountain streams to allow us to capture some of this water in reservoirs and utilize it to offset some of the higher priced state water project water 
both the wheeler ridge water district and tejon castac are able to bank percolate into underground aquifers some of their excess supplies for future use 
the wheeler ridge water district expects to be able to deliver our entire contract water entitlement in any year that the state water project deliveries exceed by drawing on its ground water wells and water banking assets 
based on historical records of water availability  we do not believe we have material problems with our water supply 
however  if state water project deliveries are less than of our entitlement in any year  or if less severe shortages continue for a sustained period of several years  then the wheeler ridge water district may not be able to deliver of our entitlement and we will have to rely on our own ground water sources  mountain stream runoff  water transfers from the tejon castac water district and water banking assets to supply the shortfalls to our farming operations 
water from these sources may be more expensive because of pumping costs and or transfer costs 
also  as we develop our real estate for residential  commercial and industrial uses  there will be less water available for agriculture from the tejon castac water district 
a allocation has been made by the state water project for with this allocation  along with the wheeler ridge water district s additional supplies  we believe that we will have adequate water supplies for farming in the water contracts with the wheeler ridge water district and with tejon castac require annual payments related to the fixed costs of the california state water project and each district  whether or not water is used or available 
the contracts also establish a lien on benefited land 
the water agency serving the los angeles county portion of our land  the antelope valley east kern water agency  has significant surplus entitlement and  although no assurance has been given  it has indicated that it would be able to provide a significant portion of the water needed for centennial 
portions of our property also have available groundwater 
that source would be sufficient to supply significant commercial development in the interstate corridor and provide a significant portion of the water needed for development at centennial and tejon mountain village 
historic state water project restrictions on the right to use agricultural water entitlement for municipal purposes were removed in  and the parties to a lawsuit challenging such removal have agreed to a settlement which would allow such removal to continue while the environmental impacts are studied 
for this purpose  municipal use includes residential and industrial use 
therefore  although only  of tejon castac s  acre feet of entitlement are labeled for municipal use  there is no practical restriction on tejon castac s ability to deliver the remaining water to residential or industrial developments 
however  for political and regulatory reasons  it is unlikely that we would be able to direct any of our wheeler ridge water district agricultural entitlement to municipal or industrial uses 

table of contents item legal proceedings we lease land to national cement company of california  inc  or national  for the purpose of manufacturing portland cement from limestone deposits found on the leased acreage 
see item  business real estate operations 
national s former subtenant  systech environmental corporation is performing studies for the california department of toxic substances control in order to achieve regulatory closure for its former facility that burned hazardous waste as a supplemental fuel in the cement plant located on land leased from us 
the california regional water quality control board  or rwqcb  for the lahontan region has issued several orders with respect to four environmental conditions on the property groundwater plume of chlorinated hydrocarbon compounds 
this order directs our former tenant  lafarge corporation  or lafarge  and our current tenant national  and us to  among other things  investigate the source and extent of the contamination and initiate cleanup 
we are advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation  and are operating a groundwater pump and treat system to clean up the groundwater 
in and  lafarge and national removed certain soils  which were the principal source of the contamination  from the property 
cement kiln dust 
national and lafarge have consolidated  closed and capped cement kiln dust piles located on land leased from us 
an order of rwqcb directs national  lafarge  and us to maintain and monitor the effectiveness of the cap 
maintenance of the cap and groundwater monitoring remain as on going activities 
former industrial waste landfill 
this order requires lafarge  national  and us to complete the cleanup of groundwater associated with the landfill 
we are advised that lafarge is addressing the low level contamination by natural attenuation and that monitoring remains as an ongoing activity 
lafarge previously removed waste historically disposed of in the landfill and transported that waste off site for disposal 
diesel fuel 
an order of the rwqcb directs lafarge  national  and us to investigate and clean up contamination from a diesel fuel tank and pipeline 
we are advised that lafarge and national have completed their investigation and groundwater cleanup and that groundwater monitoring remains as an on going activity 
some minor oil contamination located beneath plant buildings and equipment remains on the property 
to date  we are not aware of any failure by lafarge or national to comply with the orders or other informal requests of the rwqcb 
we have not been directed by rwqcb to perform any remedial activities 
under our lease with national  national is obligated to indemnify us for costs and liabilities arising directly or indirectly out of its use of the leased premises 
lafarge has liability for all obligations under the indemnity provisions arising before the november assignment of the lease to national 
we believe that all of the matters described above in this item are included within the scope of the national or lafarge indemnity obligations 
the company believes that lafarge and national have sufficient resources to perform any reasonably possible or reasonably likely obligations relating to these matters 
if they do not and we are required to 
table of contents perform the likely remedial work at our own cost  it is unlikely that the amount of any such expenditure by us would be material 
on february   the center for biological diversity and other environmental groups filed a lawsuit in kern county superior court against kern county 
this suit challenges the county s certification of the environmental impact report  or eir  for tejon industrial complex east  or tic east  the company s  acre expansion of the industrial park at the south end of the san joaquin valley 
principal environmental issues raised in the suit involve the project s likely effects on air quality and endangered species  the impact of converting farmland to development and the related potential for growth inducement  and the cumulative impact of the project when combined with other development on company land and elsewhere 
the suit also challenges the land use entitlements granted by the county as being inconsistent with the county s general plan and zoning policies 
two subsidiaries of the company are the real parties in interest 
the company has an obligation to indemnify and defend the county and has undertaken defense of this suit in close coordination with county counsel 
on october   the kern county superior court issued a ruling in this case  voiding the county s certification of the eir based on two grounds 
first  the court found that there was not sufficient evidence that the eir adequately described the impacts that tic east would have on the air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin 
the principal reason for this conclusion is that certain data and guidance provided by local air quality districts  which was cited  discussed and relied upon in the eir  could not be used to support the county s decision because it was not physically included in the administrative record 
second  two species of concern ie species not listed under the state and federal endangered species acts but which are for other reasons required to be discussed in eirs if they could be affected by a development found on or near the project site were not specifically discussed in the eir  due to a mistake by the consulting biologists 
the court found that the eir was adequate in all other aspects and ruled in favor of the company on separate claims asserted by plaintiffs under the laws governing planning and zoning in california 
the court did not void the land use entitlements approved by the county 
the court retained jurisdiction over the case until the county certifies an amended eir and administrative record correcting the deficiencies identified by the court 
the land use entitlements cannot be used to support real estate developments until the eir is corrected and recertified by the county and returned to the court for its review 
we estimate that it will take several months to gather data and correct the eir and record as directed by the court and several additional months for the county to process the corrected eir 
it is expected that plaintiffs will contest the adequacy of the corrected eir before both the county board of supervisors and the court  which would result in further delays before the company can use the land use entitlements to develop the land

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview see part i  item  business for cautionary statement regarding forward looking information 
we are currently working to take advantage of existing resources and market conditions as well as to anticipate future market trends and create demand 
part of this effort includes evaluating our land and water resources and planning our real estate development activities based upon the evaluation 
in the future  we will continue to assess the feasibility of entering into complementary lines of business and refining or reconfiguring current core businesses to take advantage of opportunities presented and changing market conditions 
as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we have a net loss of  in  net income of  in  and net income of  in when compared to  the loss in is due to a decline in real estate operating profits  a loss from operations in our farming segment  and a reduction in interest income 
net income for declined when compared to due to lower real estate operating profits  reduced interest income  higher corporate expenses  and losses from discontinued operations 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by improved profits from farming and equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  capitalization of costs  profit recognition related to land sales  and defined benefit retirement plans 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is primarily derived from rental revenue from our rental portfolio  royalty revenue from mineral leases  sales of farm crops  and land sales 
revenue from leases with rent concessions or fixed escalations is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial term of the related lease 
the financial terms of leases are contractually defined 
rental revenue is not accrued when a tenant vacates the premises and ceases to make rent payments or files for bankruptcy 
revenues related to our agreements with calpine are recognized when payable under the terms of the 
table of contents lease due to construction and the uncertainty related to the timing of completion of the power plant and the beginning of plant operations 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to record these sales 
sfas no 
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas no 
requires a land sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold 
at the time farm crops are harvested  contracted  and delivered to buyers and revenues can be estimated  revenues and any related inventory costs are recognized  which traditionally occurs during the third and fourth quarters of each year 
orchard almonds  pistachios  and walnuts revenues are based upon the contract settlement price or estimated selling price  whereas vineyard revenues are recognized at the contracted selling price 
estimated prices for orchard crops are based upon the quoted estimate of what the final market price will be by marketers and handlers of the orchard crops 
this method of recognizing revenues on the sale of orchard crops is a standard practice within the agribusiness community 
for the orchard crops  we estimated almond revenues to be  or per pound on average  pistachio revenue to be  or per pound  and walnut revenue to be  or 
per pound 
these estimates not only impact the recorded revenues within our farming segment but also our recorded accounts receivable at december  over the last three years  prices received on almonds have ranged from to per pound 
pistachio prices over the last three years have ranged from to per pound  and walnut prices have ranged from 
to 
per pound 
if we were to assume that our above estimates for orchard crop revenues were changed to the upper end or lower end of the range we developed in the course of formulating our estimate  orchard crop revenues would have been reduced or increased by approximately  or of the total revenue estimate 
our final estimates were based on the midpoint of a range in which the upper and lower ends of the range were 
from the midpoint 
as an example  the range for almonds in was to per pound 
actual final orchard crop selling prices are not determined for several months following the close of our fiscal year due to supply and demand fluctuations within the orchard crop markets 
adjustments for differences between original estimates and actual revenues received are recorded during the period in which such amounts become known 
the net effect of these adjustments increased farming revenue  in and  in and decreased farming revenue  in the large adjustment in related to crops was due to a continuing increase in almond prices prior to our final scheduled payments being received 
if we were to change our estimate of orchard crop revenues to the low end of the estimate range  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 

table of contents capitalization of cost the company capitalizes direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance  and indirect project costs that are clearly associated with the acquisition  development  or construction of a project 
costs currently capitalized that in the future would be related to any abandoned development opportunities will be written off if we determine such costs do not provide any future benefits 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  and insurance costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
allocation of costs related to land sales and leases when we sell or lease land within one of our real estate developments and we have not completed all infrastructure development related to the total project  we follow sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  to determine the appropriate costs of sales for the sold land and the timing of recognition of the sale 
in the calculation of cost of sales or allocations to leased land we use estimates and forecasts to determine total costs at completion of the development project 
these estimates of final development costs can change as conditions in the market change and costs of construction change 
in preparing these estimates we use internal budgets  forecasts  and engineering reports to help us estimate future costs related to infrastructure that has not been completed 
these estimates become more accurate as the development proceeds forward due to historical cost numbers and to the continued refinement of the development plan 
these estimates are updated periodically throughout the year so that  at the ultimate completion of development  all costs have been allocated 
during  
per square foot of cost was allocated to sold and leased land as a cost of development 
any increases to this estimate in future years will negatively impact net profits and liquidity due to an increased need for funds to complete development 
if  however  this estimate decreases  net profits as well as liquidity will improve 
we believe that the estimates used related to cost of sales and allocations to leased land is a critical accounting estimate and will be more significant as we grow as a real estate development company because the estimates are very susceptible to change from period to period  due to the fact that they require management to make assumptions about costs of construction  absorption of product  and timing of project completion and changes to these estimates could have a material impact on the recognition of profits from the sale of land within our developments 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our property and equipment and development projects for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized 
the amount of the impairment is determined by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
we currently operate in two segments  real estate and farming 
at this time  there are no assets within our real estate or farming segments that we believe are in danger of being impaired due to market conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is very susceptible to change from period to period  it requires management to make 
table of contents assumptions about future prices  production  and costs  and the potential impact of a loss from impairment could be material to our earnings 
management s assumptions regarding future cash flows from real estate developments and farming operations have fluctuated in the past due to changes in prices  absorption  production and costs and are expected to continue to do so in the future as market conditions change 
in estimating future prices  absorption  production  and costs  we use our internal forecasts and business plans 
we develop our forecasts based on recent sales data  historical absorption and production data  as well as discussions with commercial real estate brokers and potential purchasers of our farming products 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at december   the weighted average actuarial assumption of the company s domestic plans consisted of a discount rate of  a long term rate of return on plan assets of  and assumed salary increases of 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this management discussion and analysis 
new accounting pronouncements the accounting policies adopted during were related to new accounting pronouncements and the adoption of these policies did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november the initial recognition and measurement requirements of the interpretation are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  under the requirements a guarantee would have to be recorded as a liability equal to the expected present value of the estimated probability weighted range of contingent payments under the guarantee arrangement

when this happens  we create revenues through the sale of an easement  as we did in these opportunities do not happen each year and it is impossible to accurately predict when the next easement sale opportunity will arise 
the decline in revenue from the power plant lease during was due to the timing of the plant becoming operational 
the power plant lease allows for a twelve month grace period that began in july  per month in the event construction is not completed and the plant is not operational 
whether or not the plant is operational  contractual payments are scheduled to resume in july at this time it is anticipated that the plant will become operational during the summer in expenses are higher in due to the continuing increase in activities related to our land development and entitlement activities 
consulting costs and public relations expenses related to development activities increased  during insurance costs increased  in due to the continuing increase in costs related to liability and property insurance and also to higher insurable values within the tic development 
property taxes increased  due primarily to higher assessed values and to special taxes related to a community facilities district 
expenses also increased  during due to costs associated with farming fallow ground within the tic east development as we continue to work on securing entitlements for development of that project 
during we also capitalized  less in costs related to salaries and indirect costs due to time 
table of contents being shifted to real estate activities not directly related to the current active projects 
the above unfavorable variances were partially offset by the continuing growth of lease revenues  increased oil and mineral revenues and higher service and amenity revenues 
lease revenue improved  during due to new leases in and to a full year s lease revenue related to new leases 
oil and mineral revenues grew  in due to a continued increase in oil and cement plant production 
service and amenity revenues increased  due to the growth of hunting lease revenues and property management revenues 
during we recognized a loss in unconsolidated joint ventures of  this loss is primarily due to a loss within the tejon dermody joint venture of  due to the loss of a tenant in our building and the write off of the unamortized lease costs related to the tenant that left 
the tenant in the joint venture building filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during early may the lease was terminated and the building became vacant during september due to this vacancy  revenues in the tejon dermody joint venture will be significantly impacted 
given current market conditions  it could take several months before the building is released 
in addition  the centennial joint venture lost  related to a farming project within the centennial planning area 
offsetting these losses was an increase in profit at the petro joint venture 
during we recognized  in profits from the operations of the petro travel plaza joint venture 
this improvement over the prior year is due to a continuing increase in volume of transactions and to improved margins on diesel sales 
near term activities within the real estate segment will be focused on the development of commercial industrial products  obtaining entitlements for the centennial project in los angeles county  and the filing for entitlements for tejon mountain village 
the sales  leasing  and marketing of tejon industrial complex has been slowed by the downturn in activity related to distribution and manufacturing facilities 
during  this market segment was very slow due to economic conditions during the year as well as a general resistance by firms to commit to any expansion at this time 
thus far in we have begun to see an increase in inquiries regarding our site as a potential location for distribution facilities 
we believe that as california s population continues to grow and the economy improves  we will begin to see an increase in industrial activity at tejon industrial complex 
our development fits very well within the new logistics model that companies are beginning to use that favors larger single site buildings rather than a number of decentralized smaller distribution centers 
buildings of million square feet or larger are difficult to build in los angeles due to the number of acres necessary for a building of that size 
we believe that our ability to provide land parcels to support buildings of that size will provide us with a potential marketing advantage 
helping to offset the slowness in industrial development was continued growth and activity within the commercial retail segment of the market 
two new tenants opened for business in tic west in  panda express and a second mobil gas and convenience store 
based on the continuing growth of traffic on interstate and the success of current retail tenants  we believe that the retail component of our development will continue to grow into the future 
the real estate segment will continue to experience increases in costs  net of amounts capitalized  primarily related to professional service fees  marketing costs  commissions  planning costs  and staffing costs as we continue to increase real estate activities and pursue development opportunities 
the actual timing and completion of entitlement and development related activities is difficult to predict due to the uncertainties of the approval process and market factors 
these types of real estate development activities and costs could continue over several years as we develop our land holdings 

table of contents we will also continue to evaluate land resources to determine the highest and best uses for our land holdings 
future sales of land are dependent on market circumstances and specific opportunities 
our goal in the future is to increase land value and create future revenue growth through planning and development of commercial  industrial  resort and residential programs 
segment operating profits within real estate during were  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decline in segment profits during was due primarily to an increase in segment expenses and reduced revenues associated with the power plant lease 
revenues from the power plant agreement declined approximately  during due to the earning of milestone payments in related to easements and use of our land 
expenses increased due to the continued expansion of our real estate activities 
marketing and transaction costs related to our development projects increased  during property management costs  which included costs related to leased property and expenses associated with the management of the ranch  had a net increase of  during staff costs increased  during due to the timing of hiring staff during  and insurance costs allocated to real estate increased  due to a hardening of general liability and property insurance markets over the last two years 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by increases in lease revenues  oil and mineral royalties  easement sales  and land sales 
lease revenues increased  due to three new leases coming on line during and to a full year of grazing lease revenue 
oil and mineral royalties grew  when compared to due to higher oil prices and increased production related to the cement plant lease 
during  we also received a  easement payment related to a natural gas pipeline that crosses our land and we sold approximately acres of land  recognizing a gain of approximately equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures increased  during due primarily to continued improvements in operations at petro travel plaza 
results of operations at the petro travel plaza joint venture increased  compared to the prior year due to an increase in volume of activity and improved margins on gasoline and diesel sales 
these joint venture profits were partially offset by a loss of  within the tejon dermody joint venture 
this loss was the result of depreciation and interest expense for the entire development  and costs early in associated with leasing one half of the building within the venture being greater than the revenue generated from leasing one half of the building 
see part i  item business real estate operations for a further discussion of real estate development activities 
farming 
during  the farming segment sustained a loss of  a decrease of  when compared to segment profits 
the decline during is due to a decrease in pistachio revenues of  reduced revenue from the almond processing plant of  and reduced rental revenues of  also contributing to the decline in segment profits was an increase in cultural costs of  higher insurance costs of  and increased costs at the almond processing plant of  these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in almond revenues of  an improvement in grape revenue of  lower staffing costs of  and reduced water costs of  pistachio revenue declined due to a significant drop in production during pistachios are an alternate bearing crop with one year having high production followed by a lower production year 

table of contents production fell in from the record high production of due to the alternate bearing nature of the crop and to poor weather during the early part of the crop s growing season 
offsetting some of the loss in production in are higher prices for our pistachios 
the price we are receiving in is per pound  compared to per pound in the increase in price is driven by lower statewide production within california 
almond revenues increased during due to a large increase in prices for our almonds  and to the receipt of  related to higher final prices related to the crop 
the average price we are receiving for our almonds in is per pound  as compared to a per pound in the prior year 
prices each year are driven by production and demand for the crop 
our production for  as well as the statewide production  declined when compared to the prior year primarily due to poor weather during the bloom cycle for the trees 
this decline in production  along with the continuing demand for almonds  led to the increase in pricing we are now seeing 
the improvement in grape revenues during is primarily related to an improvement in the prices we received for our crop 
revenues declined at our almond processing plant due primarily to the timing of sale of almond hulls 
costs at the almond plant increased in due to the processing of the almond crop during because of an increase in the number of pounds processed at the plant in all of our crops are sensitive to the size of each year s world crop 
large crops in california and abroad can depress prices 
with lower statewide grape production  the current pressure on prices due to an oversupply of grapes could begin to be alleviated over the next couple of years 
almond production is also down across the state during due to heavy rains during the bloom cycle 
a positive factor for the almond industry is that demand for product has remained very strong both in the united states and in export markets  and  with a smaller crop than last year s record statewide crop  prices for almonds have begun to rise 
our long term projection is that crop production  especially of almonds and pistachios  will increase on a statewide basis over time because of new plantings  which could negatively impact future prices if the growth in demand does not continue to keep pace with production 
the potential increase in almond production will positively impact our almond processing operation because of more almonds being available to process 
farming segment profits of  in increased  when compared to a loss of  in the improvement in segment profits was due to an increase in almond revenues of  higher pistachio revenues of  improved walnut revenues of  and an increase in revenues of  at our almond processing plant 
these increases in revenues were partially offset by increased cultural costs and by higher operating costs at pacific almond  our almond processing plant 
cultural costs increased  due to higher harvesting costs and pest control costs 
net operating costs at pacific almond grew  due primarily to additional staffing and supply costs related to an increase in the number of almonds processed at the plant 
partially offsetting these increases in cost was a reduction in fixed water costs of  almond revenues increased during due primarily to higher production when compared to the prior year 
the increase in production was due to excellent weather during the bloom period for almonds and to acres of almonds producing their first full crop 
almond prices for were also slightly higher than the prior year due to stronger demand for the product 
included within the increase in almond revenues is approximately  of earnings related to the receipt of crop insurance proceeds related to the crop 

table of contents pistachio revenues were higher in due to a continuing improvement in production and to improved prices when compared to production increased due to excellent weather during the growing season and to production being higher than expected from our young pistachio orchard 
pistachios are generally an alternate bearing crop  meaning that a year of low production follows a year of high production 
the improvement in walnut revenue was due to improved production  better pricing  and the receipt of  of crop insurance proceeds related to the crop 
for a further discussion of the farming operations  refer to part i  item i  business farming operations 
interest 
interest and investment income of  fell  during  due primarily to lower interest rates on funds invested and to fewer funds being invested 
for liquidity management purposes  a large portion of the funds invested were invested into securities with very short maturity dates and therefore the interest earned was much less than the prior year 
interest and investment income during fell approximately  due to fewer funds being invested and to lower interest rates on funds invested 
the decline in funds invested was due to the liquidation of debt in and to expenditures on property and equipment that reduced cash available for investment in interest expense for is  compared to interest expense of  in  of which  was included in discontinued operations 
interest expense declined slightly  due primarily to lower average rates on credit line debt outstanding 
interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
interest expense for was  of which  is included in discontinued operations  compared to interest expense of  in  of which  is included in discontinued operations 
interest expense declined due to lower average outstanding amounts on credit lines and the capitalization of interest expense due to the growth of our real estate development activities 
interest incurred and paid in was  compared to  in  of which  and  were capitalized  respectively 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses in are  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
corporate expenses increased due to higher staffing and benefit costs  higher professional service fees  increased maintenance costs  and to higher depreciation expense 
these cost increases were partially offset by reduced charitable contributions  and to an increase in general and administrative allocations to operating divisions 
staffing and benefit costs increased primarily because of higher expenses associated with our defined benefit plan 
corporate expenses during were  an increase of  when compared to corporate expenses 
the increase was due to higher staffing and benefit costs  increased professional service fees  higher community and charitable donations  and an increase in insurance costs 

table of contents discontinued operations 
during april  the company finalized its plan for the sale of its cattle and feedlot division 
since then  we have disposed of our cattle and feedlot operations  which provided capital for real estate development activities and helped to reduce outstanding debt 
while the sale of livestock assets provided significant working capital  it also resulted in a loss of significant revenues  even after taking into account the revenue stream from grazing leases that we have entered into in connection with the sales of the breeding herd 
during april  we completed the process of liquidating the remaining stocker cattle herd 
there were no discontinued operation assets at december  or at december  discontinued operations for generated a loss of  or per share diluted 
the loss is due to losses on much of the cattle being sold during the first quarter of because of lower feeder cattle prices 
inflation  risks  and related factors affecting forward looking information 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
our strategy  focused on more aggressive development of our land  involves risk and could result in operating losses 
cyclical industry 
the real estate development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  including employment levels availability of financing interest rates consumer confidence demand for the developed product  whether residential or industrial the process of development of a project begins and financial and other resources are committed long before a real estate project comes to market  which could occur at a time when the real estate market is depressed 
it is also possible in a rural area like ours that no market for the project will develop as projected 
interest rates 
higher interest rates generally impact the real estate industry by making it harder for buyers to qualify for financing  which can lead to a decrease in the demand for residential  commercial or industrial sites 
any decrease in demand will negatively impact our proposed developments 
any downturn in the economy or consumer confidence can also be expected to result in reduced housing demand and slower industrial development  which would negatively impact the demand for land we are developing 
government actions and land use regulations 
in planning and developing our land  we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  and construction 
all of our new developments require amending existing general plan and zoning designations  so it is possible that our entitlement applications could be denied 
in addition  the zoning that ultimately is approved could include density provisions that would limit the number of homes and other structures that could be built within the boundaries of a particular area  which would adversely impact the financial returns from a given project 
the los angeles county planning department recently released a set of draft amendments to the los angeles county general 
table of contents plan which would extend a planning overlay designation called sensitive ecological areas to cover most of the footprint of the centennial project 
it is not clear at this early stage what chance this draft has of being adopted by the county board of supervisors or what its impact on centennial would be  but if adopted it would likely involve additional processing time  studies  and findings by county officials  could have an adverse impact similar to the density provisions described above and  as a worst case  could provide a pretext for denying the centennial application 
in addition  many states  cities and counties including neighboring ventura county have in the past approved various slow growth or urban limit line measures 
if that were to occur in the jurisdictions governing the company s land use  our future real estate development activities could be significantly adversely affected 
a state agency has recently released an environmental document for a proposed billion high speed rail system for california 
there are two routes proposed between los angeles and bakersfield  both of which traverse tejon ranch 
one would run at the northern tip of the ranch  which would not affect any development plans  and one would run along interstate  which would have a significant  adverse affect on two of our projects 
this route would run next to tejon lake  could have significant impacts on the viability of tejon mountain village during the system s construction period  and could possibly impair the ability of this area ultimately to support recreational amenities 
this route also runs through tic east 
the economic effect of these impacts should be largely offset by the significant condemnation award and severance damages that the company should receive for the taking of some of its most valuable land  but the outcome of such condemnation proceedings cannot be assured and the proceedings are likely to be protracted 
a bond measure to fund this rail system is currently set to appear on the november california statewide ballot  but the governor has called for it to be removed from the ballot due to california s current fiscal condition and observers believe that is likely to happen  although its removal cannot not assured 
litigation 
the land use approval processes we must follow to ultimately develop our projects have become increasingly complex 
moreover  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge the proposed plans and approvals 
as a result  the prospect of third party challenges to planned real estate developments provides additional uncertainties in real estate development planning and entitlements 
third party challenges in the form of litigation would  by their nature  adversely affect the length of time and the cost required to obtain the necessary approvals 
in addition  adverse decisions arising from any litigation would increase the costs and length of time to obtain ultimate approval of a project and could adversely affect the design  scope  plans and profitability of a project 
environmental regulation and opposition 
environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site s location and condition  present and former uses of the site  and the presence or absence of sensitive elements like wetlands and endangered species 
environmental laws and conditions may result in delays  cause us to incur additional costs for compliance  mitigation and processing land use applications  or preclude development in specific areas 
in addition  in california third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and wildlife agencies to minimize and 
table of contents mitigate the impacts of its planned projects  certain groups opposed to development have made clear they intend to oppose our projects vigorously  so litigation challenging their approval is expected 
the issues most commonly cited in opponents public comments include the poor air quality of the san joaquin valley air basin  potential impacts of projects on the california condor  presumed removal of oak trees  and the potential for our lands to function as wildlife movement corridors 
in addition  certain military commanders have sent correspondence opposing the centennial project because it would limit their use of low level training flight routes that traverse over tejon ranch 
real estate inventory risk 
our four current and planned real estate projects  the tejon industrial complex west and east  centennial and the tejon mountain village  all involve obtaining governmental entitlements and improving lots for sale to developers or  in the case of tejon industrial complex  end users 
the value of these lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
development competition 
within our real estate activities  we are in direct competition for customers with other industrial sites in northern  central  and southern california 
we are also in competition with other highway interchange locations using interstate and state route for commercial leasing opportunities 
centennial ultimately would compete with other residential housing options in the region  such as developments in the santa clarita valley  lancaster  palmdale  and bakersfield 
tejon mountain village will compete generally for discretionary dollars that consumers will allocate to recreation and second homes  so its competition will range over a greater area and range of projects 
geographic concentration 
all of our developable land is in california 
any adverse change in the economic climate of california  or our region of that state  and any adverse change in the political or regulatory climate of california  could adversely affect our real estate development activities 
ultimately  our ability to sell or lease lots may decline as a result of weak economic conditions  or restrictive regulations 
key personnel 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
we currently depend heavily on the services of robert a 
stine  our president and chief executive officer  and a number of other key management personnel 
the loss of mr 
stine s services or that of other key personnel could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  or our ability to pursue land development 
our success will also depend in part on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel 
competition for such personnel is strong in the real estate and land development industry and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require 
only a limited market exists for tejon ranch common stock which could lead to price volatility 
the limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated  leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock 

table of contents concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden change in our share price 
as of march   directors and members of our executive management team beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
investors who purchase our common stock may be subject to certain risks due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on our farming operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to our farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue  just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
within our real estate operations  our lease portfolio is protected to some extent from inflation  since percentage rent clauses and consumer price index increases in our leases tend to adjust rental receipts for inflation 
other risks 
we may also encounter other difficulties in developing our land  including natural risks  such as geological and soil problems  earthquakes  heavy rains and flooding and heavy winds  shortages of qualified tradespeople  reliance on local contractors  who may be inadequately capitalized  shortages of materials  and increases in the cost of certain materials 
cash flow and liquidity 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of  from the corresponding amount at the end of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities decreased during due primarily to the net loss from operations and land development project costs 
these outflows were partially offset by funds from the exercise of stock options  proceeds from the sale of real estate and an increase in mortgage debt 
cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities increased during due to the liquidation of the remaining discontinued assets  the receipt of bond reimbursement proceeds  proceeds from land sales  and funds from the exercise of stock options 
these increases were partially offset by property and equipment expenditures  land development project costs  and the financing of receivables and inventories 

table of contents the following table summarizes the cash flow activities for the last three years year ended december in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations in  net cash provided by operating activities was  compared to net cash used of  in and cash provided from operating activities of  in during  the net cash provided from operations was the result of the prepayment of grazing leases  and a reduction of accounts receivable that were partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets 
during  a large increase in receivables  due to a large pistachio crop  a reduction in payables and income taxes  and the recognition of the equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures resulted in the use of cash from operations 
cash used in investing activities in was  compared to  and  used in and  respectively 
the increase in over is due primarily to a reduction in proceeds from real estate sales during  and to the receipt in of proceeds from a local community facility district as reimbursement of infrastructure development costs within the tic west development partially offset by a reduction in capital expenditures 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities between and was due to proceeds from the sale of real estate  reimbursement of funds from a local community facilities district and reduced capital expenditures 
capital expenditures were  in  compared to  in and  in capital expenditures for these years were primarily dominated by investment within our real estate projects 
capital investments in our real estate projects are primarily related to infrastructure development and to the capitalization of costs related to various activities in preparation for the filing of entitlements for our real estate projects 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will be approximately  to  these estimated requirements include approximately  of infrastructure and entitlement investment at tic west and east   to  in planning entitlement costs related to the tejon mountain village development  and approximately  of investment within our farm operations to complete the development of an almond orchard and for the replacement of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to  in  and  in the increase in when compared to is due to additional proceeds from the exercise of stock options and to proceeds from a mortgage related to a leased building 
the decline in cash provided by financing activities between and is due primarily to the completion of a stock rights offering in january it is difficult to accurately predict cash flows due to the nature of our businesses and fluctuating economic conditions 
our earnings and cash flows will be affected from period to period by the commodity nature of our farming operations and to the timing of sales and leases of property within our development projects 
the timing of sales and leases within our development projects is difficult to predict due to the time necessary to complete the development process and negotiate sales or lease contracts 
often  this nuance of land development can lead to particular years or periods having more or less earnings than comparable periods 
based on our experience  we believe we will have adequate cash flows and cash balances over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 

table of contents capital structure and financial condition 
management considers our financial structure and condition solid 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of  of debt and  of equity and resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of which is slightly greater than the prior year s debt to total capitalization ratio 
the increase in the ratio during is due largely to the renegotiation of our credit facility with wells fargo that resulted in a portion of the debt being classified as long term rather than short term debt and to the addition of mortgage debt related to a leased facility 
our debt primarily consists of a long term revolving line of credit and mortgages on projects 
we have a long term revolving line of credit of  that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of  this credit facility bears an interest rate that floats with changes in the lending bank s prime interest rate 
at the company s option  the interest rate on this line of credit can be fixed at over a selected libor rate or float at 
less than the bank s prime lending rate 
during the term of this credit facility  we can borrow at any time and partially or wholly repay any outstanding borrowings and then re borrow as necessary 
the outstanding principal balance of this credit facility is due and payable in full on june  the proceeds from this credit facility are being used to fund real estate development infrastructure  real estate entitlement activities  and farming assets on our land 
this note is secured by all of our farm acreage 
the remaining long term debt  less current portion of  is  at december  this remaining debt is being used to fund commercial buildings in phoenix  arizona  our almond processing plant  and a build to suit building 
the note obligation used to purchase the buildings in phoenix is secured by mortgages on the buildings  has a balance of  and is payable in equal monthly installments through april the loan used to purchase the almond processing plant in has a balance of  with the final payment due february  the final note is for a loan that provides long term financing for a building being leased to starbucks 
the current balance of this note is  with a maturity date of may  the remaining long term debt is related to the financing of equipment 
contractual cash obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments over the next five years total one year or less years years after years contractual obligations long term debt cash contract commitments total contractual obligations our cash contract commitments consist of contracts in various stages of completion related to infrastructure development within our industrial developments  entitlement costs related to our industrial and residential development projects  and a company public relations campaign 
these 
table of contents commitments do not include any on going operational costs such as utilities and maintenance contracts for equipment 
at the present time  we do not have any capital lease obligations or purchase obligations outstanding 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for office equipment and average approximately  per month for the next two years 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table shows contingent obligations we have with respect to unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest  and also a local community facilities district 
total one year or less years years other commercial commitments standby letter of credit guarantees total other commerical commitments the standby letter of credit is related to the issuance of community facility district bonds by the tejon ranch public facilities financing authority  a joint powers authority created by kern county and the tejon castac water district 
the standby letter of credit is in place to provide additional credit enhancement and covers approximately two years worth of interest on the outstanding bonds 
this letter of credit will not be drawn upon unless we  as the largest landowner in the district  fail to make our property tax payments 
this letter of credit is for a two year period and will be renewed if necessary in the guarantees consist of a  guarantee related to the debt of petro travel plaza llc  an unconsolidated limited liability company in which we are equity owners with petro stopping centers  lp total debt in the venture is approximately  and is related to the long term financing of the facility 
this guarantee will be reduced over the next two years as the principal balance on the loan is reduced through scheduled debt payments 
the remaining  of guarantees relate to debt within the tejon dermody industrial llc  an unconsolidated joint venture  formed to construct and market a  square foot building at the tejon industrial complex 
total debt in the venture is approximately  and was used in the construction of the building 
in the joint venture agreement  each partner agreed to guarantee one half of the outstanding debt through the term of the loan 
this loan has a current maturity date of march  the loan is currently in the process of being extended to january at this time we believe that neither of the guarantees nor the standby letter of credit will ever be called upon 
our current and future capital resource requirements will be provided primarily from current cash and marketable securities  cash flow from ongoing operations  proceeds from the sale of developed parcels  potential sale of assets  additional use of debt  proceeds from the reimbursement of public infrastructure costs through the community facilities district bond debt  and the issuance of common stock 
as noted above  we have  in cash and securities and  available on credit lines to meet any short term liquidity needs 
we continue to expect that substantial investments will need to be 
table of contents made in future years in our land assets to secure entitlements and develop the land 
in order to meet these long term capital requirements  we will need to secure additional debt financing and continue to renew our existing credit facilities 
in addition to debt financing  we will use other capital alternatives such as joint ventures with financial partners  sales of assets  and the issuance of common stock 
there is no assurance that we can obtain financing from any of these sources or that we can obtain financing at favorable terms 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial or commodity market prices or rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates and commodity prices 
financial market risks our exposure to financial market risks includes changes to interest rates and credit risks related to marketable securities  interest rates related to our outstanding indebtedness and trade receivables 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields and prudently managing risk 
to achieve this objective and limit interest rate exposure  we limit our investments to securities with a maturity of less than five years and an investment grade of a or better from moody s or standard and poors 
see note  marketable securities  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long term line of credit and the long term debt currently outstanding 
the line of credit interest rate can be tied to the lending bank s prime rate and would change when that rate changes  or the debt can be tied to a libor rate on a fixed basis and change only at maturity of the fixed rate feature 
currently  is outstanding on the line of credit 
a portion of the long term debt  has a fixed interest rate and the fair value of this long term debt will change based on interest rate movements in the market 
the remaining long term debt  can either be fixed for periods of time to a libor rate or float with the lending bank s prime rate 
the floating rate obligations expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest rates 
we believe it is prudent at times to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
to meet this objective  we entered into an interest rate swap to manage the potential fluctuations in cash flows resulting from interest rate risk 
see note  interest rate risk management  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
market risk related to our inventories ultimately depends on the value of the almonds  grapes  pistachios  and walnuts at the time of payment or sale 
credit risk related to our receivables depends upon the financial condition of our customers 
based on historical experience with current customers and periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions  we believe our credit risk is minimal 
market risk is discussed below in commodity price exposure

commodity price exposure we have exposure to adverse price fluctuations associated with certain inventories and accounts receivable 
inventories consist of farming and processing costs related to crop production 
the farming costs inventoried that are related to the crop are recorded at actual costs incurred 
historically  these costs have been recovered each year when that year s crop harvest has been sold 
with respect to accounts receivable  the amount at risk relates primarily to farm crops 
these receivables are recorded as estimates of the prices that ultimately will be received for the crops 
the final price is generally not known for several months following the close of our fiscal year 
of the accounts receivable outstanding at december    is at risk to changing prices 
of the 
table of contents amount at risk to changing prices   is attributable to almonds   to pistachios   to walnuts 
the comparable amounts of accounts receivable at december  were  related to almonds   related to pistachios  and  to walnuts 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable at december  was per pound for almonds 
for every 
change in the price of almonds  our receivable for almonds increases or decreases by  although the final price of almonds and therefore the extent of the risk is not presently known  over the last three years the final prices have ranged from to 
with respect to pistachios  the price estimated for recording the receivable was per pound  each 
change in the price increases or decreases the receivable by  and the range of final prices over the last three years for pistachios has been to 
the price estimated for recording accounts receivable for walnuts was 
per pound 
for every 
change in the price of walnuts  our receivable increases or decreases by  the final price for walnuts has averaged from
