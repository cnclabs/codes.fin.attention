item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a real estate investment trust specializing in multi family housing finance 
the company originates and acquires mezzanine loans  bridge loans  and government insured first mortgages secured by multi family housing properties throughout the united states 
the company seeks to increase the return on its asset base by investing in higher yielding assets while balancing risk by maintaining a portion of its investments in government insured or agency guaranteed loans 
the company primarily generates revenue from the collection of interest income from mezzanine loans  bridge loans  and debt securities 
the company also earns fees on standby loan commitments and stabilization guarantees that it makes 
the company is managed by an affiliate of chartermac  who provides services including  among other things  acquisition  financial  accounting  tax  capital markets  asset monitoring  portfolio management  investor relations  and public relation services 
a significant amount of the expenditures made by the company are in the form of fees paid to the advisor for these services rendered 
the company also incurs costs relating to interest expense on debt 
results of operations was a challenging year for the company as several of its loans went into default and the company took aggressive steps to protect its investments 
in certain instances this required the company to invest additional capital to acquire senior mortgage positions and subsequently foreclose its position to acquire the real estate securing the loans 
while the company believes that to date it has been successful in protecting its investments and over time it will recover all its invested capital  some of the steps taken resulted in capital being invested at returns lower than the company s targeted returns for a period of time 
this  combined with the lost interest due to defaulted loans  is the primary driver of the decrease in the company s net income per share from to as a result of the foreclosures  the company now has a significant amount of real estate owned on its balance sheet 
the company is focused on increasing the occupancy level and operating income of the properties to projected stabilization levels 
as property level operations improve  the company will seek to sell or refinance the properties with third parties such that the company can redeploy the capital invested in higher yielding investments

comparison of years ended december  and interest income from mortgage loans decreased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the sale of the columbiana mortgage during approximately  offset by additional construction period interest received from the club at brazos and northbrooke approximately 
the decrease can also be attributed to the conversion of the hollows  elmhurst village and autumn creek mortgages to gnma certificates approximately  the interest income on these assets was included in interest income from mortgage loans prior to conversion and in interest income from gnma certificates after the conversion 
conversely  interest income from gnma certificates increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the conversion of these three mortgage loans to gnma certificates approximately  and the purchase of an additional six gnma certificates in approximately  offset by the loss of interest income from the hollows gnma certificate approximately  which was sold in march of the increase in interest income from gnma certificates and the decrease in interest income from mortgage loans were  in part  a result of the interest income earned by these loans converted to gnma certificates subsequent to the conversion 
no gains or losses resulted from the conversion 
interest income from notes receivable increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the addition of nine notes receivable during and other income increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the collection of loan extension fees from autumn creek during interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the net effect of lower interest rates on repurchase facility borrowings and increased leverage

the company also paid to the advisor an incentive management fee of approximately  for  no such fee was paid in amortization and other expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to  primarily due to the fact that during the year ended december   the company recognized approximately  in fannie mae loan program expenses associated with the write off of the unamortized deferred costs related to this program  which is being discontinued 
the company has not recognized significant fee income from this program 
except for the write off of the program costs  this program has not  and its discontinuance is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operation 
a gain on the sale or repayment of gnmas and mortgage loans increased approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  due to the sale of the hollows gnma in march of approximately  and the repayment of the columbiana loans in approximately 
although the company intends to hold its gnma certificates until maturity  it elected available for sale designation under sfas to give it the flexibility to liquidate those assets if business conditions require 
the company decided to sell the hollows gnma when it received an unsolicited offer at an extremely favorable price

this loan balance was reclassified to real estate owned in may this loan balance was fully repaid october  weighted average interest rate 
liquidity and capital resources during  the company had three bridge loans and two mezzanine loans on which required debt service payments were not received  causing the notes to be in default 
in all five of these instances  the company has foreclosed on the property securing the note receivable and taken possession of the property 
the company goes through an extensive underwriting process prior to making its investments  and the company believes that these recent events of default are part of the risks and nature of making certain types of mezzanine investments 
while the company is working to preserve its invested capital  the defaults have had a negative impact on the company s cash flows in the short term  as required interest payments on the notes have not been received 
through recent independent appraisals on each of the properties  the company believes that it will be able to liquidate each of the properties at amounts greater than that of their carrying amounts 
the company sold three of the properties in and is currently managing the other two properties in an attempt to stabilize the properties for future marketing attempts 
during the year ended december   cash and cash equivalents decreased approximately  primarily due to funding of notes receivable of approximately  purchase of mortgage loans of approximately  investments in debt securities of approximately  funding of first mortgage loans of approximately  and repayments of repurchase facility payable of approximately  partially offset by repayments of mortgage loans of approximately  proceeds from repurchase facility payable of approximately  proceeds from the issuance of common shares of approximately  proceeds from the warehouse facility payable of approximately  principal repayments of debt securities of approximately  and a repayment of a notes receivable of approximately  the company finances the acquisition of its assets primarily through borrowing at short term rates using demand repurchase agreements and the mortgage warehouse line of credit see below 
under the company s declaration of trust  the company may incur permanent indebtedness of up to of total market value calculated at the time the debt is incurred 
permanent indebtedness and working capital indebtedness may not  in the aggregate  exceed of the company s total market value 
on april   the company completed a public offering of  common shares  at a price of per share  resulting in proceeds  net of underwriters discount and expenses  of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the public offering were used to fund investments 
the company has the capacity to raise an additional approximate amount of million in either common or preferred shares remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission during if market conditions warrant  the company may seek to raise additional funds up to this amount for investment through further common and or preferred offerings in the future  although the timing and amount of such offerings cannot be determined at this time 
effective february   the company entered into a repurchase facility with nomura securities international inc nomura 
this facility enables the company to borrow up to of the fair market value of gnma and fnma dus certificates owned by the company  which are pledged as collateral for the borrowings 
interest on borrowings are at day libor plus 
as of december  and december   the amount outstanding under this facility was approximately and million  respectively  and weighted average interest rates were and  respectively 
all borrowings under this facility typically have day settlement terms 
in january  nomura notified the company that it intended to terminate the repurchase facility 
nomura agreed to allow the company time to find a replacement repurchase facility  while reducing the amount the company could borrow under the existing facility to of the fair market value of the collateral certificates 
in february  the company executed repurchase agreements with three counterparties  greenwich capital  bear stearns  and rbc capital markets  which provides the company with the capacity to completely terminate the facility with nomura 
terms of the three newly executed agreements offer advance rates between and and borrowing rates between the libor plus basis points and libor plus basis points 
in the first week of march  the company executed multiple transactions whereby the repurchase transactions outstanding with nomura were transferred to the three new trading partners 
of the company s portfolio of debt securities  are in an unrealized loss position  totaling approximately  at december  all of these securities have been in an unrealized position for less than one year 
these unrealized losses are as a result of increases in interest rates subsequent to the acquisition of these securities 
all of the debt securities are performing according to their terms 
accordingly  the company has concluded that these impairments are not other than temporary 
in october  the company entered into the fleet warehouse facility with fleet national bank in the amount of million 
advances under the warehouse facility  up to of the total loan package  will be used to fund notes receivable  which the company will make to its customers for the acquisition refinancing and minor renovation of existing  lender approved multifamily properties located in stable sub markets 
the warehouse facility  which matures april  bears interest at a rate of   or day libor basis points  at the discretion of the company  payable monthly on advances 
principal is due upon the earlier of refinance or sale of the underlying property or upon maturity 
the company pays a fee of basis points  paid quarterly  on any unused portion of the facility 
from time to time  the company will use this facility to finance real estate owned 
as of december  and december   the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in loans outstanding under this program 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  as amended  the company must  among other things  distribute at least of its taxable income 
the company believes that it is in compliance with the reit related provisions of the code 
the company expects that cash generated from the company s investments  as well as cash generated from additional borrowings from the new repurchase facilities and fleet warehouse facility  will meet its needs for short term liquidity  and will be sufficient to pay all of the company s expenses and to make distributions to its shareholders in amounts sufficient to retain the company s reit status in the foreseeable future 
in february  a distribution of  
per share  which was declared in december  was paid to the shareholders for the quarter ended december  management is not aware of any trends or events  commitments or uncertainties  which have not otherwise been disclosed that will or are likely to impact liquidity in a material way 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are uncertain and that may change in later periods 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes involve the most significant estimates and assumptions 
the company s portfolio of mortgage loans and notes is periodically evaluated for possible impairment to establish appropriate loan loss reserves  if necessary 
the company s advisor has a credit review committee which meets each month 
this committee reviews the status of each of the company s loans and notes  and maintains a watch list of loans including loans for which the company has issued guarantees for which the underlying property may be experiencing construction cost overruns  delays in construction completion  occupancy shortfalls  lower than expected debt service coverage ratios  or other matters which might cause the borrower to be unable to make the interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
if a loan is experiencing difficulties  members of this credit committee work with the borrower to try to resolve the issues  which could include extending the loan term  making additional advances  or reducing required payments 
if  in the judgment of company management  it is determined that is probable that the company will not receive all contractually required payments when they are due  the loan or note would be deemed impaired  and a loan loss reserve established 
as of december   management has determined that no loan loss reserve is necessary 
the company s gnma and fnma dus certificates are carried at estimated fair values 
changes in these valuations do not impact the company s income or cash flows  but affect shareholders equity 
gnma and fnma dus certificates are relatively liquid investments 
the company uses third party quoted market prices as its primary source of valuation information 
the company s mezzanine investments of approximately million at december  bear interest at fixed or variable rates  but some also include provisions that allow the company to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s excess cash flows from operations and excess proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  company management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate  using the guidance contained in the third notice to practitioners issued by the aicpa 
although the accounting methodology does not affect the company s cash flows from these investments  this determination affects the balance sheet classification of the investments as well as the classification  timing and amounts of reported earnings 
accounting for the investment as real estate is required if the company expects that the amount of profit  whether called interest or another name  such as an equity kicker  that it expects to receive above a reasonable amount of interest and fees  is over percent of the property s total expected residual profit 
if a mezzanine investment were to be accounted for as an investment in real estate  the company s balance sheet would show the underlying property and its related senior debt if such debt were not also held by the company  and the income statement would include the property s rental revenues  operating expenses and depreciation 
if the company expects that it will receive less than percent of the property s residual profit  then loan or joint venture accounting is applied 
loan accounting is appropriate if the borrower has a substantial equity investment in the property  if the company has recourse to substantial assets of the borrower  if the property is generating sufficient cash flow to service normal loan amortization  or if certain other conditions are met 
under loan accounting  the company recognizes interest income as earned and additional interest from participations as received 
joint venture accounting would require that the company only record its share of the net income from the underlying property 
the company s management must exercise judgment in making the required accounting determinations 
for each mezzanine arrangement  the company projects total cash flows over the loan s term and the company s share in those cash flows  and considers the borrower s equity  the contractual cap  if any  on total yield to the company over the term of the loan  market yields on comparable loans  borrower guarantees  and other factors in making its assessment of the proper accounting 
to date  the company has determined that all mezzanine investments are properly accounted for as loans 
during  the company guaranteed certain loans related to the construction of affordable multifamily apartment complexes in various locations 
the loan guarantees provide credit support for the properties after construction completion  up until the date in which permanent financing takes place 
for each guarantee  the company monitors the status of the underlying properties and evaluates its exposure under the guarantees 
to date  the company has concluded that no accrual for probable losses is required under sfas during  the company entered into a five year interest rate swap  which is accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at the inception  the company designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge on the variable interest payments on its floating rate financing 
accordingly  the interest rate swap is recorded at fair market value each accounting period  with changes in market value being recorded in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting cash flows 
this hedge has been highly effective  so there has been no ineffectiveness included in earnings 
net amounts receivable or payable under the swap agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
during  the company exercised its rights under subordinated promissory notes and other documents to take possession of certain real estate collateral 
the company has also purchased the first mortgage loans on the properties and acquired the real estate at foreclosure auctions 
when a loan is in the process of foreclosure  it is the company s policy to reclassify the balance of the loan into real estate owned at the lower of fair value of the real estate  less estimated disposal costs or the carrying amount of the loan  and to cease accrual of interest 
the company obtains independent appraisals of all foreclosed real estate to assist management in evaluating property values 
to date  no losses have been recorded upon foreclosure 
during  in accordance with the incentive share option plan  the company s compensation committee granted  options to employees of related 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for its share options issued to non employees 
accordingly  compensation cost is accrued based on the estimated fair value of the options issued  and amortized over the vesting period 
because vesting of the options is contingent upon the recipient continuing to provide services to the company until the vesting date  the company estimates the fair value of the non employee options at each period end up to the vesting date  and adjusts expensed amounts accordingly 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
commitments and contingencies in the first quarter of  the company discontinued its loan program with fannie mae  under which fannie mae had agreed to fully fund the origination of million of delegated underwriter and servicer loans dus for apartment properties that qualify for low income housing tax credits lihtc under section of the internal revenue code 
under the loan program  the company originated and contracted for individual loans of up to million each 
the company guaranteed a first loss position of the aggregate principal amount of these loans and also guaranteed construction loans for which it had issued a forward commitment to originate under this program 
accordingly  the company wrote off approximately  of unamortized deferred costs relating to this program  which is included in other expenses on the consolidated statement of income 
in september  the company entered into a letter of agreement with pw funding inc pwf  a subsidiary of chartermac  each of which are affiliates of the advisor  under which the company transferred and assigned all of its rights and obligations to the two loans it originated under this program to pwf 
there was no payment made or received by the company in connection with this transfer 
chartermac has agreed to guarantee pwf s performance with regard to this program  which in turn  allowed for the release of approximately million in collateral pledged by the company to secure its obligations under the loan program 
in turn  the company indemnified pwf against any losses to fannie mae on the loans and indemnified chartermac against any obligation under its guaranty 
the maximum aggregate exposure to the company under this agreement is approximately million 
however  the company believes that it will not be called upon to fund any of these guarantees and  accordingly  that the fair value of the guarantees is insignificant 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no unconsolidated subsidiaries  special purpose off balance sheet financing entities  or other off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in conducting business  the company enters into various contractual obligations 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained below 
payments due by period dollars in thousands less than more than total year years years years debt lines of credit repurchase facility   fleet warehouse facility    mortgage loan   contingent liabilities standby and forward bridge loan commitments    standby and forward mezzanine loan commitments forward gnma commitments   stabilization loan guarantees    total     represents contractual maturity of mortgage loan on real estate owned 
however  it is the company s intention to find a buyer who will assume this obligation in the near term 
distributions of the total distributions of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively   
per share or represented a return of capital for the year ended december   determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
there was no return of capital for the year ended december  as of december   the aggregate amount of the distributions made since the commencement of the initial public offering representing a return of capital  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  totaled  the portion of the distributions which constituted a return of capital was made in order to maintain level distributions to shareholders

inflation inflation did not have a material effect on the company s results for the periods presented 
item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which the investments of the company are exposed is interest rate risk  which is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
interest rate risk interest rate fluctuations can adversely affect the company s income and value of its common shares in many ways and present a variety of risks  including the risk of mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
the company s operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from its assets net of credit losses and its borrowing costs 
most of the company s assets generate fixed returns and have terms in excess of five years 
the company funds the origination and acquisition of a significant portion of these assets with borrowings which have interest rates that reset relatively rapidly  such as monthly or quarterly 
in most cases  the income from assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of borrowings  creating a mismatch between asset yields and borrowing rates 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may influence the company s net income 
the company s borrowings under repurchase and warehouse agreements bear interest at rates that fluctuate with libor 
various financial vehicles exist which would allow company management to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the company s cash flows and earnings 
during march  upon management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies  the company entered into an interest rate swap in order to hedge against increases in the floating interest rate on its repurchase facility 
on march   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap agreement with fleet national bank fleet whereby the company has agreed to pay fleet a fixed on a notional amount of million 
in return  fleet will pay the company a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate on the same notional amount 
this effectively fixes million of the company s secured borrowings at  protecting the company in the event the day libor rate rises 
a possible risk of such swap agreements is the possible inability of fleet to meet the terms of the contracts with the company  however  there is no current indication of such an inability 
based on the million unhedged portion of million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities at december   a change in libor would impact the company s annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
however  due to the fact that the interest income from loans made under the fleet warehouse facility are also based on libor  a increase in libor would increase the company s annual net income and cash flows from such loans by approximately  increases in these rates will decrease the net income and market value of the company s net assets 
interest rate fluctuations that result in interest expense exceeding interest income would result in operating losses 
the value of the company s assets may be affected by prepayment rates on investments 
prepayment rates are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond the company s control  and consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
when the company originates mortgage loans  it expects that such mortgage loans will have a measure of protection from prepayment in the form of prepayment lock out periods or prepayment penalties 
however  such protection may not be available with respect to investments which the company acquires  but does not originate 
in periods of declining mortgage interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally increase 
if general interest rates decline as well  the proceeds of such prepayments received during such periods are likely to be reinvested by the company in assets yielding less than the yields on the investments that were prepaid 
in addition  the market value of mortgage investments may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less from declining interest rates than from other fixed income securities 
conversely  in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments on mortgages generally decrease  in which case the company would not have the prepayment proceeds available to invest in assets with higher yields 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios the company may fail to recoup fully its cost of acquisition of certain investments 
real estate risk multifamily and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty paying the company s mortgage loan  which could result in losses to the company 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the company s mortgage loans  which could also cause the company to suffer losses 
risk in owning subordinated interests the company has invested indirectly in subordinated cmbs through its ownership of a million preferred membership interest in arcap 
subordinated cmbs of the type in which arcap invests include first loss and non investment grade subordinated interests 
a first loss security is the most subordinate class in a structure and accordingly is the first to bear the loss upon a default on restructuring or liquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal 
such classes are subject to special risks  including a greater risk of loss of principal and non payment of interest than more senior  rated classes 
the market values of subordinated interests in cmbs and other subordinated securities tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior  rated classes 
as a result of these and other factors  subordinated interests generally are not actively traded and may not provide holders with liquidity of investment 
with respect to the company s investment in arcap  the ability to transfer the membership interest in arcap is further limited by the terms of arcap s operating agreement 
participating interest in connection with the acquisition and origination of mortgages  the company has  on occasion  obtained and may continue to obtain participating interests that may entitle it to payments based upon a development s cash flow  profits or any increase in the value of the development that would be realized upon a refinancing or sale of the development 
competition for participating interests is dependent to a large degree upon market conditions 
participating interests are more difficult to obtain when mortgage financing is available at relatively low interest rates 
in the current interest rate environment  the company may have greater difficulty obtaining participating interest 
participating interests are not government insured or guaranteed and are therefore subject to the general risks inherent in real estate investments 
therefore  even if the company is successful in investing in mortgage investments which provide for participating interests  there can be no assurance that such interests will result in additional payments 
repurchase facility collateral risk repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold by the company may decline and that the company will be required to post additional collateral  reduce the amount borrowed or suffer forced sales of the collateral 
if forced sales were made at prices lower than the carrying value of the collateral  the company would experience additional losses 
if the company is forced to liquidate these assets to repay borrowings  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain compliance with the reit asset and source of income requirements 
bridge and mezzanine loan risk the company has originated and expects to continue to originate bridge and mezzanine loans 
these types of mortgage loans are considered to involve a higher degree of risk than long term senior mortgage lending secured by income producing real property due to a variety of factors  including the loan becoming unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender 
the company may not recover some or all of its investment in such loans 
in addition  bridge loans and mezzanine loans may have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal
