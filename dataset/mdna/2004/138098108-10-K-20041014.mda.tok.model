previously  product service was reported as a separate business segment 
all prior period segment results have been restated to reflect this change 
the all other segment is comprised of the scientific operating segment and the company s new operating segment  specialty packaging  which was added as a result of the saf t pak acquisition on june  fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales contributed by biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal were  net sales of the company s pre existing business increased by  or  to  for fiscal compared with fiscal net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
carsen s net sales are principally included in the endoscopy and surgical and scientific segments 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis segment 
increases in selling prices of the company s products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales of the company s pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services and endoscope reprocessing products and services 
the increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services was primarily due to improved healthcare funding in canada  the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  the decrease in volume during certain periods of fiscal due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in the greater toronto area which prevented the company s sales personnel from visiting hospitals  enhanced offerings of surgical products and the effect of reorganizing carsen s sales force 
net sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services increased by in us dollars and in their functional canadian currency during fiscal as compared with fiscal healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations 
canada recently adopted a budget that provides for a significant increase in funding for healthcare 
however  the company cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation or the new budget will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products and services 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and service of in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to an increase in sales volume for endoscope disinfection equipment in the united states  and an increase in endoscope reprocessing consumables and product service due to increased volume related to the increased field population of equipment 
sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in sales volume of the number of units of the company s concentrate product a concentrated acid used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment to several major us dialysis chains and to a new international customer  partially offset by a decrease in demand for the company s renatron product dialyzer reprocessing equipment as well as lower selling prices for the company s renalin products sterilant 
sales of filtration and separation products increased by in fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in demand for the company s hemoconcentrator product a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and hemofilter product a device used for slow  continuous blood filtration therapy used to control fluid overload and acute renal failure in unstable  critically ill patients that cannot tolerate the rapid filtration rates of conventional hemodialysis 
the increase in demand for the company s hemoconcentrator product was partially due to the departure of a competitor from the international hemoconcentrator market 
partially offsetting the increase in sales of hemoconcentrators and hemofilters was the completion of a private label manufacturing contract in fiscal which was not replaced with a similar contract in fiscal gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal was  gross profit of the company s pre existing business increased by  or to  in fiscal as compared with fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales of the company s pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for biolab  mar cor and saf t pak in fiscal was the higher gross profit percentage from the company s pre existing business in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable canadian dollar exchange rates during fiscal  improved overhead absorption in the endoscope reprocessing segment due to increased volume  favorable sales mix in the endoscopy and surgical and filtration and separation segments  and higher charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to the company s endoscope reprocessing products incurred during fiscal partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage were a lower gross profit percentage in the company s dialysis products due to increased sales of concentrate products which typically carry a lower gross profit  and a lower gross profit percentage in the service portion of the endoscope reprocessing segment due to sales mix of services provided and a  charge including a  impairment charge to write down certain assets during fiscal for costs pertaining to the closing of the company s boston dialyzer reprocessing center 
the favorable canadian dollar exchange rates lowered carsen s cost of inventory purchased  and therefore decreased cost of sales and increased gross profit  by approximately  in fiscal compared with fiscal in addition  gross profit was positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s gross profit using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar which also impacts net sales and therefore has no impact on gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
selling expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to  of biolab s  mar cor s and saf t pak s fiscal selling expenses  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  the translation of carsen s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and the addition of sales representatives and management personnel in the endoscopy and surgical segment 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with for fiscal the decrease in selling expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of increased net sales against the fixed component of selling expenses  as well as the inclusion of the lower cost structure related to the biolab and mar cor operations  partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation and the addition of sales representatives and management personnel in the endoscopy and surgical segment 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to  of biolab s  mar cor s and saf t pak s fiscal general and administrative expenses  a  provision for legal claims recorded during fiscal  increased costs relating to corporate governance of approximately  in fiscal  favorable adjustments during fiscal in the amounts of  and  resulting from the settlement of liabilities initially recorded in conjunction with the minntech acquisition relating to sales tax and severance  respectively  an increase in incentive compensation of approximately  the translation of carsen s expenses using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar  and an increase in the cost of commercial insurance 
partially offsetting these increases were foreign exchange losses in fiscal associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies  and a  pre acquisition workers compensation claim that was assessed on the company by the state of minnesota during fiscal due to the bankruptcy of minntech s former insurance carrier 
research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to a reduction in continuing engineering associated with the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment and the billing of certain research and development services performed under a customer contract 
in fiscal  interest expense increased by  to  from  in fiscal principally due to the increased borrowings  net of repayments  under the us credit facilities for the mar cor and saf t pak acquisitions and incremental amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the amended credit facilities  partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to the use of cash to acquire biolab 
income before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech in fiscal  cantel eliminated the valuation allowances previously existing against its deferred tax assets related to the federal net operating loss carryforwards nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   the company has provided in its results of operations income tax expense for its united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
at july   such nols were approximately  the company s results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for its international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
such international subsidiaries include the company s subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan  which had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
the company s us effective tax rate was during fiscal the higher overall effective tax rate for fiscal as compared with fiscal is principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  an increase in the ontario  canada provincial tax rate enacted on january  and operating losses in the company s netherlands subsidiary for which no tax benefit was recorded 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal net sales contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
net sales of the company s pre existing businesses increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
carsen s net sales are principally included in the endoscopy and surgical and scientific segments 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of minntech s netherlands subsidiary net sales using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
the majority of the net sales of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are included in the dialysis segment 
increases in the price of the company s products during fiscal did not have a significant effect on net sales 
the increase in sales of the company s pre existing businesses was attributable to an increase in sales of scientific products  endoscope reprocessing products and service  and endoscopy and surgical products 
the increase in sales of scientific products was primarily due to an increase in volume of approximately for microscopy  imaging and industrial products 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing products was primarily due to an increase in volume of approximately in the united states for endoscope disinfection equipment and related consumables 
the increase in sales of endoscope reprocessing service was primarily due to increased volume related to the increased field population of the company s endoscope disinfection equipment in the marketplace 
the increase in sales of endoscopy and surgical products was primarily due to the translation of carsen s net sales using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
sales of endoscopy and surgical products continue to be adversely impacted by healthcare funding issues in canada as well as intensified competition  which competition the company expects to continue 
healthcare funding in canada is dependent upon governmental appropriations 
although canada recently adopted a budget that provides for a significant increase in funding for diagnostic healthcare products  the company cannot ascertain what impact the funding situation or the new budget will have on future sales of endoscopy and surgical products 
additionally  the sale of endoscopy and surgical products during fiscal was adversely impacted by the outbreak of sars in the greater toronto area which prevented the company s sales personnel from visiting hospitals 
the company s endoscopy and surgical business could be materially and adversely affected by a future outbreak of sars in canada 
the company believes that it has the opportunity to continue increasing market share in all of its existing operating segments with the exception of the product service portion of its endoscopy and surgical segment 
the majority of the company s existing endoscopy and surgical product service pertains to the servicing of flexible endoscopes in canada 
the company s market share in its flexible endoscope service business in canada is substantial  therefore  growth opportunities for its existing service business may be limited without the addition of new product servicing opportunities 
the increase in sales of the company s dialysis products and filtration and separation products is due to the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal this increase in sales of dialysis products was partially offset by a decrease in volume of the company s renatron reprocessing product 
this increase in sales of the company s filtration and separation products was partially offset by a decrease in volume of the company s hemofilters due to the loss of a major european distributor  as well as the decrease in volume of hemoconcentrators as a result of the medical community moving towards an alternative medical procedure that does not require the use of a hemoconcentrator 
if the company had owned minntech for the entire fiscal year  the decrease in volume of renatrons  hemofilters  and hemoconcentrators in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  would have been approximately   and  respectively 
the company does not expect sales of renatrons and hemofilters to increase in fiscal and anticipates a continuing decline in the sales of hemoconcentrators 
gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by minntech excluding medivators for fiscal and was  and  respectively 
gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses increased by  or  to  for fiscal  from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  compared with for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales of the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal and was and  respectively 
during fiscal  gross profit of the company s pre existing businesses was adversely impacted by  in charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to the company s endoscope reprocessing products  which charges were incurred predominantly in the second quarter 
the comparable amount of these charges in fiscal was approximately  therefore  the increase in these charges of  reduced gross profit percentage by for fiscal the company does not expect a level of warranty expense in the future similar to fiscal minntech s gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding medivators for fiscal and was and  respectively 
the lower gross profit percentage from the company s pre existing businesses for fiscal  as compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to the charges for warranty and slow moving inventory related to the company s endoscope reprocessing products  sales mix as well as an increase in the cost to manufacture the current models of the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment  an increased cost structure in the product service portion of carsen s endoscopy and surgical business to support anticipated increases in sales that did not occur  continued competition in endoscopy and surgical and scientific products  and manufacturing overhead associated with medivators relocation into minntech s facilities 
partially offsetting these decreases in gross profit percentage were favorable canadian dollar exchange rates which lowered carsen s cost of inventory purchased and therefore decreased cost of sales by approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal with respect to minntech  the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to sales mix of dialysis products  particularly with respect to decreased sales of the renatron reprocessing product  as well as unfavorable overhead absorption 
partially offsetting these decreases in gross profit percentage was a  charge to cost of sales in fiscal related to the sale of inventories which carried a step up in value as a result of purchase accounting 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were for fiscal  compared with for fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and expanded marketing efforts at minntech to support worldwide sales  and the inclusion of the higher selling cost structure related to the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  principally due to favorable adjustments in the amounts of  and  resulting from the settlement of liabilities initially recorded in conjunction with the minntech acquisition relating to sales tax and severance  respectively  efficiencies realized as a result of the minntech acquisition  including the subsequent relocation of the medivators operations into minntech s facilities  a decrease in bad debt expense due to significant charges incurred in the prior year  and a reduction in incentive compensation and the cost of employee benefit programs 
partially offsetting these decreases were the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal  an increase in the cost of commercial insurance  foreign exchange losses associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies  and a  pre acquisition workers compensation claim that was recently assessed on the company by the state of minnesota due to the bankruptcy of minntech s former insurance carrier 
research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  principally due to expanded activities in minntech s including medivators dialysis  filtration and separation  and endoscope reprocessing segments  as well as the inclusion of the minntech operations for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal interest expense decreased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of lower average outstanding borrowings and lower interest rates during fiscal additionally  during fiscal there was a  write off of fees in connection with a prior credit facility 
partially offsetting these decreases were outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facilities for the entire fiscal year  as compared to a partial period since the date of the acquisition for fiscal income from operations before income taxes increased by  to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
in conjunction with the purchase accounting for the acquisition of minntech  cantel eliminated the valuation allowances previously existing against its deferred tax assets related to the federal nols accumulated in the united states 
therefore  for all periods subsequent to september   the company has provided in its results of operations income tax expense for its united states operations at the statutory tax rate  however  actual payment of us federal income taxes reflects the benefits of the utilization of the nols 
at july   such nols were approximately  the company s results of operations for fiscal and also reflect income tax expense for its international subsidiaries at their respective statutory rates 
the company s international subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands and japan had effective tax rates during fiscal of approximately  and  respectively 
the lower overall effective tax rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  a reduction in the canadian statutory tax rate  and an overall reduction in the estimated us state tax rate 
for fiscal  the company s overall tax rate is expected to be primarily affected by the geographic mix of pretax income 
liquidity and capital resources at july   the company s working capital was  compared with  at july  this increase in working capital was principally due to the acquisitions of biolab  mar cor and saf t pak

carsen was subject to minimum purchase requirements under the olympus agreement during the contract year ended march   which carsen has satisfied 
both agreements expired on march   however  the olympus agreement provided that if carsen fulfilled its obligations thereunder  such agreement would be extended through march  accordingly  the olympus agreement has been extended through march  and new minimum purchase requirements of  and  for the contract years ending march  and  respectively  have been established for the extended term

failure by olympus to achieve the minimum purchase projections in any contract year gives minntech the option to terminate the medivators agreement 
the medivators agreement expires on august  despite the fact that olympus historically has not achieved the minimum purchase projections  the company has elected not to terminate or significantly restructure the medivators agreement because the company believes that olympus existing domestic distribution capabilities continue to provide the company with the broadest distribution and profit potential for its endoscope reprocessing products 
the company has determined that it will repatriate minimal amounts of existing and future accumulated profits from its international locations until existing domestic nols are exhausted  which the company estimates to be approximately the end of fiscal notwithstanding this strategy  the company believes that its current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  including its us operations and the funds available under its revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon its existing operations  including the acquisitions during fiscal at september   approximately  was available under the revolving credit facilities 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar had a positive impact upon the company s results of operations 
such currency fluctuations also result in a corresponding change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in canadian dollars 
under the canadian revolving credit facility  carsen has a  united states dollars foreign currency hedging facility  as amended  which is available to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on purchases of inventories 
total commitments for foreign currency forward contracts under this facility amounted to  united states dollars at september  and cover approximately of carsen s projected purchases of inventories for fiscal and a minor portion of projected inventory purchases for fiscal these foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments 
the weighted average exchange rate of the forward contracts open at september  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on september  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
during fiscal compared with fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
during fiscal  such strengthening of the euro relative to the united states dollar had an overall adverse impact upon the company s results of operations 
such currency fluctuations also result in a change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  the company enters into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts have been designated as fair value hedges 
there was one foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at september  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars 
such contract expired on september  under its credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting the adverse impact of the strengthening of the euro on the company s results of operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all of the company s foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
recognition of gains and losses related to the canadian hedges is deferred within other comprehensive income until settlement of the underlying commitments  and realized gains and losses are recorded within cost of sales upon settlement 
gains and losses related to the hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet  at july  compared to july   the value of the canadian dollar and the value of the euro increased by approximately and  respectively  compared to the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  during fiscal  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either the company s results of operations or the translation of its balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that the company s japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  earnings and net assets 
inflation has not significantly impacted the company s operations 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company continually evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales excluding certain sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  filtration and separation  packaging and a portion of endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when the company s distribution fleet is utilized 
with respect to endoscopy and surgical  water treatment and scientific products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of the company s product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of the company s water treatment products and an insignificant amount of the company s sales of dialysis equipment and scientific products  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical  water treatment and scientific product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
with respect to a portion of endoscopy and surgical sales  the company enters into arrangements whereby revenue is immediately recognized upon the transfer of equipment to customers who pay on a cost per procedure basis  subject to minimum monthly payments 
such arrangements are non cancelable by the customer and provide for a bargain purchase option by the customer at the conclusion of the term 
all direct costs related to these transactions are recorded at the time of revenue recognition 
some of such transactions also provide for future servicing of the equipment  which service revenue component is deferred and recognized over the period that such services are provided 
with respect to these multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to the equipment and service components based upon vendor specific objective evidence which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and service sold as stand alone components 
sales of a majority of the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment to a third party distributor in the united states are recognized on a bill and hold basis as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
such sales satisfy each of the following criteria i the risks of ownership have passed to the third party distributor  ii the third party distributor must provide a written purchase order committing to the purchase of specified units  iii the bill and hold arrangement was specifically requested by the third party distributor for the purpose of minimizing the impact of multiple shipments of the units  iv the third party distributor provides specific instructions for shipment to customers  and completed units held by the company for the third party distributor generally do not exceed three months of anticipated shipments  v the company has no further performance obligations with respect to such units  vi completed units are invoiced to the third party distributor with day payment terms and such receivables are generally satisfied within such terms  and vii completed units are ready for shipment and segregated in a designated section of the company s warehouse reserved only for the third party distributor 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at the company s facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of the company s sales  including the bill and hold sales arrangement  contain right of return provisions  and customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by the company before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of the company s sales of dialysis products and certain prepaid packaging products 
price protection is not offered by the company  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of the company s products 
with respect to certain of the company s dialysis product customers  volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided  such volume rebates and trade in allowances are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume and trade ins for the entire rebate agreement periods 
the increase in rebates for fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to additional volume rebate agreements for the company s renalin sterilant product and endoscopy reprocessing products 
trade in allowances were not significant during fiscal if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of the company s dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of filtration and separation products and endoscope reprocessing products and services are sold to third party distributors  the majority of endoscopy and surgical products and services are sold directly to hospitals  the majority of water treatment products and services are sold to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  scientific products and services are sold to hospitals  laboratories and other end users  and packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow the company s revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of the company s business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  the company must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  the company uses historical experience as well as current market information 
in one such evaluation in fiscal  the company determined that certain parts relating to the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment were obsolete  primarily due to design changes  resulting in an additional provision of approximately  with few exceptions  the saleable value of the company s inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of the company s inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of the company s identifiable intangible assets  including technology  customer relationships  patents and non compete agreements  are amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  the company has recorded goodwill and trademarks and tradenames  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of the company s intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the company s management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing its annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of the company s intangible assets or goodwill was impaired since the individual fair values exceeded their carrying values 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of future operating results of the company which management believes to be reasonable 
warranties the company provides for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of the company s products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of the company s products have a one year warranty  although a majority of the company s endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states may carry a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
the company records provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on the company s results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
in one such review during fiscal  the company s results of operations were adversely impacted by an additional charge of approximately  related to endoscope reprocessing equipment due to a component failure which required warranty service to many endoscope reprocessing units in the field 
management believes this situation was fully remedied in fiscal income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
such a review considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the united states effective tax rate were to change in the future  the company s items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for possible exposures as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
the company establishes the reserves based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies and permanent tax differences 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically at least annually and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserves 
the majority of the company s income tax reserves originated from acquisitions  therefore  changes to such reserves  if any  would be adjusted through goodwill 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities are subjective in nature 
the company reflects such liabilities based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with the company s acquisitions  such subjective liabilities principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
other matters the company does not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risk a portion of the company s products are imported from the far east and western europe  minntech sells a portion of its products outside of the united states  and minntech s netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  the company s business could be materially affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
carsen imports a substantial portion of its products from the united states and pays for such products in united states dollars 
additionally  a portion of the sales of biolab and saf t pak are to customers in the united states 
carsen s  biolab s and saf t pak s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  carsen s  including its biolab subsidiary  and saf t pak s financial statements are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had a positive impact in fiscal compared with fiscal  and in fiscal compared with fiscal  upon the company s results of operations and stockholders equity  as described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in order to hedge against the impact of such currency fluctuations on the purchases of inventories  carsen enters into foreign currency forward contracts on firm purchases of such inventories in united states dollars 
these foreign currency forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedge instruments 
total commitments for such foreign currency forward contracts amounted to  united states dollars at july   at july  and cover a majority of carsen s projected purchases of inventories through july changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar affect the company s results of operations because a portion of the net assets of minntech s netherlands subsidiary are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  financial statements of the netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the european union and the united states had an overall adverse impact for fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon the company s results of operations  and had a positive impact upon stockholders equity  as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar  the company enters into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts have been designated as fair value hedge instruments 
there was one such foreign currency forward contract amounting to  at july  which covers certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
such contract expired on august  under its credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
during fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting the adverse impact of the strengthening of the euro on the company s results of operations 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal and did not have a significant impact upon either the company s results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that the company s japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  earnings and net assets 
interest rate market risk the company has two credit facilities for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
therefore  interest expense is principally affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states and canada 
during fiscal  all of the company s outstanding borrowings were under its united states credit facilities 
in order to protect its interest rate exposure  the company had entered into a three year interest rate cap that expired on september  covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility  which capped libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
this interest rate cap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge instrument 
at july   the fair value of such interest rate cap was less than  market risk sensitive transactions the company is exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  the company s outstanding debt is under its us credit facilities described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such us credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally for libor contracts 
therefore  the company s market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under the us credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
the company s other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
the company also maintained a significant cash balance of  at july  which is invested in low rate  low risk cash equivalents 
an increase in interest rates would likely generate additional interest income for the company which could partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
presently  the company does not utilize any interest rate derivatives 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  the company is principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar and the euro as these currencies relate to the us dollar 
in order to minimize the potential adverse impact of unfavorable movements in these two foreign currencies  the company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products from us suppliers and is therefore exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar depreciates relative to the us dollar 
a adverse movement in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar exchange rate could result in an unrealized loss of approximately  at july  based upon the level of commitments for foreign currency forward contracts on such purchases of inventories compared with approximately  at july  the increase in such exposure is reflective of the company s desire to increase its portfolio of such foreign exchange forward contracts due to an improvement in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during fiscal the company s netherlands subsidiary has net assets in currencies other than its functional currency principally us dollars which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  the company s netherlands subsidiary is exposed to risk if the value of the euro appreciates relative to the us dollar 
a adverse movement in the euro exchange rate relative to the us dollar could result in a realized loss of approximately  at july  based upon the level of commitments for foreign currency forward contracts compared with approximately  at july  however  since the company s netherlands subsidiary limits the use of foreign currency forward contracts to the hedging of actual net assets  this loss in fair value for such instruments generally would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of the underlying net assets 
overall  based upon the level of all foreign currency forward contracts  the company s aggregate exposure at july  and was approximately  and  respectively  which would be offset by gain in the value of the underlying hedged net assets of the netherlands subsidiary 
if the company s canadian subsidiary did not utilize foreign currency forward contracts  based upon estimated annual purchasing levels a adverse movement in the canadian dollar exchange rate could result in future annual incremental cost of sales of approximately  in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of the company s financial statements adverse changes would be caused by depreciation of either the canadian dollar and the euro relative to the us dollar 
for fiscal and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries 
furthermore  a adverse movement in foreign currency rates could result in an unrealized loss of  and  at july  and  respectively  on the company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since the company views these investments as long term  the company would not expect such a loss to be realized in the near term
