the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements include estimates as to the recovery of receivables and the realization of inventories  plant and equipment  and goodwill 
significant assumptions are also used in the determination of liabilities related to pension and post retirement benefits  obligations for lease terminations  income taxes and environmental matters 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  and in some cases  actuarial assumptions 
the corporation re evaluates these significant factors as facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from those determined using the estimates described above 
the corporation believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to selected revenue recognition issues 
in addition  revenues in the supply chain management segment are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
each major contract is evaluated based on various criteria  with management judgment required to assess the importance of each criterion in reaching the final decision 
revenue is recognized on a gross basis if the corporation has the risks and rewards of ownership  latitude in establishing component vendors and pricing  and bears all credit risk 
revenues from contracts that do not meet these criteria are recognized on a net basis  recording only the portion that is related to services or products provided directly by the corporation 
goodwill

 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective december  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis

the corporation completed the annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each of and this analysis was based on the comparison of the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of the net assets of the respective reporting units 
the corporation concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the time of the annual impairment test in during  the corporation determined that goodwill for one of its reporting units was impaired and  accordingly  the corporation recognized a goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of of million 
retirement benefits 
the corporation has significant pension and post retirement benefit costs that are developed from actuarial valuations 
the valuations reflect key assumptions regarding  among other things  discount rates  expected return on plan assets  retirement ages and years of service 
consideration is given to current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and investment returns  in making these assumptions 
changes in these assumptions will affect the amount of pension and post retirement expense recognized in future periods 
the corporation recognized pension and post retirement benefit expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively
