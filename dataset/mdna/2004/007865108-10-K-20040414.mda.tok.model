the equity based compensation expense totaled million  of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
we recorded equity based compensation expense of million in cost of sales for transition and the fifty two weeks ended february  we incurred additional amortization for equity based compensation of million in fiscal  as a result of the acceleration of the unamortized balance of such equity based compensation associated with the immediate vesting of options upon the consummation of the initial public offering 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include selling  store management and corporate expenses  including payroll and employee benefits other than for our design  buying and merchandising personnel  employment taxes  management information systems  marketing  insurance  legal  store pre opening and other corporate level expenses 
store pre opening expenses include store level payroll  grand opening event marketing  travel  supplies and other store opening expenses

cumulative effect of accounting change 
on august   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires companies to no longer amortize negative goodwill 
the cumulative effect of this change resulted in a gain of million in transition critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates except for the change in estimated useful lives in fiscal described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which require significant management estimates and are described below 
merchandise inventory 
inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market  we make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and current information and can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
finite lived assets 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of finite lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets and reduce their carrying value by the excess  if any  of the result of such calculation 
this analysis includes factors such as future sales and projected profit margins 
we believe at this time that the finite lived assets carrying values and useful lives continues to be appropriate

cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors this report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of such forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding the company s strategic direction  prospects and future results 
certain factors  including factors outside of our control  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update or revise such forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after such statements are made 
such uncertainties include  among others  the following factors our growth strategy relies on the continued addition of a significant number of new stores each year  which could strain our resources and cause the performance of our existing stores to suffer 
our growth will largely depend on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully 
we opened stores in fiscal  in fiscal  and stores in fiscal we plan to open approximately stores in fiscal  an increase of over our store base as of the end of fiscal we intend to continue to open a significant number of new stores in future years while remodeling a portion of our existing store base annually 
our proposed expansion will place increased demands on our operational  managerial and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our individual stores 
in addition  to the extent that our new store openings are in existing markets  we may experience reduced net sales volumes in existing stores in those markets 
our expansion plan is dependent on a number of factors  which could delay or prevent the successful opening of new stores and subsequent penetration into new markets 
we will be unable to open and operate new stores successfully and our growth will be limited unless we can identify suitable markets and sites for store locations  negotiate acceptable lease terms  hire  train and retain competent store personnel  maintain a proportion of new stores to mature stores that does not harm existing sales  foster current relationships and develop new relationships with vendors that are capable of supplying a greater volume of merchandise  manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis  expand our infrastructure to accommodate growth  and generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure adequate capital on commercially reasonable terms to fund our expansion plans 
in addition  we will open new stores in regions of the united states in which we currently have few or no stores 
our experience in these markets is limited and we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop our brand in these markets or adapt to competitive  merchandising and distribution challenges that may be different from those in our existing markets 
our inability to open new stores successfully and or penetrate new markets would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings growth 
our net sales and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis  leaving our operating results particularly susceptible to changes in back to school and holiday shopping patterns 
our net sales and net income are disproportionately higher from august through january each year due to increased sales from back to school and holiday shopping 
sales during this period cannot be used as an accurate indicator of annual results 
our net sales and net income from february through july are typically lower due  in part  to the traditional retail slowdown immediately following the winter holiday season 
any significant decrease in sales during the back to school and winter holiday seasons would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in order to prepare for the back to school and holiday shopping seasons  we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry during other parts of the year 
any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during these peak shopping seasons could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown  which could reduce our net sales and gross margins and negatively impact our profitability 
fluctuations in comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to decline substantially 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the recent levels of comparable store sales as we expand our business 
our comparable store sales and quarterly results of operations are affected by a variety of factors  including fashion trends  calendar shifts of holiday or seasonal periods  the effectiveness of our inventory management  changes in our merchandise mix  the timing of promotional events  weather conditions  changes in general economic conditions and consumer spending patterns  and actions of competitors or mall anchor tenants 
if our future comparable store sales fail to meet the expectations of research analysts  then the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 
you should refer to the section entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
if we are unable to identify and respond to consumers fashion preferences in a timely manner  our profitability would decline 
we may be unable to keep pace with the rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes inherent in the apparel industry 
our current design philosophy is based on the belief that our target customers prefer clothing that suits the demands of their active lifestyles and that they like to identify with a logo 
accordingly  we produce casual  comfortable apparel  a majority of which displays either the aeropostale or aero logo 
we cannot assure you that fashion trends will not move away from casual clothing or that we will not have to alter our design strategy to reflect a consumer change in logo preference 
if we fail to anticipate  identify or react appropriately to changes in styles  trends  desired images or brand preferences  we may need to incur higher markdowns to reduce excess inventory 
utilizing such markdowns would negatively impact our profitability 
our concentration of stores in the eastern united states makes susceptible to adverse conditions in this region 
the majority of our stores are located in the eastern half of the united states 
as a result  our operations are more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  economic and weather conditions  as well as demographic and population changes 
we rely on third parties to manage the warehousing and distribution aspects of our business 
if these third parties do not adequately perform these functions  our business would be disrupted 
the efficient operation of our stores is dependent on our ability to distribute merchandise to locations throughout the united states in a timely manner 
our distribution and warehouse facility in south river  new jersey is operated by an independent third party 
we depend on this third party to receive  sort  pack and distribute substantially all of our merchandise 
this third party employs personnel represented by a labor union 
although there have been no work stoppages or disruptions since the inception of our relationship with this third party provider in  we cannot assure you that there will be no disruptions in the future 
we also use a separate third party transportation company to deliver our merchandise from our warehouses to our stores 
any failure by either of these third parties to respond adequately to our warehousing and distribution needs would disrupt our operations and negatively impact our profitability 
we rely on a small number of vendors to supply a significant amount of our merchandise  and our failure to maintain good relationships with one or more of them could harm our ability to source our products 
in fiscal  we sourced of our merchandise from our top three vendors 
mfm mias fashion mfg 
co  inc supplied  and niteks usa  inc 
and south bay apparel  inc each supplied of our products 
in addition  federated merchandising group  or fmg  a wholly owned subsidiary of federated department stores  inc  acted as our agent with respect to the sourcing of of our merchandise 
our relationships with our vendors generally are not on a contractual basis and do not assure adequate supply  quality or acceptable pricing on a long term basis 
most of our vendors could discontinue selling to us at any time 
if one or more of our significant vendors were to sever their relationship with us  we could be unable to obtain replacement products in a timely manner  which could cause our sales to decrease 
most of our merchandise is manufactured by foreign suppliers  therefore the availability and costs of these products may be negatively affected by risks associated with international trade 
trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas  or both  could affect the importation of apparel generally and increase the cost and reduce the supply of merchandise available to us 
much of our merchandise is sourced directly from foreign vendors in europe  asia and central america 
in addition  many of our domestic vendors maintain production facilities overseas 
some of these facilities are also located in regions which may be affected by political instability which could cause a disruption in trade 
any reduction in merchandise available to us or any increase in its cost due to tariffs  quotas or local political issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the departure of certain members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
the success of our business is dependent upon our senior management closely supervising all aspects of our business  in particular the operation of our stores and the designing of our merchandise 
if we were to lose the benefit of this involvement  and in particular if we were to lose the services of julian r 
geiger  our chairman and chief executive officer  and christopher l 
finazzo  our executive vice president chief merchandising officer  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  mr 
geiger and mr 
finazzo maintain many of our vendor relationships  and the loss of either of them could negatively impact present vendor relationships 
you should refer to the section entitled management for more information 
our failure to protect our trademarks aeropostale r and  to a lesser extent  aero tm adequately could have a negative impact on our brand image and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 
we believe that our trademarks aeropostale r and or to a lesser extent  aero tm are integral to our logo driven design strategy 
we have obtained a federal registration of the aeropostale r trademark in the united states and have applied for or obtained registrations in most foreign countries in which our vendors are located 
we use the term aero in many constantly changing designs and logos even though we have not applied to register the every variation or combinations thereof for adult clothing 
we cannot assure you that the registrations we obtained will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others 
if any third party imitates our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation  our brand image could be materially adversely affected 
because we have not yet obtained federal registration for the aero tm mark and have not registered the aeropostale mark in all categories or in all foreign countries in which we now or may in the future source or offer our merchandise  international expansion and our merchandising of non apparel products using these marks could be limited 
in addition  we cannot assure you that others will not try to block the manufacture  export or sale of our products as violative of their trademarks or other proprietary rights 
other entities may have rights to trademarks that contain the word aero or may have registered similar or competing marks for apparel and accessories in foreign countries in which our vendors are located 
our applications for international registration of the aeropostale r mark have been rejected in a few countries in which our products are manufactured because third parties have already registered the mark for clothing in those countries 
there may be other prior registrations in other foreign countries of which we are not aware 
in all such countries  it may be possible for any third party owner of the national trademark registration for aeropostale to enjoin the manufacture  sale or exportation of aeropostale branded goods to the united states 
if we were unable to reach a licensing arrangement with these parties  our vendors may be unable to manufacture our products in those countries 
our inability to register our trademarks or purchase or license the right to use our trademarks or logos in these jurisdictions could limit our ability to obtain supplies from or manufacture in less costly markets or penetrate new markets should our business plan change to include selling our merchandise in those jurisdictions outside the united states 
our ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on the success of the shopping malls in which we are located 
in order to generate customer traffic we must locate our stores in prominent locations within successful shopping malls 
we cannot control the development of new shopping malls  the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls  or the success of individual shopping malls 
furthermore  factors beyond our control impact mall traffic  such as general economic conditions and consumer spending levels 
a continued slowdown in the united states economy could negatively affect consumer spending and reduce mall traffic 
a significant decrease in shopping mall traffic would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism  heightened security measures and military action in response to an act of terrorism has disrupted commerce and has intensified the uncertainty of the us economy 
any further acts of terrorism or a future war may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence  which could negatively impact our sales revenue by causing consumer spending and or mall traffic to decline 
furthermore  an act of terrorism or war  or the threat thereof  could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from foreign vendors 
inability to obtain merchandise from our foreign vendors or substitute suppliers at similar costs in a timely manner could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our market share may be adversely impacted at any time by a significant number of competitors 
the teen apparel market is highly competitive and is characterized by low barriers to entry 
we compete against a diverse group of retailers  including national and local specialty retail stores  mass merchandisers  regional retail chains  traditional department stores and mail order retailers 
many of our competitors are already established in markets that we have not penetrated 
in addition  many of our competitors have many more stores in operation than us  and therefore greater national recognition than we do 
our market share and results of operations may be adversely impacted by this significant number of competitors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
the company  in the normal course of doing business  is theoretically exposed to interest rate change market risk 
as borrowing patterns are seasonal  the company is not dependent on borrowing for the entire year 
therefore  a sudden increase in interest rates which under the loan agreement is dependent on the prime rate may  during peak borrowing  have a negative impact on short term results
