item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily receive our revenue from earned premium derived from our insurance company operations  fee income generated by our underwriting agency operations  commission income produced by our intermediary operations  proceeds from ceded reinsurance ceding commissions in excess of acquisition costs earned by our insurance company subsidiaries  investment income from all of our operations and other operating income 
our core underwriting activities involve providing group life  accident and health  diversified financial products  london market account  aviation and other specialty lines of business  each of which is marketed by our insurance companies and our underwriting agencies either directly to customers or through a network of independent or affiliated agents  third party administrators and brokers 
during the past several years  we have substantially increased our shareholders equity through the issuance of equity securities and through retaining our earnings  thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies and make acquisitions 
with this additional equity  we increased underwriting activity across many of our businesses and added new lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle 
as an insurer  we also purchase reinsurance for each of our lines of business 
we purchase different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for each of our lines of business based upon market conditions and the level of risk we wish to retain 
market conditions improved across all of our lines of business during the period through this improvement accelerated after the september  terrorist attack and highly publicized corporate governance failures and continued throughout with significant rate increases particularly evident in our diversified financial products line of business 
we have expanded our underwriting activities and increased our retentions in response to these hardening market conditions and plan to continue these actions as long as market conditions warrant 
during the period through  we acquired the following companies in transactions that were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows of these companies are included in our operations beginning on the effective date of each transaction

we anticipate continued revenue growth in net earned premium grew to million in  primarily due to increased rates  a reduction in ceded reinsurance  organic growth and higher renewal retentions 
fee and commission income increased to million in due to increased rates  organic growth and acquisitions made in late net investment income increased to million in due to higher investment assets  which increased to billion in as a result of increased loss reserves due to higher retentions and growth in lines of business where losses take longer to settle  as well as significant cash flow from operations 
net investment income increased despite lower yields on our short duration  high quality investment portfolio of fixed income securities and on our short term investments 
we expect investment assets to continue to increase and produce additional growth in investment income in  even if interest rates do not increase significantly 
if market interest rates were to rise  the growth in investment income would be accelerated as our current portfolio has a relatively short duration and would be available to be invested on a longer term basis to take advantage of higher rates 
our weighted average tax equivalent yield was in compared to in the weighted average duration of our fixed income portfolio was years and the weighted average maturity was years 
other operating income increased to million in  principally due to increased gains on our portfolio of insurance related trading securities and income from a real estate partnership that was first included in our consolidated financial statements in compensation expense increased to million during from million in subsidiaries acquired during the past year accounted for the majority of the increase  with the remaining amount primarily due to larger incentive based compensation accruals as a result of increased earnings 
other operating expense increased to million during compared to million in the reasons for this increase are as follows increase decrease subsidiaries acquired in and   guaranty fund and other special assessments    provision to increase reserve for reinsurance recoverables    foreign currency gains    other   the guaranty fund and other assessments that our insurance companies incurred in were higher than normal due to one particular state assessment and assessments in a line of business that has been discontinued 
the foreign currency gains included a gain of million in from the settlement of an advance of funds to an unaffiliated entity 
the income tax provision related to continuing operations was million for compared to million in the effective tax rate was in compared to in the increased rate results from higher expenses  which are not deductible for tax purposes and higher state income taxes 
the tax rate on the gain on the sale of our discontinued operations is higher than the statutory rate due to non deductible goodwill of million  which was included in the cost of the discontinued operations sold 
we sold our retail brokerage operation  hcc employee benefits  inc  in december  the net earnings of hcc employee benefits  inc and the gain on its sale have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings 
consistent with this presentation  all revenue and expense of hcc employee benefits  inc have been reclassified from continuing operations in our consolidated statement of earnings 
the net cash received from the sale was utilized to acquire american contractors indemnity company  a surety company  in january  we believe that the results of operations of american contractors indemnity company will at least replace the earnings from discontinued operations 
net earnings increased to million  or per diluted share  in net earnings in includes a million net of income tax  or per share  gain on sale of a subsidiary and an million net of income tax  or per share  loss due to the discount related to a commutation 
the increase in net earnings resulted from increasing operating revenue and profits and an increase in investment income

gross written premium is expected to continue to increase in net written premium in increased to million due to our insurance companies increasing retentions together with the factors discussed above 
net earned premium also increased to million for the same reasons 
growth in net written and net earned premium is expected to continue in net loss and loss adjustment expense was million for compared to million in the net loss ratio was for compared to in our net loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency relating to prior year losses was million in compared to a redundancy of million in the deficiency for included a commutation loss of million  which represents the discount on the reinsurance recoverables commuted 
the commutation increased the net loss ratio for by 
the overall loss ratio for the continuing lines was virtually unchanged 
the net loss ratio in the aviation line of business increased due to unusually good loss experience in compared to a loss ratio in that was more in line with expectations  producing an excellent underwriting profit 
loss experience in the other specialty lines improved in as it approached its expected level 
the loss ratio in the discontinued lines of business increased in following reserve additions resulting from our ongoing review of outstanding claims and the million commutation loss recorded in the fourth quarter of  somewhat offset by a million charge recorded in the third quarter of the gross loss ratio was in compared to in our gross loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency relating to prior year losses was million in compared to a redundancy of million in during  we increased our gross losses related to prior accident years by million on certain assumed accident and health reinsurance contracts reported in our discontinued line of business due to our processing of additional information received and our continuing evaluation of reserves related to this business 
also during  we incurred a million gross loss on a large warehouse fire and reduced gross losses related to prior accident years on a discontinued aggregate program by million based on revised current information 
on this same program in  we recorded million of adverse gross development 
also  during we reduced our gross losses from the september terrorist attacks by million and our gross loss from the total oil company loss by million to its ultimate settlement amount  thereby lowering the gross loss ratio 
as all these losses were substantially reinsured  they had no material effect on our net losses or earnings

after removing the effect of the commutation loss  the combined ratios for and are virtually the same 
policy acquisition costs  which are net of reimbursement with respect to reinsurance ceded  increased to million due to higher earned premium 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs to earned premium was in compared to in the decrease in percentages is due to changes in the mix of business and spreading certain costs over a larger premium volume 
net earnings of our insurance companies increased to million for from million for due to continued favorable underwriting results on increased premium volume and despite an after tax loss of million due to a commutation 
we expect growth in earnings of this segment to continue in underwriting agencies revenue from our underwriting agencies primarily fee income increased to million in due to acquisitions made beginning in the fourth quarter of as well as organic growth in our existing underwriting agencies 
subsidiaries acquired during and accounted for an increase in segment revenue in of million when compared to periods prior to their acquisition in net earnings in this segment increased to million in for the same reasons 
we expect the underwriting agency segment to continue to grow in intermediaries revenue from our intermediaries primarily commission income increased to million in due to general market conditions and organic growth 
net earnings of our intermediaries increased to million in for the same reasons 
there was also a reduction in intergroup interest and a lower effective tax rate in compared to due to the negative effects of a tax allocation true up during the operations of hcc employee benefits  inc  which are included in the intermediary segment  were sold in december and are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of earnings 
it accounted for million and million in revenue and million and million in net earnings in and  respectively 
these segment earnings of hcc employee benefits  inc include allocated general corporate overhead expenses net of income tax of million and million  respectively  in and the remaining subsidiaries in the intermediary segment are expected to continue to grow in other operations revenue and net income of other operations increased to million and million  respectively 
most of this increase came from the million gain million net of income tax on the sale of hcc employee benefits  inc the segment also saw an increase in revenue and net income due to income from our march strategic investment in argonaut group  inc and income from our strategic investment and trading accounts 
also  segment revenue increased as a result of the initial consolidation of a real estate partnership to comply with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on strategic investments  trading activities or dispositions in any given period 
corporate the net loss of the corporate segment was million for compared to net income of million in the decrease in segment earnings between years resulted primarily from the increase in incentive compensation 
the segment results in were positively affected by inter segment income tax adjustments  additional intergroup interest charged to subsidiaries and the adjustment of certain accruals to their ultimate liabilities 
the results were positively affected by a one time currency conversion gain in the amount of million 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenue increased to million for from million in the revenue increase in the insurance company segment resulted from organic growth in our existing lines of business  the addition of our new diversified financial products line of business and increased premium retention 
the revenue in the underwriting agency segment increased due to organic growth and acquisitions made in and late  but the increase was partially offset by reduced revenue in the intermediary and other operations segments as a result of market conditions and the sale or other disposition of various operations in net investment income decreased to million for from million in this decrease was due to the reduction in interest rates  substantially offset by the higher level of invested assets which resulted from cash flow provided by operating activities and capital contributions made to our insurance company subsidiaries 
the year was adversely affected as we experienced the largest loss to our insurance company operations in our history due to the terrorist attack on september  with incurred net losses of million 
in  we also recorded a charge totaling million related to our primary workers compensation line of business and other lines of business that we decided to cease writing 
included in this charge was million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our primary workers compensation line of business 
compensation expense increased to million during from million in much of this increase was due to the underwriting agency subsidiaries acquired in and late  somewhat offset by a decrease from operations sold or otherwise disposed of during late and efficiencies gained from the consolidation of certain of our underwriting agencies into our insurance company operations 
other operating expense decreased to million during compared to million in  primarily as a result of the reduction in the amortization of goodwill  operations sold or disposed of and the goodwill impairment charge in these decreases were offset by the effect of acquisitions in and late currency conversion gains amount to million in compared to million in the income tax provision related to continuing operations was million for compared to million in our effective tax rate was in the unusually high tax rate for results from the write off related to the impairment of goodwill  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
net earnings increased to million  or per diluted share  for from million  or per diluted share  in the increase in net earnings resulted from increased revenue and an improved underwriting performance by the insurance company segment  net of a charge in related to a discontinued line of business million or per share

the increase resulted from organic growth and premium rate increases in our london market account line of business  plus our diversified financial products line of business not previously written  offset by the decrease in discontinued lines of business 
net written premium for increased to million from million in  as our insurance companies have increased their overall retentions  in addition to the effect of the changes in gross premium described above

increases in net written and net earned premiums were and  respectively  before the discontinued lines of business 
net loss and loss adjustment expense was million for compared to million in the net loss expense included million from the september terrorist attack and million from the charge for lines of business we decided to cease writing 
because of these items and generally better underwriting results in as a result of higher pricing and improved policy terms and conditions  the net loss ratio was greatly improved at for compared to in  on substantially increased earned premiums 
the loss ratios for the continuing lines  with the exception of the specialty lines  also improved for these reasons 
the loss ratio in the other specialty lines increased as a result of some adverse development on policies  which were subsequently not renewed 
during the third quarter of  we also recorded a charge in the amount of million related to certain business included in discontinued lines 
this business was acquired as part of our purchase of the centris group  inc in and was of a type that we have not historically written 
the gross loss ratio was in compared to in the gross loss ratio was high because we recorded gross losses of million due to the petrobras production platform  million due to the september terrorist attack and million due to the total oil company loss 
additionally  in  as a result of further evaluation  we reduced our gross losses from the september terrorist attack by million and reduced the gross losses from the total loss by million 
offsetting this positive gross development was million of negative development due to late reporting of an aggregate program that we no longer write 
as the adjustments related to gross losses that were substantially reinsured  there was no material net effect 
during  we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in and we had gross loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency for resulted from late reported loss information received during  primarily from assumed reinsurance business written by one of our insurance companies 
there was no material net effect on our earnings as that business was substantially reinsured 
the deficiencies and redundancies result from our continued review of our loss reserves with our actuaries and the increase or reduction of reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced

net earnings of other operations decreased to million in from million in for the same reasons 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on other operating investments or dispositions thereof in any given period 
corporate the net income of the corporate segment was million for compared to a net loss of million in this improvement resulted from lower interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables and management fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and other assets 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service and payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
variations in operating cash flows can occur due to timing differences in either the payment of claims and the collection of related recoverables or the collection of receivables and the payment of related payable amounts 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit and other security such that net balances due to us are less than the gross balances shown in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
our consolidated cash and investment portfolio increased million  or during and totaled billion as of december   of which million was cash and short term investments 
the increase in investments resulted primarily from operating cash flows 
total assets increased to billion as of december  our investment portfolio includes a high percentage of liquid investments and generates a significant amount of investment income  which serves as a source of cash flow 
the average tax equivalent yield on investments was in  compared to in the weighted average maturity of our fixed income securities is years and weighted average duration of the portfolio was years  both as of december  during  over of our fixed income securities were rated a or better by standard poor s corporation 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
on december  we filed form s with the united states securities and exchange commission  which provides a shelf registration for an aggregate of million of our securities available to be issued 
these securities may be debt securities  equity securities or a combination thereof 
on march   we sold an aggregate million principal amount of convertible notes due in in a public offering 
we pay interest on april and october of each year 
each one thousand dollar principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of our common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
holders may surrender notes for conversion into shares of our common stock if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least consecutive trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of that quarter is more than per share of the conversion price per share of our common stock 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on april   and if the holders exercise this option  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of our common stock  or in a combination thereof  although our intent is to pay in cash 
our convertible notes are due in each one thousand dollar principal amount is convertible into shares of our common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the initial conversion price is subject to change under certain conditions 
we pay interest on march and september of each year 
holders may surrender notes for conversion into shares of our common stock in any calendar quarter if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter is more than per share of the conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter 
we can redeem the notes for cash at any time on or after september  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on september     and if the holders exercise this option  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof  although our intent is to pay in cash 
our debt securities are rated a by standard poor s corporation rd of ratings 
our million revolving loan facility allows us to borrow up to the maximum amount allowed by the facility on a revolving basis until the facility expires on december  the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of our insurance companies stock and guarantees entered into by our underwriting agencies and intermediaries 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which we believe are typical for similar financing arrangements 
as of december   there were no borrowings on this facility 
we intend to replace the facility at expiration with another facility 
at december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through december  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  for draws on the letters of credit and prime less on short term cash advances 
as of december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of our subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines 
the following is a summary of our contractual cash payment obligations as of december  in thousands payments by due date total thereafter convertible notes   convertible notes   bank facility other notes payable    operating leases      total obligations      the convertible notes due are shown in the column in the above table because of the put option on september  both convertible notes have various put and redemption dates as discussed in the paragraphs above 
see notes and in notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning these obligations 
we have sold businesses in the past 
in connection with these sales  we have provided indemnifications to the buyers  which we believe are typical for transactions of this nature  based upon the type of business sold 
certain of these indemnifications have no limit 
it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount under these indemnifications as our performance under the indemnifications and our ultimate liability are based upon the occurrence of future events which may or may not occur 
we currently have a liability in the amount of million recorded for performance under one such indemnification 
this indemnification was given by a company we acquired  prior to its acquisition  in connection with a sale of one of its subsidiaries 
the principal assets of hcc insurance holdings  inc are the shares of capital stock of our insurance companies 
historically  we have not relied on dividends from our insurance companies to meet the obligations of the parent holding company  which are primarily outstanding debt and debt service obligations  dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses  but  rather  we have had sufficient cash flow from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries to meet our cash flow requirements 
the payment of dividends by our insurance companies is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries 
hcc insurance holdings  inc s two direct insurance company subsidiaries can pay an aggregate of million in dividends in without obtaining special permission from state regulatory authorities 
we have a reserve of million as of december  for potential collectibility issues and associated expenses related to reinsurance recoverables 
this includes the exposure we have with respect to disputed amounts 
while we believe that the reserve is adequate based on currently available information  conditions may change or additional information might be obtained which may result in a future change in the reserve 
we periodically review our financial exposure to the reinsurance market and the level of our reserve and continue to take actions in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to possible loss 
a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
such delays have affected  although not materially to date  the investment income of our insurance companies  but not to any extent their liquidity 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit or other security such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to collect the full amounts recoverable and  if necessary  we may seek collection through judicial or arbitral proceedings 
regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios generally lower than such guidelines 
for the year ended december   our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was 
for the year ended december   our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was 
as of december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
we believe that our operating cash flows  investments  bank facility and shelf registration on file with the united states securities and exchange commission will provide sufficient sources of liquidity and capital to meet our operating and capital needs for the foreseeable future 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation also may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
inflation can also affect interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our million bank loan fluctuates with that of the market 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the british pound sterling  the euro and the us dollar 
we constantly monitor the balance between our receivables and payables and loss reserves to mitigate the potential exposure should an imbalance be expected to exist for other than a short period of time 
for the year ended december   our gain from currency conversion was million compared to a gain of million in and a gain of million in included in the amount was a one time gain of million from the settlement of an advance of funds to an unaffiliated entity 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions when applying our accounting policies 
those of our accounting policies that we consider to be most significant and the estimates and assumptions we make in the application of those accounting policies are discussed below 
earned premium  policy acquisition costs and ceding commissions all of the property and casualty policies written by our insurance companies qualify as short duration contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
written premium  net of reinsurance  is primarily included in earnings on a pro rata basis over the lives of the related policies 
however  for certain types of business  it is recognized over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance risk provided 
policy acquisition costs  including commissions  taxes  fees and other direct costs of underwriting policies less amounts reimbursed by reinsurers  are deferred and charged or credited to earnings proportionate to the premium earned 
historical and current loss and loss adjustment expense experience and anticipated investment income are considered in determining premium deficiencies and the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
loss and loss adjustment expense our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are composed of reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses less a reduction for reinsurance recoverable related to those reserves 
reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis  except for reserves acquired in transactions recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the reserves for reported losses related to our direct business and certain reinsurance assumed are initially set by our claims personnel or independent claims adjusters hired by us and subject to our review with a goal of setting the reserves at the ultimate expected loss amount as soon as possible as information becomes available 
reserves for reported losses with respect to other reinsurance assumed are recorded based upon information supplied to us by the ceding company 
our claims personnel monitor these reinsurance assumed reserves on a current basis and audit ceding companies claims to ascertain that claims are being recorded currently and that net reserves are being set at levels that properly reflect the liability related to the claims 
our actuaries  in conjunction with our claims personnel  determine the amount of our incurred but not reported reserves as well as review the reported claim reserves for positive or adverse development 
reserves are estimates and changed conditions can cause changes in the estimates 
however  we believe that our review process is effective such that any required changes are recognized in the period of change as soon as the need for the change is evident 
reinsurance recoverables offset our gross reserves based upon the contractual terms of our reinsurance agreements 
losses in our group life and accident and health  aviation  london market accounts and other specialty lines of business are recorded and paid relatively quickly 
there is not a significant amount of long tailed liability exposure in these lines of business 
therefore  reserves can be determined and recorded with a higher degree of accuracy and significant development should not be expected with respect to losses in these lines of business 
there is some reinsurance assumed in these lines of business  but  as discussed above  we monitor the assumed reported losses closely 
losses related to our diversified financial products line of business are reported relatively quickly but can develop over time as  especially with respect to directors and officers liability business where we write excess of loss risks  reported losses which are adjusted by the primary underwriter on the risk may not initially appear to be serious but can develop and affect our excess layer over time 
we believe that we have adequately reserved for this eventuality 
our discontinued line of business contains both direct business and assumed business 
some of the losses in this line are administered by others  subject to our review 
it is possible that there can be development in the loss reserves in this line of business as the business is in run off and some of it is subject to late reporting by those administering the claims 
we monitor these reserves carefully on a current basis and believe that they are properly set based upon the information we have at this time 
we have insignificant exposure to asbestos and environment policy liabilities as we did not begin business until and the type of business we wrote contained pollution exclusions or was not of the type that subjected us to those types of risks 
the table below shows our recorded reserves as of december  in thousands by line of business compared to the high and low ends of the reserve range as determined by our reserving actuaries 
based upon our historical reserving techniques and the fact that our net reserves have historically shown positive development  except for the effects of losses on commutations  which losses represent the discount on the reinsurance recoverables commuted  we believe that there will not be any negative development in our consolidated reserves recorded low end of high end of reserves actuarial range actuarial range total net reserves    individual lines of business group life  accident and health    diversified financial products    london market accounts    aviation    other specialty lines    discontinued lines    total net reserves  the sum of the individual lines of business for the low end of the actuarial range and the high end of the actuarial range will not equal the total net reserves 
moreover  it would not be appropriate to add the ranges for each line of business to obtain a range around the total net reserves because this would not reflect the diversification effects across our various lines of business 
the diversification effects result from the fact that losses across the different lines of business are not completely correlated 
reinsurance recoverables we constantly review the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables of our insurance companies and record a reserve for potentially uncollectible reinsurance 
our estimates utilized to calculate the reserve are evaluated on a current basis but are subject to change and this could affect the level of the reserve required 
we believe  based upon periodic detail reviews of our disputed and aged recoverables  that we have sufficiently provided for potential losses that are currently evident 
fee and commission income when there is no significant future servicing obligation  fee and commission income from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries are recognized on the later of the effective date of policy  the date when the premium can be reasonably established  or the date when substantially all the services relating to the insurance placement have been rendered to the client 
profit commissions based upon the profitability of business written are recorded as revenue at the end of each accounting period based upon the respective formula calculation 
such amounts are adjusted should experience change 
when additional services are require  the service revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period 
we also record an allowance for estimated return commissions that may be required to be paid upon the early termination of policies 
proceeds from ceded reinsurance ceding commissions in excess of acquisition costs are also earned pro rata over the term of the underlying policies 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings  taxable income in carry back years and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  with the exception of the benefit of certain pre acquisition tax loss carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided 
if there is a material change in the tax laws such that the actual effective tax rate changes or the time periods within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible change  we will need to reevaluate our assumptions which could result in a change in the valuation allowance required 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize the expected cash flow approach as set forth in fasb concepts statement no 
this approach utilizes a risk free rate of interest  estimates of future cash flows and probabilities as to the occurrence of the future cash flows 
we utilize our budgets and projection of future operations based upon historical and expected industry trends to estimate our future cash flows and the probability of their occurring as projected 
based upon our last impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by a satisfactory margin 
other than temporary impairments on investments declines in the market value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other than temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed maturity investments and equity securities below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate 
for fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
our policy for equity securities is to recognize impairment losses on specific securities that have had continuous material unrealized losses for more than three consecutive quarters or less  due to market conditions or industry related events 
as of december   we had gross unrealized losses on fixed income and marketable equity securities of million of aggregate market value compared to million of aggregate market value as of december  the following table displays the gross unrealized losses and fair value of investments as of december  that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for the periods indicated dollars in thousands less than months months or more total unrealized unrealized unrealized description of securities fair value losses fair value losses fair value losses us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies   federal agency mortgage backed securities   corporate fixed income securities    municipal fixed income securities     foreign securities   other   total temporarily impaired securities      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable equity securities  credit risk on reinsurance recoverables and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not historically used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk utilizing the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including  among other things amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was billion and was million as of december  if market interest rates were to change  eg from to the fair value of our fixed income securities would change approximately million as of december  this compares to change in value of million as of december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million bank loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on this loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
as of december   we had million in debt outstanding under the bank loan 
at that debt level  the change in market interest rates would have changed interest expense by million 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under our bank loan and our and convertible notes are not subject to interest rate changes 
equity risk our portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price risk due to market changes 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities including the amounts  if any  of insurance related equity securities designated as trading securities and included in other assets as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the balances include mutual fund securities with a value of million and million  respectively  as of december  and these mutual funds are invested heavily in fixed income securities but represent marketable equity securities for reporting purposes 
if the market price of all marketable equity securities were to change by as of these dates  the fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity securities would have changed million as of december  and million as of december  foreign exchange risk the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times in thousands hypothetical hypothetical us dollar change in fair us dollar change in fair equivalent value equivalent value euro   canadian dollar   british pound sterling  the gross balances in british pound sterling as of december  are comparable to amounts of prior years
