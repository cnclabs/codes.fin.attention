table of contents and industrial companies 
we compete against five major railcar manufacturers in the north american market 
for the year ended december   we shipped approximately  railcars in north america  or approximately of total north american shipments 
our north american order backlog as of december  was approximately  railcars  or approximately of the total north american backlog as estimated by the railway supply institute  inc trinity rail gmbh is one of the leading railcar manufacturers in europe with its primary operation located in romania 
we entered the european railcar manufacturing business in with our acquisition of a large government owned romanian railcar manufacturer 
immediately after the acquisition  we initiated a multi step program designed to substantially upgrade and improve the infrastructure of the facility 
in addition  we installed new state of the art railcar manufacturing tooling and equipment and began transferring our best practices 
following our merger with thrall  which also had european facilities  we initiated a consolidation program and continued with the transferring of best practices from the combined companies 
in europe  we compete against a number of manufacturers in various countries 
for the year ended december   trinity rail gmbh shipped approximately  units 
in the european market  there is no formal collection of information pertaining to railcar shipments 
however  we believe our current european market share is approximately 
our european backlog as of december  was approximately  railcars 
we hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcar and component products

in highway safety products  we are the only full line producer of guardrails crash cushions  and other protective barriers that absorb and dissipate the force of impact in collisions between vehicles and fixed roadside objects 
we believe we are the largest highway guardrail manufacturer in the united states  based on revenues  with a comprehensive nationwide guardrail supply network 
our predominantly galvanized steel product lines use the principles of momentum transfer and kinetic energy absorption to decelerate errant vehicles 
the federal highway administration determines which products are eligible for federal funds for highway projects and has approved most of our products as acceptable permanent and construction zone highway hardware according to requirements of the national cooperation highway research program 
our crash cushions and other protective barriers include multiple proprietary products manufactured through various product license agreements with certain public and private research organizations and inventors 
we hold patents and are a licensee for certain of our guardrail and end treatment products that enhance our competitive position for these products 
we sell highway safety products in all us states  canada  and mexico 
we have also recently started to export our highway safety proprietary products to certain other countries 
we compete against several national and regional guardrail producers 
weld pipe fittings  such as caps  elbows  return bends  tees  concentric and eccentric reducers and full and reducing outlet tees  are sold primarily to pipeline  petrochemical  and non petrochemical process industries

we also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers 
competition for tank heads in recent years has been intense and has resulted in sharply reduced prices for these products 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  structural towers  and other peripheral businesses 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are in brazil  the czech republic  mexico  romania  slovakia  and the united kingdom 
sales to foreign customers  primarily in europe and mexico  represented  and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and and for the nine months ended december   respectively 
as of december    and  we had approximately   and of our long lived assets located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars and propane tank containers at our mexico facilities for export to the united states 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of such factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the backlog for the railcars are million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
substantially all of our backlog is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  the rail group has a multi year sales agreement for  new railcars per year for the next four years 
no backlog amounts for orders are included for this agreement until the type of car and price have been determined 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the backlog for the railcars were million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products through our own sales personnel operating from offices in the following states and foreign countries alabama  arkansas  arizona  connecticut  florida  illinois  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  missouri  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  vermont  utah  washington  brazil  canada  mexico  romania  slovakia and switzerland 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
except in the case of weld fittings  guardrail and standard size propane tank containers  we ordinarily fabricate our products to our customer s specifications contained in a purchase order 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar manufacturing 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels and axles 
steel is available from numerous domestic and foreign sources 
specialty components purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least three suppliers continue to produce most components 
we continually monitor supply inventory levels and sources to ensure adequate support for our production 
we maintain good relationships with our suppliers and have not experienced any significant interruptions in recent years in the supply of raw materials or specialty components 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  
table of contents shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
we have not experienced difficulty fulfilling the rest of our needs from local suppliers 
steel 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and industrial products segments is steel 
at the current time  the price of steel in the us is increasing due to several factors 
primary causes are increased demand  the significant increase in scrap prices  lack of foreign imports  reduced capacity due to consolidation and scarcity of other raw inputs 
raw inputs  especially scrap  are in tight supply due to foreign demand  primarily from china 
china is absorbing not only raw inputs but also significant amounts of global supply 
us imports are expensive and are also limited because of the weaker us dollar and the significant increase in global freight rates 
spot market pricing for plate products and hot rolled coil has shown a substantial increase over the last six months 
some of our steel suppliers have implemented surcharges based on the costs of rising steel prices 
these steel market issues are also negatively impacting the price and availability of key railcar and barge components  many of which are manufactured predominantly through the use of scrap or steel 
many of our suppliers of subassemblies and parts are smaller companies which may experience higher steel prices and limited access in times of tight supply 
also  due to consolidation and challenging industry conditions  there is only one major and two smaller us suppliers of large railroad castings for freightcars 
however  foreign sources are helping to address us market demand 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity to meet current production levels in the industry 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain or further raw material price increases would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules as we work to meet market demands 
employees 
the following table presents the breakdown of employees by business group as of december  december  business unit rail group construction products group inland barge group industrial products group railcar leasing and management services group corporate and all other as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states 
acquisitions 
we made certain acquisitions during the nine months ended december  and during fiscal year accounted for by the purchase method 
the acquired operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective dates of the acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we had six acquisitions primarily in the construction products group with a combined purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under the common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to 
table of contents modification  renewal and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities  owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and operations 
in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components 
however  for certain hazardous commodities being shipped  strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation railcar industry the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on financial conditions and operations 
inland barge industry the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the barge industry are the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on financial conditions and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 

table of contents other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

executive summary trinity industries  inc is a diversified industrial company providing a variety of products and services for the transportation  industrial and construction sectors of the marketplace 
we operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis the rail group  construction products group  inland barge group  industrial products group and railcar leasing and management services group 
we also report all other which includes our smaller peripheral businesses 
we operate in cyclical industries 
in we began to witness an increase in industrial activity and signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector  which has experienced difficult market conditions over the past several years 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
during the downturn  we implemented company wide cyclicality management processes in order to identify future demand for our products and new market opportunities 
we also assessed our manufacturing capacity and took steps to rationalize our production facilities in line with the nature and location of the demand that we perceived 
in that regard  we continued our investment in production capacity in mexico to take advantage of the lower cost manufacturing environment 
we intend to increase our investment in mexico in coming years 
the improvement in industrial and manufacturing activity that we see is reflected in an increase in new car orders for us and industry wide throughout  after several years of decline 
we ended with a significantly higher backlog in our rail group with an approximate  car increase year over year 
in addition  improvement in the rail industry was seen in our railcar leasing and management services group  where leasing revenues in increased by  fueled by sales from the lease fleet  growth in the size of the lease fleet  and improvement in fleet utilization 
global insight  an independent industry research firm  has estimated that us carload traffic will grow in  in  in each of and and in increasing rail traffic should spark another key driver of new car demand the need to improve productivity and efficiency through the replacement of older  smaller  inefficient units 
the average age of the us freight car fleet is approximately years  with older than years 
the average age of the canadian car fleet is years  with in service for over years 
the average age of the mexican car fleet is years  with of the fleet over years and over years 
we believe each of these factors will be key drivers of increased railcar sales over the next few years 
global insight has estimated railcar deliveries for the industry to increase by approximately  units in to approximately  units and has estimated deliveries for of  units in   units in   units in and  units in to help finance and manage our production and delivery of railcars  we use a captive financing subsidiary  trinity industries leasing company tilc 
tilc purchases a portion of our railcar production  financing the costs through a non recourse warehouse lending facility and refinancing those borrowings through sale leaseback and other leveraged lease or equipment trust financing transactions 
in  tilc purchases represented approximately of our north american railcar production 
however  as external demand for our railcars increases  we expect that intersegment railcar production as a percentage of our total sales will decline 
on a segment basis  our rail group recognizes revenue at the time of the intersegment sale to tilc and this revenue and the related profit is eliminated in consolidation 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and industrial products segments is steel 
at the current time  the price of steel in the us is increasing due to several factors 
primary causes are increased demand  the significant increase in scrap prices  lack of foreign imports  reduced capacity due to consolidation and scarcity of other raw inputs

trinity marine products  inc tmp  an entity within the inland barge group  together with trinity  has been named as a co defendant in six separate lawsuits filed by multiple plaintiffs on various dates 
these suits allege similar causes of action related to defects in coating materials manufactured and supplied by co defendants and coatings application workmanship by tmp 
one of the suits is seeking class certification  which if certified by the court  could potentially increase the total number of barges involved in the case 
the other five suits involve tank barges sold at an average price of approximately million  and hopper barges sold at an average price of approximately  in all of these cases  the plaintiffs seek both compensatory and punitive damages and or rescission of the barge purchase contracts 
technical experts investigating the claims have expressed the opinion that technical arguments presented by the plaintiffs in this litigation are without merit 
specific claims in one of the cases were settled in tmp is defending these cases vigorously see note in our consolidated financial statements

railcar lease revenue and management fees increased million over the prior year due to the increase in the size of the lease fleet that includes both company owned railcars and railcars we lease under operating leases 
operating profit is down due to the increased size of the fleet that we lease compared to the fleet we own 
this shift resulted from the fact that  in the march quarter of  we were building a substantial portfolio of lease railcars that were subsequently moved from owned railcars to leased railcars later in the year in a sale leaseback transaction 
the reason that leased railcars result in lower operating profit margins is that operating lease expense on the railcars we lease includes both a depreciation component and an interest component that is charged to operating expense 
for owned railcars  only a depreciation component is charged to operating expense 
selling  engineering and administrative expense also increased due to our strategy to grow both the lease fleet and the managed car fleet 
for the year  the operating profit margin declined  of which was due to pricing and utilization  due to increased maintenance expenses and due to the growth in the lease fleet and marketing expenses

off balance sheet arrangements the railcar leasing and management services group leasing group has completed a series of financing transactions 
during the nine months ended december   the leasing group completed a lease arrangement for million in railcars 
the leasing group sold the railcars to an independent trust 
the trust financed the purchase of the railcars with million in debt and million in equity provided by a large independent financial institution 
the equity participant in the trust is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the trust 
the leasing group s primary liability is its commitments on the operating leases discussed below 
an independent trustee for the trust has authority for appointment of the railcar fleet manager 
during the year ended december   the leasing group completed another transaction whereby million of railcars were sold to three separate owner trusts 
two of the trusts financed the purchase of the railcars with million in debt and million in third party equity 
the equity participants in the two trusts are the primary beneficiaries of the trusts 
the remaining trust equity was capitalized with a contribution of million from the leasing group and outside debt of million see notes and of our consolidated financial statements 
because the leasing group is currently the sole equity participant of the third trust  the leasing group is the primary beneficiary and therefore the trust is currently included in the consolidated financial statements 
when an outside equity investor purchases the equity position in the third trust  it is anticipated that the leasing group will no longer be the primary beneficiary and the third trust will no longer be consolidated 
the leasing group  through newly formed  wholly owned qualified subsidiaries  leased railcars from the trusts under operating leases with terms of years  and subleased the railcars to independent third party customers under shorter term operating leases 
these qualified subsidiaries had total assets as of december  of million and as of december  million including cash of million  of which million was collateral for the equity participant of one of the trusts  and leasing group railcars of million 
the cash other than the million and railcars are pledged to collateralize the lease obligations to the trusts and are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company

the leasing group  under the terms of the servicing and remarketing agreements  is required to endeavor  consistent with customary commercial practice as would be used by a prudent person  to maintain railcars under lease for the benefit of the trusts 
the leasing group also receives management fees under the terms of the agreements 
certain ratios and cash deposits must be maintained by the leasing group s subsidiaries in order for excess cash flow  as defined in the agreements  from the lease to third parties  to be available to trinity 
the sales of the railcars by us to the trusts were accounted for as a sale leaseback transaction 
no revenue or profit was recorded at the time of the transactions and all profit was deferred and is being amortized over the terms of the operating leases

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have recorded significant changes in inventory carrying values in recent periods due to discontinuance of product lines as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future due to current market conditions in the railcar business 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
goodwill we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based on legal factors  market conditions in the united states and europe and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue 
we base our estimates on historical warranty claims 
we also provide for specifically identified warranty 
table of contents obligations 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
insurance we are self insured for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
environmental we are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings  taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification 
however  estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us

additional factors that may affect future results 
we caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to a decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could continue to result in lower sales volumes  lower prices and or a loss of profits 
the railcar industry recently experienced a deep down cycle and operated with a minimal backlog 
if this down cycle were to return we could experience increased losses and could make plant closures  suspend production and incur related costs 
litigation claims could adversely affect our operating results 
we and our subsidiaries are currently and may from time to time be involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
in one such legal proceeding  we and our wholly owned subsidiary  trinity marine products  or tmp  have been named co defendants in six separate lawsuits filed by certain purchasers of our inland barges 
these claims assert damages arising from alleged defects in coating materials supplied by a co defendant and coatings application workmanship by tmp 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages and or rescission of the barge purchase contracts 
in one of the six cases  the plaintiff has petitioned the court for certification of a class  which if certified by the court could potentially increase the total number of barges involved in the litigation 
absent class certification in this case  the other five suits involve tank barges sold at an approximate average price of million  and hopper barges sold at an approximate average price of  in addition  as of february   two of the plaintiffs owed tmp approximately million related to contracts for barges not involved in the litigation  of which million was past due 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with one of these purchasers  pursuant to which our leasing subsidiary purchased barges leased to a barge operator under long term bareboat charter agreements for million and succeeded the purchaser as lessor 
the purchase price approximated the estimated fair market value of the operating leases and residual value of the barges 
in an unrelated claim  we filed a declaratory judgment action against purchasers of certain of our inland barges  coating manufacturers and these manufacturers insurance carriers with respect to tmp s rights and obligations regarding tank barges sold to such purchasers 
in december  these purchasers filed a reconventional demand for alleged coating defects  claiming million in actual damages and million in punitive damages 
the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper or the manufacturer of the railcar or its components 
however  for certain hazardous commodities being shipped  strict liability concepts may apply 
we have appealed a final judgment in the amount of million inclusive of fees  costs and judgment interest against transit mix concrete and materials company  inc  our wholly owned 
table of contents subsidiary  relating to an employee of an independent contractor who died following an accident that occurred while working at one of our manufacturing facilities 
we believe we are insured for liability in this case  if any  in excess of million 
we are also involved in other claims and lawsuits incidental to our current and former subsidiaries businesses 
based on information currently available to us  it is management s opinion that our ultimate liability  if any  for such claims and lawsuits  including those matters associated with our use of products manufactured by others and alleged to contain asbestos  in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
however  resolutions of claims or lawsuits by settlement or otherwise could have a significant impact on our operating results for the reporting period in which any such resolution occurs 
while we maintain reserves and liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be adequate to cover these claims or lawsuits or any future claims or lawsuits arising from our businesses  and that any such claims or lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition

increases in the price and demand for steel could adversely affect our operating results 
the principal material used by us in our railcar  inland barge and industrial products operating segments is steel 
at the current time  the price of steel in the united states is increasing due to several factors 
primary causes are the significant increase in scrap prices  increased us demand  lack of foreign imports  reduced capacity due to consolidation and scarcity of other raw inputs 
raw inputs  especially scrap  are in tight supply due to foreign demand  primarily from china 
china is absorbing not only raw inputs but also significant amounts of global supply 
us imports are also limited because of the weak us dollar and the significant increase in global freight rates 
spot market pricing for plate products and hot rolled coil has shown a substantial increase over the last six months 
some of our steel suppliers have implemented surcharges based on rising steel prices 
these steel market issues are also negatively impacting the price and availability of key railcar and barge components  many of which are manufactured predominantly through the use of scrap or steel 
many of our suppliers of subassemblies and parts are smaller companies which may experience higher steel prices and limited access in times of tight supply 
also  due to consolidation and challenging industry conditions  there are only one major and two smaller us suppliers of large railroad castings for freightcars 
while we believe we have contracts and other relationships in place sufficient to meet our current product forecasts  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain or further raw material price increases would have an impact on both our margins and production schedules as we work to meet market demands

we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with air quality and the handling and disposal of waste products  fuel products and hazardous substances 
in particular  we may incur remediation costs and other related expenses because some of our manufacturing facilities were constructed and operated before the adoption of current environmental laws and the institution of compliance practices  and some of the products that we manufacture are used to transport hazardous materials 
furthermore  although we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to environmental matters in connection with future acquisitions  we may be unable to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
environmental liabilities incurred by us  if not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification  will increase our respective costs and have a negative impact on our profitability 
we compete in highly competitive industries  which may impact our respective financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce 
table of contents our revenues  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
if our railcar leasing subsidiary s inability to obtain acceptable long term financing of its railcar lease fleet could adversely effect our operating results 
trinity industries leasing company  or tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from us 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
the warehouse facility is nonrecourse to us and to our other subsidiaries other than trinity rail leasing trust ii  or trl ii  the special purpose subsidiary of tilc that is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through august  and unless renewed would be payable in three equal installments in march  september  and march a decline in the value of the railcars securing borrowings under the warehouse facility  or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases  could adversely impact trl ii s ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time trl ii purchases railcars with short term borrowings under the warehouse facility and the time trl ii obtains permanent financing for such railcars could adversely affect our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if trl ii is unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under the warehouse facility  trinity may decide to satisfy trl ii s indebtedness under the warehouse facility or the lenders under the warehouse facility may foreclose on the portion of trl ii s lease fleet pledged to secure this facility 
as of december   there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million of additional borrowing capacity under the warehouse facility 
we may be unable to remarket leased railcars on favorable terms  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms 
our ability to remarket leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for newer models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  the degree of obsolescence of the leased railcars  prevailing market and economic conditions  including interest and inflation rates  the need for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  and volume of railcar traffic 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to remarket risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms  requiring us to remarket leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could adversely effect our operating results 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion or our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  side frames and bolsters at competitive prices 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our component part needs 
specialty components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of three suppliers continue to produce each type of component we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may adversely affect our operating results 
we use natural gas at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our tank containers to custom 
table of contents ers and to operate our plant equipment 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have fluctuated significantly 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  a prolonged armed conflict in the middle east  could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas prices or energy generally 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims 
we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products under limited warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could adversely affect our operating results 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverages expire or cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could adversely impact our respective operating results 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar design and railcar component part design  performance and manufacture used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations or duties on imports imposed by the us government and agencies or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies could affect our ability to export the railcars and propane tanks that we manufacture in mexico 
our mexican subsidiary currently purchases steel from a company operating under a judicial declaration of suspension of payments 
we had approximately million of funds on deposit  as of december   which are used along with other funds from us to purchase steel 
while our understanding of mexican law is that all funds on deposit are required to be returned to us regardless of whether or not the supplier is able to operate under the declaration of suspension of payments  the uncertainty of the legal environment in these and other areas could limit our ability to enforce our rights effectively 

table of contents because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have employment agreements with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may be unable to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials or component parts 
any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
if we fail to meet the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate  our operations could be adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on financial conditions and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupations safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible for liable in any litigation or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce our inventory carrying values  which would negatively impact our financial results 
we are required to record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have recorded reductions in inventory carrying values in recent periods due to discontinuance of product lines as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
we may be required to reduce inventory carrying values in the future due to a decline in market conditions in the railcar business  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value 
table of contents of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based on legal factors  market conditions in the united states and europe and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of currency and interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately our total debt as of december  we have hedged a portion of this exposure with interest rate swaps leaving approximately of our total debt exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and in addition  we are subject to market risk related to our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
however  the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to us
