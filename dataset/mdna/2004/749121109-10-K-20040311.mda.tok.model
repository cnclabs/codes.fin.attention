item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements at the end of this item for additional factors relating to such statements as well as for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and presentation we provide local telecommunications and related services  intralata services provided within the same lata and interlata services provided across more than one lata long distance services and wireless  data and video services within our local service area  which consists of the state region of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming 
we also provide interlata long distance services and reliable  scalable and secure broadband data  voice and video communications outside our local service area as well as globally 
we previously provided directory publishing services in our local service area 
in  we entered into contracts for the sale of our directory publishing business 
in november  we closed the sale of our directory publishing business in of the states in which we offered these services referred to as dex east 
in september  we completed the sale of the directory publishing business in the remaining states referred to as dex west 
as a consequence  the results of operations of our directory publishing business are included in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
our analysis presented below is organized in a way that provides the information required  while highlighting the information that we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
our operating revenues are generated from our wireline  wireless and other services segments 
the presentation of operating revenue includes revenue results for each of our customer channels business  consumer and wholesale for the wireline segment 
an overview of the segment results is provided in segment results below 
the segment discussion below reflects the way we reported our segment results to our chief executive officer in restatement of prior years consolidated financial statements our form k was filed in october and contains  among other things  our restated consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and in our form k  we also attempted to address comments received from the sec on our previous filings 
to date  we have not received comments from the sec regarding our restatement  the form k or the adequacy of our responses to its previous comments 
business trends our results continue to be impacted by a number of factors influencing the telecommunications industry and our local service area 
first  technology substitution and competition are expected to continue to cause additional access line losses 
we expect industry wide competitive factors to continue to impact our results and we have developed new strategies for offering complementary services such as satellite television and wireless 
second  our results continue to be impacted by regulatory responses to the competitive landscape for both our local and long distance services 
third  the weak economy in our local service area has impacted demand from both our consumer and business customers 
we believe demand for our products and services will continue to be affected because of a slow recovery in our local service area 
revenue trends historically  at least of our revenue comes from our wireline segment  which provides voice services and data and internet services 
in general  we have experienced a decline in local voice related revenue as a result of a decrease in access lines and our competitors accelerated use of une p to deliver voice services 
access lines are expected to continue decreasing primarily because of technology substitution  including wireless and cable substitution for wireline telephony  and cable modem substitution for dial up internet access lines 
une p rules  which require us to sell access to our wireline network to our competitors at wholesale rates  will continue to impact our results 
the use of une p is expected to precipitate incremental losses of retail access lines and apply downward pressure on our revenue 
we recently re entered the long distance market within our local service area  and we expect the anticipated increase in interlata long distance revenue and increases in wireless revenue to offset some of the above mentioned revenue declines 
broadband services have been expanded to allow more of our customers to convert from dial up internet connections to our dsl services 
in addition  internet related revenues continue to expand  while offsetting declines in data services have stabilized and  late in  certain data services revenue has shown signs of growth 
we have begun to experience and expect increased competitive pressure from telecommunications providers either emerging from bankruptcy protection or reorganizing their capital structure to more effectively compete against us 
as a result of these increased competitive pressures  we have been and may continue to be forced to respond with less profitable product offerings and pricing plans that allow us to retain and attract customers 
our wireless revenue has declined as a result of reduced marketing efforts  intense industry competition and the impact of the economic slowdown 
starting in late  we expanded our consumer and small business product offerings to bundle wireless services with our local voice services  broadband services  video services and long distance services 
by offering our customers a complete telecommunications solution  we may experience a decrease in the rate of our wireline access line losses 
we have redesigned our local services package to provide customers with choice and simplification 
wireless offerings are being expanded through a new arrangement with sprint 
this arrangement will enable utilization of sprint s nationwide digital wireless network to offer our customers new voice and data capabilities 
expense trends our expenses continue to be impacted by shifting demand due to increased competition and the expansion of our product offerings 
expenses associated with our new product offerings tend to be more variable in nature 
while existing products tend to rely upon our embedded cost structure  the mix of products we expect to sell  combined with regulatory and market pricing stresses  may pressure operating margins 
facility costs are third party telecommunications expenses we incur to connect customers to networks or to end user product platforms not owned by us 
as revenue decreases  associated facilities costs are not always reduced at the same rate as those revenue declines 
in order to improve operational efficiencies  and in response to continued declines in revenue  we have implemented restructuring plans in which we reduced the number of our employees and consolidated and subleased idle real estate properties 
we have also reduced capital expenditures and expect to continue at this reduced level for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to evaluate our staffing levels and cost structure and adjust these areas as deemed necessary 
results of operations overview our operating revenues are generated within our segments wireline  wireless and other services 
our wireline segment includes revenue from the provision of voice services and data and internet services 
within each of the revenue categories described below  we present the customer channel from which the revenue was earned consumer  business or wholesale 
certain prior year revenue amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentations 
depending on the product or service purchased  a customer may pay an up front fee  a monthly fee  a usage charge or a combination of these 
the following is a description of the sources of our revenue voice services 
voice services revenue includes local voice services  long distance voice services and access services 
local voice services revenue includes revenue from basic local exchange services  switching services  custom calling features  enhanced voice services  operator services  public telephone services  collocation services and cpe 
long distance voice services revenue includes revenue from interlata and intralata long distance services 
access services revenue includes fees charged to other long distance providers to connect to our network 
data and internet services 
data and internet services revenue includes data services such as traditional private lines  wholesale private lines  frame relay  isdn  atm and related cpe and internet services such as dsl  dia  vpn  internet dial access  web hosting  professional services and related cpe 
wireless services 
our wireless services are provided primarily through our wholly owned subsidiary  qwest wireless 
we offer wireless services to residential and business customers  providing them the ability to use the same telephone number for their wireless phone as for their home or business phone 
in august  qwest wireless entered into a services agreement with a subsidiary of sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  including access to sprint s nationwide pcs wireless network  to consumer and business customers  primarily within our local service area 
we began offering these sprint services under our brand name in march other services 
other services revenue is predominantly derived from the sublease of some of our unused real estate assets  such as space in our office buildings  warehouses and other properties

voice services voice services revenue decreased million  or  in and decreased billion  or  in the voice services decreases were the result of declines in local voice  long distance  and access service revenue  as described in more detail below 
local voice local voice revenue decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in local voice revenue declines were driven by losses of access lines as we have experienced competition from both technology substitution and other telecommunications providers reselling our services by using une ps 
access lines declined by  or  in  and by  or  in in  we experienced consumer access line declines of  or  while business retail access lines decreased by  which included  lines lost due to the impact of the mci bankruptcy  or 
une ps  which are reflected in our wholesale channel  increased by  or 
the increase in une ps partially offset the loss of retail access lines  but because of the regulated pricing structure of une ps this applied downward pressure on our revenue 
in  we experienced consumer access line declines of  or  and business retail access line declines of  or  while une ps increased by  or 
we also experienced declines in sales of enhanced features and installation and repair services in the consumer channel in both and  and in the business channel in wholesale local voice revenue declined in and primarily due to reductions in demand for services such as operator assistance  pay phones  and collocation 
long distance long distance revenue decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in in  we evaluated specific long distance services sold primarily outside of our local service area 
based upon that evaluation  we de emphasized and stopped promoting certain products  including intralata long distance in the consumer and business markets and wholesale long distance  which resulted in a decline in both our and revenue 
however  in  we re entered the long distance market within our local service area and expanded our offerings to provide complementary local and long distance services 
as a result  interlata long distance revenue within our service area increased due to the addition of million new customers  partially offsetting other long distance revenue declines 
the decline was also due to downward pressure on our prices by our competitors 
access services access services revenue decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in  primarily due to the access line losses described above as well as the increase in the number of customers using our local service area long distance services 
in  we recorded a reserve  through reduction of revenue  of million for anticipated customer credits resulting from regulatory rulings that redefined tariffs on local calls 
the decline was also due to reduced demand caused by the bankruptcy of several large customers 
data and internet services data and internet services revenue was relatively flat in and decreased million  or  in in  revenue increases in our internet products were largely offset by declines in data services 
business channel revenue increased primarily due to increases in internet dial access and vpn 
pursuant to the amendment of our agreement with microsoft in july  we became responsible for providing broadband services to end user customers  while we previously provided related services to microsoft on a wholesale basis 
as a result  we are recognizing revenue at higher retail rates rather than the lower wholesale rates we charged microsoft 
we have also increased our dsl subscriber base by 
we have also expanded our dsl service area to of our local service area 
in addition  wholesale channel revenue declined primarily due to decreases in private data lines resulting from the bankruptcies of large customers such as touch america and mci 
in  we experienced revenue increases of million from internet products 
internet dial access revenue increased primarily from sales to large isps and businesses for use in their internal telecommunication networks  while dsl and dia grew in response to increased demand for access to the internet 
these increases were more than offset by declines of million in data services such as wholesale private line  precipitated in part by the weakened economy 
wireless revenue revenue from wireless services decreased by million  or  in and increased by million  or  in the decrease in wireless revenue in was due to our strategic decision to de emphasize marketing of wireless services on a stand alone basis coupled with tightened credit policies and intense industry competition 
although the wireless industry revenue grew in total in  our wireless revenue was relatively flat in  due in part to our limited ability to offer a competitive wireless product 
our wireless offerings  which were expanded to allow the bundling of wireless and local voice services  will be further enhanced in through our aforementioned arrangement with sprint 
other services revenue other services revenue consists primarily of sublease income from our owned and leased real estate 
other services revenue increased million  or  in and increased million  or  in through our restructuring and other efforts  we have decreased the amount of real estate we manage by million square feet  or  in and by million square feet  or  in operating expenses the following table provides further detail regarding our operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v dollars in millions operating expenses cost of sales    selling  general and administrative    depreciation    goodwill and other intangible amortization  goodwill impairment charge    nm nm asset impairment charges    nm restructuring  merger related and other charges  total operating expenses     nm not meaningful cost of sales the following table shows a breakdown of cost of sales by major component years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v dollars in millions facility costs    network costs employee and service related costs    non employee related costs  total cost of sales    cost of sales includes facility costs  network costs  salaries and wages directly attributable to products or services  benefits  materials and supplies  contracted engineering services  computer systems support and the cost of cpe sold 
cost of sales  as a percentage of revenue  was for  for and for total cost of sales increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the increase in was caused in part by the deterioration in product margins as retail access line losses were partially offset by lower margin une ps sold to our competitors at regulated rates 
margins were also adversely impacted by the settlement of certain purchase obligations 
more discussion of these changes is provided below 
facility costs increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the increase in was primarily due to a million charge resulting from the termination of our services arrangements with calpoint and another service provider 
exclusive of this one time charge  facility costs decreased million  or  as the result of reduced third party network services and declines in our out of region long distance volumes 
the decrease in was due to network optimization savings whereby we eliminated excess capacity from the network and migrated from lower speed services to more cost efficient higher speed services where applicable 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we satisfied certain fcc requirements that allowed us to begin providing in region interlata long distance using our proprietary network assets  thereby reducing our reliance on third party facility providers 
network costs include third party expenses to repair and maintain our network and supplies to provide services to customers 
our network costs were relatively flat in and decreased million  or  in in we focused on maintenance activities and experienced a slight increase in expense associated with our recent re entry in to the interlata long distance market 
additionally  the july amendment of our agreement with microsoft required that we become responsible for all costs associated with providing broadband services to end user customers 
as a result  the revenue and costs associated with this expanded service offering increased 
during  we reduced our reliance on third party contractors to provide network maintenance services by shifting this work to our employees 
we also experienced lower costs associated with wireless handset sales as a result of lower unit prices and decreases in the number of new wireless subscribers 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  commissions  overtime and third party customer service increased million  or  in and were essentially unchanged in while we have realized savings due to reductions in salaries and wages and professional fees resulting from our restructuring efforts  we continue to experience offsetting increases in costs related to our pension and post retirement benefit plans due to the change to a net expense of million in from a net credit of million in  as described more fully below 
additionally  in we experienced increased information technology costs as resources were partially shifted to system maintenance activities from development activities  which are generally capitalized 
in  we significantly reduced our employee incentive compensation 
we did not experience a similar reduction of employee incentive compensation in non employee related costs  such as real estate  cost of sales for cpe and reciprocal compensation payments decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the decrease in is attributable to lower sales of cpe equipment to customers  corresponding with lower cpe revenue  a decrease in external commissions and a decrease in reciprocal compensation 
reciprocal compensation costs  which are charges we must pay other carriers to terminate intralata local calls  declined in and due to the decline in local voice services revenue  and also as a result of regulatory action which limited the amount of charges 
the decrease in is also attributable to lower postage and shipping costs associated with improved management expense controls and lower cost of sales for data and internet cpe  associated with lower cpe revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table shows a breakdown of selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses by major component years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v dollars in millions property and other taxes bad debt employee and service related costs    non employee related costs    total sg a    sg a expenses include taxes other than income taxes  bad debt charges  salaries and wages not directly attributable to products or services  benefits  sales commissions  rent for administrative space  advertising  professional service fees and computer systems support 
total sg a decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in sg a  as a percent of revenue  was for  for and for the decreases primarily result from decreases in professional fees  bad debt expense  and other factors discussed in more detail below 
property and other taxes  such as taxes on owned or leased assets and real estate  and transactional items such as certain sales  use and excise taxes  decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the decrease in is primarily a result of reduced property taxes  which resulted from lower asset valuations related to our impairments 
the increase in our expense is attributable to higher levels of capital expansion for both the traditional telephone network and global fiber optic broadband network that took place during the years ended december  and bad debt expense decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in bad debt decreased as a percentage of revenue to for from for and for the decrease in our expense as compared to was primarily caused by large provisions associated with uncollectible receivables from mci  touch america and others which we recorded in  improved collection practices and tighter credit policies in the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to improved collections practices and tighter credit policies offset by bankruptcies of certain wholesale customers 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  sales commissions and professional fees such as telemarketing and customer service costs decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the decrease in was due to reduced salaries and wages resulting from staffing reductions implemented in and  reduced professional fees to third party vendors as we re incorporated certain previously outsourced customer service functions into our operations  and reduced sales commissions due to lower revenues and a revision to our sales compensation plan 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation and increases in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses due to the change to a net benefit expense of million in from a net credit of million in  as described more fully below 
the decrease in was due to reduced salaries and wages resulting from staffing reductions implemented in and  reduced professional fees  reduced incentive compensation and reduced sales commissions 
partially offsetting these decreases were expenses associated with the settlement of outstanding litigation and increases in our pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses 
non employee related costs  such as marketing and advertising  rent for administrative space and software expenses  were flat in and increased million  or  in our expenses declined due to lower real estate expenses and lower maintenance costs  reflecting the reduction in qwest managed real estate holdings which was partially a result of our restructuring activities 
these declines were offset by a net charge of million related to pending litigation 
the increase primarily resulted from software costs related to our re entry into the interlata long distance market  and a shift of information technology resources to maintenance activities from development activities that were eligible for capitalization 
the increase was partially offset by lower postage and shipping costs  reduced customer care costs and lower marketing and advertising expenses 
pension and post retirement benefits our results include pension credits and post retirement benefit expenses  which we refer to on a combined basis as a net pension expense or credit 
we recorded a net pension expense of million in  a net pension credit of million in and a net pension credit of million in the net pension expense or credit is a function of the amount of pension and post retirement benefits earned  interest on projected benefit obligations  amortization of costs and credits from prior benefit changes and the expected return on the assets held in the various plans 
the net pension expense or credit is allocated primarily to cost of sales and the remaining balance to sg a 
the change to a net pension expense for from a net pension credit in was due primarily to a million reduction in the expected return on plan assets  a million reduction in recognized actuarial gains resulting in a change to losses and a million increase in interest costs 
these changes are due to lower expected and actual rates of return on plan assets  lower discount rates  and increased medical costs for plan participants 
a reduction of million in the expected return on plan assets as well as a reduction of million in recognized actuarial gains  offset by lower service and interest costs of million  accounted for the decrease in the net pension credit in we expect that our net pension expense will be higher than due to a reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the effect of amortizing losses incurred in the volatile equity market of through  a lower discount rate and rising healthcare rates 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the act  became law in the united states 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  staff position fas no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we elected to defer recognition of the effects of the act in any measures of the benefit obligation or cost 
specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
currently  we do not believe we will need to amend our plan to benefit from the act 
for additional information on our pension and post retirement plans see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
also  for a discussion of the accounting treatment and assumptions regarding pension and post retirement benefits  see the discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates below 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the decrease in was primarily the result of the asset impairment charges we recorded as of june  and september  and the resulting decreases in the depreciable basis of our fixed assets as discussed below 
the decrease in was primarily the result of the june  impairment charge 
the impact of the june  impairment reduced our annual depreciation expense by approximately million  beginning july  the impact of the september  impairment further reduced our annual depreciation expense by approximately million  beginning october  these savings were partially offset by depreciation on assets acquired during and goodwill and other intangibles amortization amortization expense decreased million  or  in and decreased billion  or  in the decrease in was primarily the result of the asset impairment charge we recorded as of june   which included an impairment charge of approximately billion to other intangible assets with finite lives  reducing the amortizable basis by that amount 
the decrease in was the result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 which required us to cease amortization of indefinite lived intangible assets effective january   and the june  impairment charge 
the impact of the impairment reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately million  beginning july  the impact of the discontinuance of amortization on indefinite lived intangibles reduced our annual amortization expense by approximately billion  beginning january  goodwill impairment charges as discussed in greater detail under critical accounting policies and estimates below  on january  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we reviewed our goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives for potential impairment based on the fair value of our entire enterprise using undiscounted cash flows 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill impairments be assessed based on allocating our goodwill to reporting units and comparing the net book value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
we performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on january  based on this analysis  we recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
of billion on january  changes in market conditions  downward revisions to our projections of future operating results and other factors indicated that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill should be evaluated for impairment as of june  based on the results of that impairment analysis  we determined that the remaining goodwill balance of billion was completely impaired and we recorded an impairment charge on june  to write off the remaining balance 
asset impairment charges during  and  we recorded asset impairment charges of million  billion and million  respectively  detailed as follows years ended december  dollars in millions property  plant and equipment and internal use software  real estate assets held for sale capitalized software due to restructuring and merger activities other merger related total asset impairments  pursuant to the agreement with sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  our wireless customers who are currently being serviced through our proprietary wireless network will be transitioned onto sprint s network 
due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our own wireless network following the transition of our customers onto sprint s network  in the third quarter of we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived wireless network assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas no 
 we compared gross undiscounted cash flow projections to the carrying value of the wireless network assets and determined that the carrying value of those assets was not expected to be recovered through future projected cash flows 
we then estimated the fair value using recent selling prices for comparable assets and determined that our cell sites  switches  related tools and equipment inventory and certain information technology systems that support the wireless network were determined to be impaired by an aggregate amount of million 
the fair value of the impaired assets becomes the new basis for accounting purposes 
approximately million in accumulated depreciation was eliminated in connection with the accounting for the impairments 
the impact of the impairments is expected to reduce our annual depreciation and amortization expense by approximately million  beginning october  effective june   a general deterioration of the telecommunications market  downward revisions to our expected future results and other factors indicated that our investments in our long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for impairment analysis purposes  we grouped our property  plant and equipment and projected cash flows as follows traditional telephone network  national fiber optic broadband network  international fiber optic broadband network  wireless network  web hosting and application service provider  or asp  assets held for sale and out of region dsl 
based on the gross undiscounted cash flow projections  we determined that all of our asset groups  except our traditional telephone network  were impaired at june  for those asset groups that were impaired  we then estimated the fair value using a variety of techniques 
for the year ended december   we determined that the fair values were less than our carrying amounts by billion in the aggregate 
approximately billion in accumulated depreciation was eliminated in connection with the accounting for the impairments 
the impact of the impairments reduced our annual depreciation and amortization expense by approximately billion  beginning july  as part of our restructuring activities in  we reviewed all of our existing construction projects 
following this review  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to the abandonment of certain of the web hosting centers and other internal use construction projects 
we also recorded asset impairment charges of million in related to internal software projects that we terminated 
restructuring and merger related charges during the year ended december   as part of an ongoing effort of evaluating costs of operations  we reviewed employee levels in certain areas of our business 
as a result  we established a reserve and recorded a charge to our consolidated statement of operations for million to cover the related costs of this plan 
the activities include charges of million for severance benefits and other charges pursuant to established severance policies 
as part of this plan we identified approximately  employees from various functional areas to be terminated 
through december   approximately  of the planned reductions had been completed 
the remaining reductions will occur over the next year 
severance payments generally extend for two to months 
in addition  we established a reserve of million for real estate obligations  which primarily include estimated future net payments on abandoned operating leases 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately million 
also during  we reversed million of the and restructuring plan reserves as those plans were complete and the actual cumulative costs associated with those plans were less than had been anticipated 
in response to shortfalls in employee reductions as part of the restructuring plan as discussed below  during we identified employee reductions in several functional areas 
as a result  we established a reserve and recorded a charge to our consolidated statement of operations of million for these restructuring activities 
this reserve was comprised of million for severance costs and million for real estate exit costs 
the restructuring plan included the termination of  employees 
during we recorded an additional charge of million relative to the restructuring plan  which was associated with higher than originally anticipated real estate exit costs 
in addition  during we reversed million of severance and real estate exit related accruals relative to the restructuring plan  as actual terminations and real estate exit costs were lower than had been planned 
the plan reversal was comprised of million of severance and million of real estate exit costs 
also during the year ended december   in relation to the merger  we reversed million of reserves that were originally recorded in the reversals resulted from favorable developments relative to matters underlying the related contractual settlements 
during the fourth quarter of  a plan was approved to reduce employee levels and consolidate or abandon certain real estate locations and projects 
as a result  we established a reserve and recorded a charge to our consolidated statement of operations of million for these restructuring activities 
this reserve was comprised of million for severance costs and million for real estate exit costs 
this reserve was partially offset by a reversal of million of leased real estate related reserves 
the restructuring plan included the anticipated termination of  employees 
in relation to the merger as earlier described  during  we charged to our consolidated statement of operations million for additional contractual settlements  legal contingencies and other related costs  and million for additional severance charges  net of merger reversals 
the additional provisions and reversals of merger related costs were due to additional merger related activities and modification to the previously accrued merger related activities

interest expense was billion for  compared to billion for and billion for this decrease was primarily due to a reduction of our total outstanding debt by billion during and more specifically due to the reduction of the credit facility held by qwest services corporation  or the qsc credit facility  by million in september as a result of the timing of these repayments  there was only a minimal impact on interest expense for interest expense was billion for  compared to billion for the increase in interest expense was attributable to the issuance of new indebtedness during in march we issued billion of ten year bonds at an interest rate 
these bonds ultimately replaced short term debt  which consisted primarily of commercial paper that had a weighted average interest rate of at december  in the first quarter of  we borrowed billion from our syndicated credit facility to fund the repayment of approximately billion of outstanding commercial paper  which had a lower interest rate than the new credit facility 
our directory publishing business borrowed million in august finally  interest expense in was higher due to million decrease in capitalized interest as a result of lower capital expenditures 
losses and impairment of investment in kpnqwest 
as more fully discussed in note investments to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  we reviewed the carrying value of our investment in kpnqwest as of june  and as of december   to evaluate whether the carrying amount of our investment in kpnqwest was impaired 
in both instances we determined that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment 
as a result  we recorded an asset impairment loss of billion in our consolidated statement of operations 
in  after kpnqwest filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations  we wrote off the remaining billion of our investment 
loss gain on sale of investments and other investment write downs 
we review our portfolio of equity securities on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in value on individual securities are other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in value of an equity security is other than temporary  we record a charge in the statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value 
we recorded write downs of our investments for other than temporary declines of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our portfolio of equity securities includes a number of warrants to purchase securities in other entities 
we carry these securities at fair market value and include any gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also have owned a number of other public and private investments 
during and we recorded charges totaling million and million  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in value relating to our investments in publicly traded marketable securities 
there were no charges recorded during during and we sold various equity investments 
as a result of these sales we received approximately million and million in cash and recognized a loss of million and a loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had no significant sales of investments in qwest owned an interest in qwest digital media  llc as discussed in note investments to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting 
we recorded charges of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  representing primarily our equity share of losses in this investment 
gain loss on early retirement of debt 
on december   we completed a cash tender offer for the purchase of billion aggregate face amount of outstanding debt of qwest  qwest services corporation  or qsc  and qcf for approximately billion in cash 
as a result  we recorded a loss of million on the early retirement of this debt 
in addition  during  we exchanged million of face amount of existing qcf and qwest communications corporation  or qcc  notes for million of cash and million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
as a result  a gain of million was recorded on the early retirement of this debt 
on december   we completed an offer to exchange up to billion in aggregate principal face amount of outstanding unsecured debt securities of qcf for new unsecured debt securities of qsc 
we received valid tenders of approximately billion in total principal amount of the qcf notes and issued in exchange approximately billion in face value of new debt securities of qsc 
the majority of these debt exchanges were accounted for as debt retirements resulting in the recognition of a billion gain 
the cash flows for two of the new debt securities were not considered substantially different than the exchanged debt and therefore no gain was realized upon exchange 
for these two debt instruments  the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying amount of the exchanged debt of approximately million was recorded as a premium and is being amortized as a credit to interest expense using the effective interest method over the life of the new debt 
in march  we completed a tender offer to buy back certain outstanding debt 
in the tender offer  we repurchased approximately million in principal of the outstanding debt for billion in cash 
as a result  a loss of million was recorded on the early retirement of this debt 
other income expense net 
other income expense net  which primarily includes interest income and early contract termination income  decreased million in and increased million in interest income increased million to million in as compared to million in due to increases in our cash balances resulting from the dex proceeds 
interest income was essentially flat in as compared to included in other income expense net for were gains totaling million related to the early termination of services contracts and iru arrangements with certain customers 
under these arrangements  we received cash up front and we were recognizing revenue over the multi year terms of the related agreements 
in these cases where the customers elected to terminate the agreements prior to their contractual end and we had no continuing obligations  we recognized the remaining portion of the deferred revenue as other income as of the termination date 
income tax benefit our continuing operations effective tax benefit rate was in  in and in our effective tax benefit rate was less than the expected rate of because of an increase in beginning of year valuation allowance of million 
our effective tax benefit increased primarily because included significant non deductible impairments that were not included in our income tax benefit 
our effective tax benefit rate also decreased compared to  due to the non deductible charges we recorded related to the impairment of our goodwill  and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recorded in the second quarter of we recorded a non cash charge of billion to establish a valuation allowance against the net federal and state deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
our losses in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance beginning in under sfas no 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of the federal and state deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities 
in the future  until we generate taxable income  we do not expect to record any significant net tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations 
income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations net of tax income from discontinued operations increased million  or  in and increased billion  or  in income from discontinued operations in all years predominately relates to our directory publishing business  dex  and has been adjusted to reflect a change in the composition of our other discontinued operations 
the increase in income from discontinued operations in is primarily the result of the completion of the sale of the dex west business resulting in a gain on sale of billion billion after tax 
the increase in income from discontinued operations in is primarily the result of the completion of the sale of the dex east business resulting in a gain on sale of billion billion after tax 
segment results we report select information about operating segments  that offer similar products and services 
our three segments are wireline  wireless and other services 
until september  we operated a fourth segment  our directory publishing business which  as described in note assets held for sale including discontinued operations to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  has been classified as discontinued operations and accordingly is not presented in our segment results below 
our chief operating decision maker  or codm  regularly reviews the results of operations at a segment level to evaluate the performance of each segment and allocate capital resources based on segment income as defined below 
the wireline segment utilizes our traditional telephone and our fiber optic broadband networks to provide voice services and data and internet services to consumer and business customers 
the wireless segment  which operates a pcs wireless network  serves consumer and business customers in a select area within our local service area 
the august  services agreement with sprint will allow us to expand our wireless service by reselling access to sprint s nationwide pcs wireless network  primarily within our local service area 
the other services segment primarily contains results of sublease activities of unused real estate assets 
segment income consists of each segment s revenue and direct expenses 
segment revenue is based on the types of products and services offered as described in results of operations above 
segment expenses include employee and service related costs  facility costs  network expenses and non employee related costs such as customer support  collections and marketing 
we manage indirect administrative services costs such as finance  information technology  real estate and legal centrally  consequently  these costs are allocated to the other services segment 
our network infrastructure is designed to be scalable and flexible to handle multiple products and services 
as a result  we do not allocate network infrastructure costs  which include all engineering expense  design  repair and maintenance costs and all third party facilities costs  to individual products 
we evaluate depreciation  amortization  interest expense  interest income  and other income expense on a total company basis 
as a result  these charges are not allocated to any segment 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
 establishes standards for reporting information about restructuring activities 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   sfas no 
requires disclosure of the total amount of costs expected to be incurred in connection with these activities for each reportable segment 
the restructuring provisions for our wireline  wireless and other services segments were million  million and million  respectively 
we do not include restructuring costs in the segment results which are reviewed by our codm 
as a result  we have excluded restructuring costs from our presentation below 
for additional information on restructuring costs by segment please see note restructuring and merger related charges to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report

these factors and other items are discussed in more detail below 
facility costs increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the increase was primarily due to the termination of services contracts with calpoint and another service provider 
exclusive of this one time charge  facilities costs decreased in both and as we eliminated excess capacity that had been provided by third party vendors 
network expenses increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in in we focused on maintenance activities and experienced a slight increase in activity associated with our recent re entry in to the interlata long distance market 
in we reduced our reliance on third party vendors to provide network maintenance services  by shifting this work to our employees 
bad debt expense decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in wireline bad debt expense declined to of revenue in from of revenue in and of revenue in the decrease in bad debt expense was primarily due to improved collection practices and the provisions for bankrupt customers 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  commissions and overtime  decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in reduced headcount levels resulting from our recent restructuring activities have reduced salaries and wages in both and the reduced staffing requirements resulted from efficiently managing resources to repair and maintain our network and reduced demand for our services 
additionally  we re incorporated certain previously outsourced functions into our operations  resulting in a reduction of professional fees 
commission expense has declined due to lower revenue and the implementation of a new commission plan in the reductions were partially offset by increases in the combined benefits and post retirement plan expenses  discussed previously 
non employee related costs  such as network real estate  cost of sales for cpe and reciprocal compensation payments  decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in reciprocal compensation costs  which are charges we must pay other carriers to terminate local calls  declined in and due to the decrease in local voice services revenue 
in we experienced a decline in cpe revenue  thus precipitating reductions in our cpe costs 
in addition  we experienced reductions in our per unit cost of cpe 
in we reduced marketing and advertising efforts due to cost cutting measures  which partially offset settlement charges we recorded which related to outstanding litigation

the decline was associated with purchasing handsets at more competitive prices and lower costs associated with fewer new subscribers 
additionally  in we reduced our reliance on third party contractors to provide network maintenance services 
pursuant to the agreement with sprint  our wireless customers who are currently being serviced through our proprietary wireless network will be transitioned onto sprint s network over time 
the cost to complete the transition of our customers to sprint s network is estimated to be million  of which million had been incurred as of december  some of these costs may be capitalized 
bad debt expense decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in wireless bad debt as a percentage of revenue declined to in from in and in the decreases in bad debt expense can be attributed to lower customer acquisitions and tighter credit policies 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits  commissions  overtime  telemarketing and customer service costs  decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the reduction was primarily a result of reduced sales activity and reduced reliance on third party vendors for customer care services 
the reduction was due to reduced salaries and wages and reduced professional fees for customer care services 
non employee related costs  such as real estate and marketing and advertising expense  decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the decrease was primarily a result of lower postage and shipping costs and a decrease in the costs associated with providing wireless accessories to our customers 
the decrease resulted from lower marketing and advertising costs associated with our strategic decision to de emphasize the sale of wireless services on a stand alone basis 
other services other services revenue for a discussion of other services revenue please see results of operations operating revenue other services revenue above 
other services expense as previously noted  other services includes unallocated corporate expenses for functions such as finance  information technology  real estate  legal  marketing services and human resources  which we centrally manage

the increase in was attributable to valuations for capital expansion to local telephone and global fiber optic broadband networks that occurred during the years ended december  and real estate costs decreased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in due to reduced administrative space needs attributable to lower staffing requirements and our decision to abandon certain properties which no longer supported our business plan 
employee and service related costs  such as salaries and wages  benefits and overtime  increased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the increase was primarily due to the increase in the combined benefits and post retirement plan expenses as discussed above and increased employee incentive compensation costs 
additionally  in we incurred professional fees as part of our re entry into the interlata long distance market 
non employee related costs increased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the increase was driven by losses related to litigation  increases in marketing and advertising costs and a shift of information technology resources to maintenance activities from development activities that were eligible for capitalization 
the increase primarily resulted from software costs related to our re entry into the interlata long distance market and a shift of information technology resources to maintenance activities from development activities that were eligible for capitalization 
liquidity and capital resources near term view our working capital deficit  or the amount by which our current liabilities exceed our current assets  was billion  million and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our working capital deficit increased million in compared to and decreased by billion in compared to our working capital deficit increased during primarily due to payments on long term borrowings  which were partially funded by proceeds from sale of the dex west business 
our working capital position improved during  primarily due to refinancing of current borrowings to long term and receipt of proceeds from sale of the dex east business 
as described below  in early we refinanced a portion of our borrowings that were due in consequently  even if we are unable to access capital markets to refinance our current portion of debt  we believe that our cash on hand together with our cash flows from operations would be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the remainder of however  if we become subject to significant judgments and or settlements as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report  we may need to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
therefore  in the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
the wireline segment provides over of our total operating revenue with the balance attributed to wireless and other services segments 
accordingly  the wireline segment provides all of the consolidated cash flows from operations 
cash flows used in operations of our wireless segment are not expected to be significant in the near term 
cash flows used in operations of our other services segment are significant  however  we expect that the cash flows provided by the wireline segment will be sufficient to fund these operations in the near term 
we expect that our capital expenditures will approximate levels  with the majority being used in our wireline segment 
we continue to pursue our strategy to improve our near term liquidity and our capital structure in order to reduce financial risk 
since december   we have taken the following measures to improve our near term financial position on february   qwest issued a total of billion of notes which consisted of million in floating rate notes due in with interest at london interbank offered rates  or libor  plus  million in fixed rate notes due in with an interest rate of  and million in fixed rate notes due in with an interest rate of  also in february  qsc paid off in full the outstanding balance of million and terminated the qsc credit facility 
qsc established a new three year revolving credit facility  or the qsc credit facility  providing for million of availability 
if drawn  the qsc credit facility bears interest  at our election  at adjusted libor or a base rate  in each case plus an applicable margin 
the margin varies based on the credit ratings of the debt issued under the facility  and is currently for libor based borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
the qsc credit facility has a variable interest rate based on the credit ratings of the facility  and on february   we completed a cash tender offer for the purchase of million aggregate principal face amount of qcf s notes due in august with million in cash 
a loss of million was recorded for the early retirement of debt which will be included in results 
long term view we have historically operated with a working capital deficit as a result of our highly leveraged position 
we expect this trend to continue 
given the long term payment obligations reflected below  we believe that without significant improvement  our cash provided by operations alone will not be sufficient to meet both our anticipated capital expenditures and debt obligations 
however  we believe that cash provided by operations  combined with our current cash position and continued access to capital markets to refinance our current portion of debt  should allow us to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to our periodic need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due  we may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash such as further cost reductions or the sale of non strategic assets if cash provided by operations does not improve  if revenue and cash provided by operations continue to decline  if economic conditions do not improve or if we become subject to significant judgments and or settlements as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
therefore  in the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report

this table does not include accounts payable of million  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of billion  deferred income taxes of million and other long term liabilities of billion all of which are recorded on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
this table does not include our open purchase orders as of december  as they are primarily cancelable without penalty and  therefore  do not represent a contractual obligation 
interest expense in all years will differ due to refinancing of debt 
in february  we have refinanced long term debt 
see note subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information 
interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective as of december  purchase commitment obligations 
we have telecommunications commitments with clecs  ixcs and third party vendors that require us to make payments to purchase network services  capacity and telecommunications equipment 
these commitments generally require us to maintain minimum monthly and or annual billings  based on usage 
included in the telecommunications commitments are purchase commitments that we entered into with kmc in connection with sales of equipment to kmc 
at that time we also entered into facilities management services agreements with them 
in connection with the kmc arrangements  we also agreed to pay the monthly service fees directly to trustees that serve as paying agents on debt instruments issued by special purpose entities sponsored by kmc 
these unconditional purchase obligations require us to pay at least of the monthly service fees for the entire term of the agreements  regardless of whether kmc provides us services 
our remaining unconditional purchase obligations under this agreement were million as of december  a portion of our fiber optic broadband network includes facilities that were purchased or are leased from third parties in the form of irus 
these agreements are generally to years in length and generally include the requirement for us to pay operating and maintenance fees to a third party for the term of the agreement 
we also have various long term  non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events 
we also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing  technical and software support 
future payments under certain services contracts will vary depending on our actual usage 
in the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to use 
letters of credit and guarantees at december   we had letters of credit of approximately million and guarantees of approximately million 
contingencies we are a defendant in a number of legal actions and the subject of a number of investigations by federal and state agencies 
while we intend to defend against these matters vigorously  the ultimate outcomes of these cases are very uncertain  and we can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
for a description of these legal actions and the potential impact on our liquidity  please see legal proceedings in item of this report and the near term view and the long term view above 
historical view operating activities 
we generated cash from continuing operating activities of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in income from continuing operations of billion after adjusting for non cash items including depreciation  amortization  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and asset impairments 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the continued trend of decreasing revenues 
the annualized decrease in revenue over the last two years is attributed to increasing competition and general downturn in the economy and telecommunications industry evidenced by access line losses  pricing declines and reduction in access services revenue 
during the reduction in cash from declines in revenue was partially offset by reductions in cash outlays for operating expenditures 
the million decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in compared to was the result of lower income from continuing operations of million after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and asset impairments 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the continued trend of decreasing revenues 
also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by continuing operating activities in was the higher level of cash outlays attributed to non recurring merger and restructuring expenditures 
cash provided by continuing operating activities in was negatively impacted by the payment of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the build up in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales resulting from the merger  and an overall slowdown in receipts from customers as a result of the weak economic environment 
investing activities 
cash used in continuing investing activities was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash used in continuing investing activities in decreased million compared to primarily as a result of a million reduction in capital expenditures in partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities investments of million during cash used in continuing investing activities in decreased billion compared to primarily as a result of a billion reduction in capital expenditures in the decrease in capital expenditures was the result of our decision to reduce our expansion efforts as a result of the general economic downturn and the completion of many of our major capital projects in financing activities 
cash used provided by financing activities was billion in  million in and billion in during  we were able to obtain new debt  refinance current debt with long term debt and retire some long term debt with cash  new long term debt or stock 
at december  we were in compliance with all provisions or covenants of our borrowings 
for additional information regarding the covenants of our existing debt instruments  see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
financing activities on june   qwest corporation  or qc  entered into a senior term loan with two tranches for a total of billion principal amount of indebtedness 
the term loan consists of a billion floating rate tranche  due in  and a million fixed rate tranche  due in the term loan is unsecured and ranks equally with all of qc s current indebtedness 
the floating rate tranche is non prepayable for two years and thereafter is subject to prepayment premiums through there are no mandatory prepayment requirements 
the covenant and default terms are substantially the same as other senior qc indebtedness 
the net proceeds were used to refinance qc s debt that was due in and to fund or refinance qc s investment in telecommunications assets 
concurrently with this issuance  our obligation under the qsc credit facility was paid down by million to a balance of billion 
the floating rate tranche bears interest at libor plus with a minimum interest rate of and the fixed rate tranche bears interest at per annum

the qsc credit facility was paid in full and terminated in february as discussed above 
during  we exchanged million of existing qcf and qcc notes for million of cash and million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of million 
the trading prices of our shares at the time the exchange transactions were consummated ranged from to per share 
during  we also exchanged million of new qsc notes for million face amount of qcf notes 
the new qsc notes have interest rates ranging from to with maturities of and while the qcf notes had interest rates ranging from to 
we paid no dividends in financing activities until february  we maintained commercial paper programs to finance our short term operating cash needs 
we had a billion syndicated credit facility  or the credit facility  available to support our commercial paper program 
as a result of reduced demand for our commercial paper  in february we borrowed the full amount under the credit facility and used the proceeds to repay the billion of commercial paper outstanding and terminated our commercial paper program 
the remainder of the proceeds was used to pay maturities and capital lease obligations and to fund operations 
in march  we amended the credit facility and converted the billion balance into a one year term loan due may  with billion designated to qcf and billion designated to qc

following this repayment  the credit facility had billion outstanding as of march   all of which was allocated to qcf 
also in march  qc issued billion in bonds with a ten year maturity and an interest rate

in connection with the second amendment  we reconstituted the credit facility as a revolving credit facility with qsc as the primary borrower 
the term of this reconstituted facility  or the qsc credit facility  was extended to may the qsc credit facility contains financial reporting covenants that require delivery of annual and quarterly periodic reports 
we obtained extensions under the qsc credit facility for the delivery of certain annual and quarterly financial information 
the waivers extended the compliance date to provide certain annual and quarterly financial information to march  on february   the qsc credit facility was paid off and terminated see note subsequent events  debt related matters in item of this report 
in august  dex borrowed million under a term loan agreement  or the dex term loan  due september to fund costs in connection with the construction  installation  acquisition and improvement of telecommunications assets

the new qsc notes consist of notes due  notes due and notes due that were issued on december  we paid no dividends in financing activities in january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock from bellsouth for billion in cash 
as part of this transaction  we entered into an agreement with bellsouth under which bellsouth agreed to purchase services valued at million from us over a five year period  or the agreement 
the agreement provided that bellsouth could pay for the services with our common stock based upon share values specified in the agreement 
during the first quarter of  we received approximately  shares of our common stock valued at million from bellsouth in partial satisfaction of the million accounts receivable outstanding at december  in addition  in accordance with the agreement  we used million of the million in cash received from certain bellsouth affiliates to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the stock tendered in the first quarter of of million was recorded in treasury stock 
the million difference between i the fair value of the shares and ii the value assigned to the shares in the agreement of million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital

as a result  dividends of million were paid on common stock in credit ratings our credit ratings were lowered by moody s investor services  standard and poor s and fitch ratings on multiple occasions during the table below summarizes our ratings for the years ended december  and december  december  moody s s p fitch moody s s p fitch corporate rating na b na na b na qwest corporation ba b b ba b b qwest services corporation nr ccc nr nr ccc nr qwest communications corporation caa ccc ccc caa ccc ccc qwest capital funding  inc caa ccc ccc caa ccc ccc qwest communications international inc caa ccc ccc caa ccc ccc na not applicable nr not rated on january   moody s assigned a senior implied rating of b to qwest and a b rating to the new qwest senior notes guaranteed by qsc issued in february they also assigned a b rating to the qsc credit facility and a caa rating to the senior subordinate notes of qsc 
at the same time  moody s confirmed ratings of other entities and lowered the rating on qwest s outstanding unguaranteed senior secured notes to caa in addition  on march   s p assigned a b to the qsc credit facility 
all other ratings are still in effect and represent ratings of long term debt and loans of each entity 
with respect to moody s  a ba rating is judged to have speculative elements  meaning that the future of the issuer cannot be considered to be well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times 
issuers with caa ratings are in poor standing with moody s 
these issuers may be in default  according to moody s  or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal and interest 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
with respect to s p  any rating below bbb indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a b rating indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  but adverse business  financial or economic conditions will likely impair the issuers capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
a ccc indicates that the obligation is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and the issuer is dependent on favorable business  financial and economic conditions in order to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within the major categories 
with respect to fitch  any rating below bbb is considered speculative in nature 
a b rating is considered highly speculative  meaning that significant credit risk is present  but a limited margin of safety remains 
financial commitments are currently being met  however  capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained  favorable business and economic environment 
a ccc rating indicates default is a real possibility 
capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained  favorable business or economic developments 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within major categories 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
given our current credit ratings  as noted above  our ability to raise additional capital under acceptable terms and conditions may be negatively impacted

these policies and estimates are considered critical because they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments and estimates 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
estimates and other reserves our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as long term contracts  customer retention patterns  allowance for bad debts  depreciation  amortization  asset valuations  internal labor capitalization rates  recoverability of assets  impairment assessments  employee benefits  taxes  reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we also assess potential losses in relation to pending litigation 
if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
see item legal proceedings in this report 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements are affected 
restructuring periodically  we commit to exit certain business activities  eliminate office or facility locations and or reduce our number of employees 
the charge to record such a decision depends upon various assumptions  including future severance costs  sublease income or disposal costs  length of time on market for abandoned rented facilities  contractual termination costs and so forth 
such estimates are inherently judgmental and may change materially based upon actual experience 
the number of employees and the related estimate of severance costs for employees combined with the estimate of future losses on sublease income and disposal activity generally has the most significant impact 
due to the estimates and judgments involved in the application of each of these accounting policies  changes in our plans and these estimates and market conditions could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and related reserves revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided 
up front fees received  primarily activation fees and installation charges  as well as the associated customer acquisition costs  are deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period  generally one to ten years 
payments received in advance are deferred until the service is provided 
customer arrangements that include both equipment and services are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are separable and separate earnings processes exist  total consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the separate elements and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if separate earnings processes do not exist  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether a separate earnings process are critical accounting estimates because it requires management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  the assessment of whether a separate earnings process exists can be subjective  the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material  and the assessment of whether a separate earnings process exists may result in revenues being reported in different periods than significant portions of the related costs 
as the telecommunications market experiences greater competition and customers shift from traditional land based telephony services to mobile services  our estimated customer relationship periods will likely decrease and when customers terminate their relationship with us  we may recognize revenue that had previously been deferred under the expectation that services would be provided to that customer over a longer period 
gaap requires us to record reserves against our receivable balances based on estimates of future collections and to not record revenue for services provided or equipment sold if collectibility of the revenue is not reasonably assured 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to the establishment of reserves for uncollectible amounts in the results of operations is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about future collections  billing adjustments and unauthorized usage  and the impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates on the accounts receivable balance reported on our consolidated balance sheets and the results reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
in selecting these assumptions  we use historical trending of write offs  industry norms  regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
software capitalization internally used software  whether purchased or developed  is capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of months to five years 
in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize certain costs associated with internally developed software such as payroll costs of employees devoting time to the projects and external direct costs for materials and services 
costs associated with internally developed software to be used internally are expensed until the point at which the project has reached the development stage 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
the capitalization of software requires judgement in determining when a project has reached the development stage and the period over which we expect to benefit from the use of that software 
further  the recovery of software projects is periodically reviewed and may result in significant write offs 
pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits earned by employees during the year  as well as interest on projected benefit obligations  are accrued currently 
prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
pension and post retirement costs are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
in computing the pension and post retirement benefit costs  we must make numerous assumptions about such things as employee mortality and turnover  expected salary and wage increases  discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets and expected future cost increases 
two of these items generally have the most significant impact on the level of cost the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
annually  we set our discount rate primarily based upon the yields on high quality fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on moody s aa corporate bonds as of year end 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the trust assets 
the rate of return is determined by the investment composition of the plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset category 
the forecasts for each asset class are generated using historical information as well as an analysis of current and expected market conditions 
the expected risk and return characteristics for each asset class are reviewed annually and revised  as necessary  to reflect changes in the financial markets 
we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan  or the pension plan  for substantially all management and occupational union employees 
to compute the expected return on pension plan assets  we apply our expected rate of return to the market related value of the pension plan assets 
the market related asset value is a computed value that recognizes changes in fair value of pension plan assets over a period of time  not to exceed five years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we elected to recognize actual returns on our pension plan assets ratably over a five year period when computing our market related value of pension plan assets 
this method has the effect of reducing the annual market volatility that may be experienced from year to year 
as a result  our expected return is not significantly impacted by the actual return on pension plan assets experienced in the current year 
changes in any of the assumptions we made in computing the pension and post retirement benefit costs could have a material impact on various components that comprise these expenses 
factors to be considered include the strength or weakness of the investment markets  changes in the composition of the employee base  fluctuations in interest rates  significant employee hirings or downsizings and medical cost trends 
changes in any of these factors could impact cost of sales and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations as well as the value of the asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
if our assumed expected rate of return of for was basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the net pension expense by million 
in response to current and expected market conditions  effective january   we lowered our assumed expected long term rate on plan assets to 
if our assumed discount rate of for was basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the net expense by million 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted sfas no 
in january  which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment upon adoption on january  and at least annually thereafter 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our initial impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  the implementation involved the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  where a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below 
we estimated the fair value of each significant reporting unit based on discounted forecasts of future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions were required in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
two of the most significant assumptions underlying the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets upon our initial implementation were the cash flow forecasts and discount rates used 
in connection with the measurement we performed at the date we adopted sfas no 
january   we determined that a increase in the cash flow forecasts would have decreased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion 
in contrast  a decrease in the cash flow forecasts would have increased the transitional impairment charge by approximately billion  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately billion 
a basis point increase in the discount rate we used would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion instead of billion  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately billion 
subsequent to adoption on january  of sfas no 
 we determined that circumstances indicated that it was more likely than not that an impairment loss was incurred  and as a result  we tested the remaining goodwill for possible impairment 
our impairment analysis as of june   resulted in an impairment of the remaining goodwill of approximately billion 
as a result of recording the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for the transitional impairment of billion and the additional impairment of billion  there is no goodwill remaining on our balance sheet as of and subsequent to june  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the fair value estimates used in our june  measurement would have had no impact on the impairment recorded 
impairments of long lived assets pursuant to the services agreement with sprint that allows us to resell sprint wireless services  our wireless customers who are currently being serviced through our proprietary wireless network will be transitioned onto sprint s network 
due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our own wireless network following the transition of our customers onto sprint s network  in the third quarter of we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived wireless network assets 
we compared gross undiscounted cash flow projections to the carrying value of the long lived wireless network assets and determined that certain asset groups were not expected to be recovered through future projected cash flows 
for those asset groups that were not recoverable  we then estimated the fair value using estimates of market prices for similar assets 
cell sites  switches  related tools and equipment inventory and certain information technology systems that support the wireless network were determined to be impaired by million 
estimating the fair value of the asset groups involved significant judgment and a variety of assumptions 
comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types 
however  the market for cell sites and switches is not highly developed or liquid 
as such  our estimates of the fair value of such assets are highly subjective and the amounts we might receive from an orderly liquidation of such assets could differ by million or more from our estimates of the fair value of these assets used to record the impairment 
effective june   the general deterioration of the telecommunications market  the downward revisions to our expected future results of operations and other factors indicated that our investments in long lived assets may have been impaired at that date 
we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
for impairment analysis purposes  we grouped our property  plant and equipment and projected cash flows as follows traditional telephone network  national fiber optic broadband network  international fiber optic broadband network  wireless network  web hosting and asp  assets held for sale  and out of region dsl 
based on this assessment of recoverability  we concluded that our traditional telephone network was not impaired 
however  this analysis revealed that the remaining asset groups were impaired 
we then estimated the fair value of these asset groups and  as a result  we recorded a total of billion in asset impairment charges during the year ended december  as more fully described below 
following is a summary of impairment charges recognized by asset group for the year ended december  net of million for certain web hosting centers that have been reclassified to income from and gain on sale of discontinued operations to our consolidated statements of operations in item of this report 
asset group impairment charge fair value methodology dollars in millions national fiber optic broadband network  discounted cash flows international fiber optic broadband network comparable market data wireless network comparable market data and discounted cash flows web hosting and asp assets comparable market data assets held for sale comparable market data out of region dsl discounted cash flows total impairment charges  the national fiber optic broadband network provides long distance voice services  data and internet services  and wholesale services to business  consumer and wholesale customers outside of our local service area 
the international fiber optic broadband network provides the same services to the same types of customers only outside of the united states 
the wireless network provides pcs in select markets in our local service area 
our web hosting and asp asset group provides business customers both shared and dedicated hosting on our servers as well as application hosting services to help design and manage the customer s website and their hosting applications 
assets held for sale primarily consist of excess network supplies 
our out of region dsl assets provide dsl service to customers outside our local service area 
calculating the estimated fair value of the asset groups as listed above involves significant judgments and a variety of assumptions 
for calculating fair value based on discounted cash flows  we forecasted future operating results and future cash flows  which included long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
we also used a discount rate based on an estimate of the weighted average cost of capital for the specific asset groups as of june  comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types in third party market transactions 
relative to the above excluding the wireless network  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the estimated future cash flows of would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
also excluding wireless  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the discount rate used of basis points would have changed the impairment charge by approximately million 
in respect to the wireless assets  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the current cost factors would have changed the impairment charge by million 
also relative to the wireless assets  a hypothetical basis point change in the discount factors related to physical deterioration  functional obsolescence and economic obsolescence would have changed the impairment charge by million 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements and cumulative effect of adoption fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued in november the interpretation provides guidance on the guarantor s accounting and disclosure of guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  the accounting guidelines are applicable to certain guarantees  excluding affiliate guarantees  issued or modified after december   and require that we record a liability for the fair value of such guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs  generally referred to as asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement 
if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  the fair value of the liability shall be recognized in the period it is incurred  or if not  in the period a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this cost is initially capitalized and then amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
we have determined that we have legal asset retirement obligations associated with the removal of a limited group of long lived assets and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge upon adoption of sfas no 
of million an asset retirement obligation of million net of an incremental adjustment to the historical cost of the underlying assets of million in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we included in our group depreciation rates estimated net removal costs removal costs less salvage 
these costs have historically been reflected in the calculation of depreciation expense and therefore recognized in accumulated depreciation 
when the assets were actually retired and removal costs were expended  the net removal costs were recorded as a reduction to accumulated depreciation 
while sfas no 
requires the recognition of a liability for asset retirement obligations that are legally binding  it precludes the recognition of a liability for asset retirement obligations that are not legally binding 
therefore  upon adoption of sfas no 
 we reversed the net removal costs within accumulated depreciation for those fixed assets where the removal costs exceeded the estimated salvage value and we did not have a legal removal obligation 
this resulted in income from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million before taxes upon adoption of sfas no 
the net income impact of the adoption is million million less the million charge disclosed above  net of income taxes of million in beginning january   the net costs of removal related to these assets are charged to our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the costs are incurred 
in january and december  the fasb issued and then revised fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin no 
 which is effective immediately for all variable interest entities created after january  fin no 
must be applied for the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  for variable interest entities  or the first quarter for us 
fin no 
requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
a primary beneficiary absorbs the majority of the entity s expected losses  if they occur  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur  or both 
where it is reasonably possible that the information about our variable interest entity relationships must be disclosed or consolidated  we must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activity of the variable interest entity and the maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  we believe that it is unlikely that the adoption of fin no 
will require consolidation of any significant unconsolidated entities 
risk management we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to manage the level and volatility of our interest expense 
we may employ derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
we may also employ financial derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with particular debt 
as of december  and  approximately billion and billion  respectively  of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is linked to libor 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in libor and commercial paper rates would increase annual pre tax interest expense by million 
as of december  and  we also had approximately billion and billion of long term fixed rate debt obligations maturing in the following months 
any new debt obtained to refinance this debt would be exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in the interest rates on this debt would not have had a material effect on our earnings 
we had billion and billion of long term fixed rate debt at december  and  respectively 
a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of these instruments of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of billion and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had billion of cash invested in money market and other short term investments 
most cash investments are invested at floating rates 
as interest rates change so will the interest income derived from these accounts 
special note regarding forward looking statements this form k contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements  as that term is used in federal securities laws  about our financial condition  results of operations and business 
these statements include  among others statements concerning the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and certain transactions we have completed  such as increased revenue  decreased expenses and avoided expenses and expenditures  and statements of our expectations  beliefs  future plans and strategies  anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts 
these statements may be made expressly in this document or may be incorporated by reference to other documents we will file with the sec 
you can find many of these statements by looking for words such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  or similar expressions used in this report or incorporated by reference in this report 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by us in those statements 
some of these risks are described below under risk factors 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue 
we do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
further  the information contained in this document is a statement of our intention as of the date of this filing and is based upon  among other things  the existing regulatory environment  industry conditions  market conditions and prices  the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date 
we may change our intentions  at any time and without notice  based upon any changes in such factors  in our assumptions or otherwise 
risk factors risks affecting our business we face pressure on profit margins as a result of increasing competition  including product substitution  which could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
we compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market  and we expect competition to intensify 
we have faced greater competition in our core local business from cable companies  wireless providers including ourselves  facilities based providers using their own networks as well as those leasing parts of our network unbundled network elements  and resellers 
regulatory developments have generally increased competitive pressures on our business  such as the recent decision allowing for number portability from wireline to wireless phones 
due to these and other factors  we believe competitive telecommunications providers are no longer hindered by historical barriers to entry 
as a result  we are seeking to distinguish ourselves from our competitors through a number of customer service initiatives 
these initiatives include expanded product bundling  simplified billing  improved customer support and other ongoing measures 
however  these initiatives are new and untested 
we may not have sufficient resources to distinguish our service levels from those of our competitors  and we may not be successful in integrating our product offerings  especially products for which we act as a reseller  such as sprint s wireless services and the video services of our satellite provider partners 
even if we are successful  these initiatives may not be sufficient to offset our continuing loss of access lines 
we have also begun to experience and expect further increased competitive pressure from telecommunications providers either emerging from bankruptcy protection or reorganizing their capital structure to more effectively compete against us 
as a result of these increased competitive pressures  we have been and may continue to be forced to respond with lower profit margin product offerings and pricing schemes that allow us to retain and attract customers 
these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial performance 
continued downturn in the economy in our local service area could adversely affect our operating results 
our operations in our local service area of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming have been impacted by the continuing weakness in that region s economy 
because customers have less discretionary income  demand for second lines or additional services has declined 
this economic downturn has also led to an increased customer disconnection rate 
in addition  several of the companies with which we do business appear to be in financial difficulty or have filed for bankruptcy protection 
some of these have requested renegotiation of long term agreements with us because of their financial circumstances and because they believe the terms of these agreements are no longer appropriate for their needs 
our revenues have been and are likely to continue to be adversely affected by the loss or reduction of business with many of our customers as a result of this downturn and our continued efforts to accommodate our customers needs in this changing business environment 
rapid changes in technology and markets could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels  and any inability to respond to those changes could reduce our market share 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes  and our ability to execute on our business plans and compete depends upon our ability to develop new products and accelerate the deployment of advanced new services  such as broadband data  wireless services  video services and voip services 
the development and deployment of new products could require substantial expenditure of financial and other resources in excess of contemplated levels 
if we are not able to develop new products to keep pace with technological advances  or if such products are not widely accepted by customers  our ability to compete could be adversely affected and our market share could decline 
any inability to keep up with changes in technology and markets could also adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our ability to service our debt 
risks relating to our legal and regulatory matters any adverse outcome of investigations currently being conducted by the sec and the us attorney s office or the assessment being undertaken by the gsa could have a material adverse impact on us  on the trading price for our debt and equity securities  and on our ability to access the capital markets 
on april   the sec issued an order of investigation that made formal an informal investigation initiated on march  we are continuing in our efforts to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation 
the investigation includes  without limitation  inquiry into several specifically identified accounting practices and transactions and related disclosures that are the subject of the various adjustments and restatements described in our form k 
the investigation also includes inquiry into disclosure and other issues related to transactions between us and certain of our vendors and certain investments in the securities of those vendors by individuals associated with us 
on july   we were informed by the us attorney s office for the district of colorado of a criminal investigation of qwest 
we believe the us attorney s office is investigating various matters that include the subjects of the investigation by the sec 
while we are continuing in our efforts to cooperate fully with the sec and the us attorney s office in each of their respective investigations  we cannot predict the outcome of those investigations 
we have engaged in discussions with the sec staff in an effort to resolve the issues raised in the sec s investigation of us 
while our most recent discussions and further analysis have led us to conclude that a reserve should be provided for this matter and our securities actions see item legal proceedings in this report  such discussions are preliminary and we cannot predict the likelihood of whether those discussions will result in a settlement and  if so  the terms of such settlement 
however  settlements typically involve  among other things  the sec making claims under the federal securities laws in a complaint filed in united states district court that  for purposes of the settlement  the defendant neither admits nor denies 
were such a settlement to occur  we would expect such claims to address many of the accounting practices and transactions and related disclosures that are the subject of the various restatements we have made as well as additional transactions 
in addition  any settlement with the sec may also involve  among other things  the imposition of disgorgement and a civil penalty  the amounts of which could be materially in excess of our recorded reserve  and the entry of a court order that would require  among other things  that we and our officers and directors comply with provisions of the federal securities laws as to which there have been allegations of prior violations 
in addition  the sec has conducted an investigation concerning our earnings release for the fourth quarter and full year issued on january  the release provided pro forma normalized earnings information that excluded certain nonrecurring expense and income items resulting primarily from the merger 
on november   the sec staff informed us of its intent to recommend that the sec authorize an action against us that would allege we should have included in the earnings release a statement of our earnings in accordance with gaap 
at the date of this filing  no action has been taken by the sec 
however  we expect that if our current discussions with the staff of the sec result in a settlement  such settlement would include allegations concerning the january  earnings release 
also  the gsa is conducting a review of all contracts with us for purposes of determining present responsibility 
on september   we were informed that the inspector general of the gsa had referred to the gsa suspension debarment official the question of whether we should be considered for debarment 
we are cooperating fully with the gsa and believe that we will remain a supplier of the government  although we cannot predict the outcome of this referral 
an adverse outcome with respect to one or more of the sec investigations  the us attorney s office investigation or the gsa evaluation could have a material and significant adverse impact upon us 
further review by the sec could result in additional adjustments to our annual and quarterly reports 
we have engaged in discussions with the staff of the sec s division of corporation finance regarding our periodic filings 
they have reviewed and commented upon our form k and march form q 
as appropriate  we have attempted to address the staff s comments in our current filings and have provided responses to those other comments that we could address 
it is also possible that these comments may lead to further investigations from the sec s division of enforcement 
we may receive additional comments from the staff of the division of corporation finance and may be required to make further adjustments or additional disclosures 
while we have attempted to address all the matters identified in our internal analysis of our accounting policies  practices and procedures  due to the breadth of this analysis  the passage of time and the turnover in accounting personnel employed by us  we may have overlooked some matters in our internal analysis 
major lawsuits have been brought against us involving our accounting practices and other matters 
the outcomes of these lawsuits and other lawsuits affecting us may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
several lawsuits have been filed against us  as well as certain of our past and present officers and directors 
these lawsuits include putative class action lawsuits in which the plaintiffs allege numerous violations of securities laws 
in one of these actions  lead counsel for the plaintiffs has indicated that plaintiffs will seek damages in the tens of billions of dollars 
for a description of these legal actions  please see legal proceedings in item of this report 
the consolidated securities action  the consolidated erisa action  the calstrs  new jersey  sursi and spa actions described in legal proceedings in item of this report present material and significant risk to us 
some of the allegations in these lawsuits include many of the same subjects that the sec and us attorney s office are investigating 
the size  scope and nature of the recent restatements of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal and affect the risks presented by these matters  and we can give no assurance as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition that may ultimately result from these matters 
as we have previously disclosed  we have engaged in preliminary discussions for purposes of resolving certain of these matters 
our most recent preliminary discussions and further analysis have led us to conclude that a reserve should be provided 
accordingly  we have recorded a reserve in our consolidated financial statements for the estimated minimum liability associated with these matters 
however  the ultimate outcomes of these matters are still uncertain and there is a significant possibility that the amount of loss we ultimately incur could be substantially more than the reserve we have provided 
the securities actions are in a preliminary phase and we continue to defend against these matters vigorously 
none of the plaintiffs or the defendants in the securities actions has advanced evidence concerning possible recoverable damages and we have not yet conducted discovery on these and other relevant issues 
we are currently unable to provide any estimate as to the timing of the resolution of any of these matters 
any settlement of or judgment in one or more of these matters in excess of our recorded reserves could be significant  and we can give no assurance that we will have the resources available to pay any such judgment 
in the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
further  given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various other lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
thus  we can give no assurances as to the impacts on our financial results or financial condition as a result of these matters 
increased scrutiny of financial disclosure  particularly in the telecommunications industry in which we operate  could reduce investor confidence and affect our business opportunities 
as a result of our accounting issues and the increased scrutiny of financial disclosure  investor confidence in us has suffered and could suffer further 
congress  the sec  other government authorities and the media are intensely scrutinizing a number of financial reporting issues and practices 
in addition  as discussed earlier  the sec and the us attorney s office are currently conducting investigations including  without limitation  inquiries into several specifically identified accounting practices and transactions and related disclosures and our earnings release for the fourth quarter and full year a criminal trial of former qwest executives is taking place in the first quarter of additional civil and criminal trials could take place in the future 
evidence that is introduced at such trials may result in further scrutiny by governmental authorities and others 
the existence of this heightened scrutiny and these pending investigations could adversely affect investor confidence and cause the trading price for our securities to decline 
our form k was filed in october of and contains our restated consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and these restatements involved  among other matters  revenue recognition issues related to optical capacity asset transactions  equipment sales  directory publishing and purchase accounting and resulted in  among other things  an aggregate reduction in revenue of approximately billion 
we cannot assure you that the information in our form k or in this annual report will not be subject to change upon receipt of any such comments from the sec  and any such changes could be material 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not have to further restate earnings for prior periods as a result of any formal actions or the sec s review of our filings 
any such restatement could further impact our ability to access the capital markets and the trading price of our securities 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and are therefore exposed to restrictions on our manner of doing business and a variety of claims relating to such regulation 
our operations are subject to extensive federal regulation  including the communications act of  as amended  and fcc regulations thereunder 
we are also subject to the applicable laws and regulations of various states  including regulation by pucs and other state agencies 
federal laws and fcc regulations generally apply to interstate telecommunications including international telecommunications that originate or terminate in the united states  while state regulatory authorities generally have jurisdiction over telecommunications that originate and terminate within the same state 
generally  we must obtain and maintain certificates of authority from regulatory bodies in most states where we offer intrastate services and must obtain prior regulatory approval of rates  terms and conditions for our intrastate services in most of these jurisdictions 
our businesses are subject to numerous  and often quite detailed  requirements under federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
accordingly  we cannot ensure that we are always in compliance with all these requirements at any single point in time 
regulation of the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly  and the regulatory environment varies substantially from state to state 
all of our operations are also subject to a variety of environmental  safety  health and other governmental regulations 
there can be no assurance that future regulatory  judicial or legislative activities will not have a material adverse effect on our operations  or that domestic or international regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with regard to our compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations 
we monitor our compliance with federal  state and local regulations governing the discharge and disposal of hazardous and environmentally sensitive materials  including the emission of electromagnetic radiation 
although we believe that we are in compliance with such regulations  any such discharge  disposal or emission might expose us to claims or actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks affecting our liquidity our high debt levels  the restrictive terms of our debt instruments and the substantial litigation pending against us pose risks to our viability and may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and competitive conditions  as well as other adverse developments 
we are highly leveraged 
as of december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion 
as shown above in liquidity and capital resources payment obligations and contingencies in item of this report  a considerable amount of our debt obligations come due over the next few years 
while we currently believe we will have the financial resources to meet our obligations when they come due  we cannot anticipate what our future condition will be 
we may have unexpected costs and liabilities and we may have limited access to financing 
in addition to our periodic need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due  we may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash such as further cost reductions or the sale of non strategic assets if cash provided by operations does not improve  if revenue and cash provided by operations continue to decline  if economic conditions do not improve or if we become subject to significant judgments and or settlements as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report and in liquidity and capital resources above 
in addition  the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to investigations and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
if we fail to repay indebtedness in respect to any our indebtedness when due  or fail to comply with the financial maintenance covenants contained in the qsc credit facility  if and when drawn  the applicable creditors or their representatives could declare the entire amount owed under such indebtedness immediately due and payable 
any such event could adversely affect our ability to conduct business or access the capital markets and could adversely impact our credit ratings 
additionally  the degree to which we are leveraged may have important limiting consequences  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes may be impaired  our leverage may place us at a competitive disadvantage as compared with our less leveraged competitors  including some who have significantly reduced their debt through a bankruptcy proceeding  our leverage may make us more vulnerable to the current or future downturns in general economic conditions or in any of our businesses  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited  and our high debt levels could adversely impact our credit ratings 
we may be unable to significantly reduce the substantial capital requirements or operating expenses necessary to continue to operate our business  which may in turn affect our operating results 
we anticipate that our capital requirements relating to maintaining and routinely upgrading our network will continue to be significant in the coming years 
we also may be unable to significantly reduce the operating expenses associated with our future contractual cash obligations  including future purchase commitments  which may in turn affect our operating results 
as we will need to maintain the quality of our products and services in the future  we may be unable to further significantly reduce such capital requirements or operating expenses  even if revenues are decreasing 
such non discretionary capital outlays may lessen our ability to compete with other providers who face less significant spending requirements 
if we are unable to renegotiate a significant portion of our future purchase commitments  we may suffer related losses 
as of december   our aggregate future purchase commitments totaled approximately billion 
we entered into these commitments  which obligate us to purchase network services and capacity  hardware or advertising from other vendors  with the expectation that we would use these commitments in association with projected revenues 
we currently do not expect to generate revenues in the near term that are sufficient to offset the costs associated with some of these commitments 
although we are attempting to renegotiate and restructure certain of these contracts  there can be no assurance that we will be successful to any material degree 
if we cannot renegotiate or restructure a significant portion of these contracts on terms that are favorable to us  we will continue to have substantial ongoing expenses without sufficient revenues to offset the expenses related to these arrangements 
in addition  we may incur substantial losses in connection with these restructurings and renegotiations 
declines in the value of pension plan assets could require us to provide significant amounts of funding for our pension plan 
while we do not expect to be required to make material cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plan in the near term based upon current actuarial analyses and forecasts  a significant decline in the value of pension plan assets in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
as a result  we may be required to fund our benefit plans with cash from operations  perhaps by a material amount 
if we pursue and are involved in any business combinations  our financial condition could be affected 
on a regular and ongoing basis  we review and evaluate other businesses and opportunities for business combinations that would be strategically beneficial 
as a result  we may be involved in negotiations or discussions that  if they were to result in a transaction  could have a material effect on our financial condition including short term or long term liquidity or short term or long term results of operations 
should we make an error in judgment when identifying an acquisition candidate  or should we fail to successfully integrate acquired operations  we will likely fail to realize the benefits we intended to derive from the acquisition and may suffer other adverse consequences 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks  including incurrence of substantial transaction costs  diversion of management s attention from operating our existing business  charges to earnings in the event of any write down or write off of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions  depletion of our cash resources or incurrence of additional indebtedness to fund acquisitions  and assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including unforeseen liabilities 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions 
other risks relating to qwest if conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments  assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies  the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our critical accounting policies  which are described in this form k  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
these accounting policies are considered critical because they require judgments  assumptions and estimates that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
as a result  if future events differ significantly from the judgments  assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies or different assumptions are used in the future  such events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
taxing authorities may determine we owe additional taxes relating to various matters  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as a significant taxpayer  we are subject to frequent and regular audits from the irs  as well as from state and local tax authorities 
these audits could subject us to risk due to adverse positions that may be taken by these tax authorities 
for example  the irs has proposed a tax adjustment for tax years through the principal issue involves our allocation of costs between long term contracts with customers for the installation of conduit or fiber optic cable and additional conduit or fiber optic cable retained by us 
the irs disputes our allocation of the costs between us and third parties for whom we were building similar network assets during the same time period 
similar claims have been asserted against us with respect to and  and it is possible that claims could be made against us for other periods 
we are contesting these claims and do not believe the irs will be successful 
even if they are  we believe that any significant tax obligations will be substantially offset as a result of available net operating losses and tax sharing agreements 
however  the ultimate effect of these claims is uncertain 
because prior to qwest was a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated us federal income tax return  we could be severally liable for tax examinations and adjustments not directly applicable to current members of the qwest affiliated group 
tax sharing agreements have been executed between us and previous affiliates  and we believe the liabilities  if any  arising from adjustments to tax liability would be borne by the affiliated group member determined to have a deficiency under the terms and conditions of such agreements and applicable tax law 
we have not provided for the liability of former affiliated members in our financial statements 
as a result of the restatement of our financial results  previously filed returns and reports may be required by legal  regulatory  or administrative provisions to be amended to reflect the tax related impacts  if any  of such restatements 
where legal  regulatory or administrative rules would require or allow us to amend our previous tax filings  we intend to comply with our obligations under applicable law 
to the extent that tax authorities do not accept the tax consequences of restatement entries  liabilities for taxes could differ materially from what has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
while we believe we have adequately provided for taxes associated with these restatements  risks and contingencies  tax audits and examinations may result in liabilities that differ materially from those we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions as they expire from time to time  or if our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  our business and operating results could be materially harmed 
we are a party to collective bargaining contracts with our labor unions  which represent a significant number of our employees 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time 
if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements  if disputes with our unions arise  or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in august we reached agreements with the cwa and the ibew on new two year labor contracts 
each of these agreements was ratified by union members and expires on august  the trading price of our securities could be volatile 
in recent years  the capital markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the overall market and the trading price of our securities may fluctuate greatly 
the trading price of our securities may be significantly affected by various factors  including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  changes in investors and analysts perception of the business risks and conditions of our business  broader market fluctuations  and general economic or political conditions
