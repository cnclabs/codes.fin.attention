application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally acceptable in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements inventory valuation the company s inventories are comprised principally of goods held for resale  which are valued at the lower of cost first in first out or market 
inventories are written down to their estimated net realizable value for obsolescence  returned inventory deemed not economical to repair or discontinued product lines 
this 
table of contents estimate is based upon historical results  current inventories on hand  market conditions and current and expected sales trends 
if market conditions become less favorable than those expected by management  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the business units is determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of future cash flows and discount rates 
the determination of fair value involves estimates of future sales growth  product costs  selling and administrative costs and costs of capital 
long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  an evaluation is performed 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in the company s market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  the carrying value is compared to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  then the net book values of such assets are written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows  which includes estimating long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth  utilization of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
differences between the company s estimates and actual results would change the calculation of discounting future cash flows  which could require an impairment charge 
deferred income taxes deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for their likelihood and the amounts believed to be realizable 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets not expected to be realized 
projected future taxable income estimates are incorporated in the considerations 
significant management judgment is required in projecting future taxable income to support the realization of net deferred tax assets and any required valuation allowance 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to generate taxable income and utilize the net deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset balance 
if the company generates taxable income in future periods  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in a tax benefit in the financial statements

table of contents the company may not be profitable in the future 
the company has suffered losses in each of the last four years 
the company has significant built in costs that it needs to reduce in order to reflect the smaller size of the company after the honeywell asset sale in  as well as the possible dsg segment divestiture in additional costs related to reorganizing the company to better pursue its new strategy may adversely affect earnings in the company may incur significant operating expenses to re focus its business and can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be capable of sustaining profitable operations 
should the company need additional capital  the company may have difficulty in raising the capital 
the company does not have a significant line of credit or other loan facility in place 
the company s working capital consists of the cash remaining from the honeywell asset sale and any cash generated by a planned dsg divestment 
the company currently has no other plan nor need for additional capital from either equity or debt in the next to months 
even if the company were to seek additional equity capital  the company may not be able to locate purchasers of its equity securities to raise additional capital 
the company s technologies may not be commercially accepted in the future 
the company may not keep pace with technological advances or the company may pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted and  in either case  customers may not buy the company s products and the company s revenues may decline 
the demand for the company s products can change quickly and in ways the company may not anticipate because the company s industry is generally characterized by rapid and sometimes disruptive technological developments  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements  limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders  frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company may not be able to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any key personnel or the company s inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict the company s ability to develop new products  enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products to its customers or effectively manage the company s operations 
the common stock may be de listed from nasdaq if the stock price does not meet nasdaq s continued listing standards 
the common stock trades on the nasdaq exchange 
nasdaq has a number of continued listing requirements  including a minimum share price requirement of per share 
if the company s share price falls below per share for consecutive business days  then nasdaq could notify the company and give the company days to cure the deficiency or nasdaq could begin delisting proceedings 
those proceedings would lead to the common stock no longer trading on nasdaq 
delisting from nasdaq could result in a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in the common stock and an adverse effect on the trading price of the common stock 
delisting could also reduce the ability of holders of the common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and inexpensively as they have done historically 
this lack of liquidity could make it more difficult for the company to raise equity capital in the future 
during  the company s stock price closed below per share at the end of a number of trading sessions 

table of contents some of the company s products are not as profitable as others 
some of the company s products might require a higher level of investment in engineering and distribution 
if revenues generated from these products become a greater percentage of the company s total revenues and if the expenses associated with these products on a percentage of revenues basis do not decrease  then the company s operating margins will be reduced 
third parties may claim that the company infringes their intellectual property rights 
the company has sometimes received notices from others claiming that the company infringes their patent and intellectual property rights  and the company has been involved in litigations on patent and intellectual property rights see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
companies are more frequently seeking patent protection because of developments in the law that may extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  the company expects to receive more patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s time and attention  require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements that the company would not normally find acceptable  require the company to stop selling or to redesign products  and require the company to pay damages
