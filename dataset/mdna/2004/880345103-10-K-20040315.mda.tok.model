item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview tennant company is a world leader in designing  manufacturing and marketing products that help create a cleaner  safer world 
we provide equipment  aftermarket parts and floor coatings to contract cleaners  corporations  healthcare facilities  schools and local  state and federal governments 
we sell our products through our direct sales and service organization and a network of authorized distributors worldwide 
geographically  our customers are primarily located in north america  europe and other international markets including the middle east  asia  japan  latin america and australia 
we strive to be an innovator in our industry through our commitment to understanding our customers needs and using our expertise to create innovative solutions 
financial overview during and  and to a lesser extent during  the global industrial sector recession and lower capital spending negatively impacted our performance  and that of the industry as a whole 
while there have been some indications of an improving global economy toward the end of  the economic environment remains challenging and difficult to predict 
if the global economic conditions are weak in  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products 
north america  which generates approximately of our consolidated sales  has been impacted significantly by the industrial sector economic recession 
during  sales of equipment to the north american industrial sector stabilized  however  we saw a decline in demand in sales of equipment to the commercial sector  particularly to federal  state and local governments where the effects of the economic recession have impacted capital spending budgets 
during  our results were favorably impacted by weakness of the us dollar against the euro  the australian and canadian dollars  the british pound and the japanese yen 
we can estimate the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange on net sales and earnings  however  it is difficult to estimate the indirect financial impact 
the indirect financial impact would include such factors as the effect on sales volumes within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
for  the favorable foreign currency exchange effect on sales was approximately million 
the total direct favorable effect on earnings  which included net foreign currency transaction losses of million pre tax  was approximately million or per diluted share 
we expect that our sales and earnings will continue to be impacted by the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in if the applicable exchange rates continue to strengthen relative to the us dollar  the related effect on our results would continue to be favorable in in january  we acquired walter broadley machines limited  a cleaning equipment company based in the united kingdom  with annual sales of approximately million 
the acquisition significantly increases our customer base and service coverage in the united kingdom 
the acquisition is expected to have approximately an dilutive impact to earnings per share in  resulting primarily from certain restructuring costs  one time tax costs and a short term impact on gross profit margins related to purchase accounting 
we expect the acquisition to begin contributing to earnings in future contributions to earnings will be dependent upon our ability to successfully integrate the walter broadley business in an efficient and effective manner 
we use economic profit as a key indicator of financial performance 
economic profit is based on our net operating profit after taxes less a charge for the net assets used in the business 
the key drivers of net operating profit we focus on to improve economic profit include sales  gross margin  operating expenses  and the effective tax rate 
the key drivers we focus on to measure how effectively we utilize net assets in the business include days sales outstanding dso  days inventory on hand dioh and capital expenditures 
these key drivers are discussed in greater depth throughout management s discussion and analysis 
historical results the following compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december   and in dollars and as a percentage of net sales dollars in thousands except per share amounts net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling and administrative expenses restructuring charges pension settlement gain profit from operations other income expense profit before income taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per diluted share consolidated financial results in  net earnings increased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by a favorable foreign currency exchange impact on net earnings of approximately million or per diluted share 
growth in net sales of to million 
foreign currency exchange increased sales by approximately 
the remaining increase was due to sales growth in europe and other international markets 
recognition of previously deferred revenue totaling million as a result of the retroactive amendment to the agreement with our us third party lessor 
this increased net earnings by million or per diluted share 
the decision to dissolve our joint venture with an unrelated third party and discontinue manufacturing of the product that was the basis for the formation of the joint venture 
this resulted in a charge of million or diluted share 
a decrease in our effective tax rate to in from in primarily due to a decrease in the deferred tax charge required to establish a valuation allowance for foreign tax loss carryforwards  a more favorable mix of taxable earnings by country and a favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit 
in  net earnings increased to million or per diluted share 
net earnings were impacted by a decrease in the effective tax rate to from primarily due to a decrease in the deferred tax charge required to establish a valuation allowance for foreign tax loss carryforwards 
a decrease in selling and administrative expenses of million attributable to cost containment and reduction initiatives as well as the elimination of goodwill amortization expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill amortization in was million 
recognition of restructuring charges of million related to a workforce reduction and consolidation of our north american distribution operations  centralization of our customer service operations in europe and actions to streamline other operations in north america 
unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact on net earnings of million or per diluted share 
our financial position remained strong in our debt to total capital ratio was at december   compared with at december  cash provided by operating activities was million in  up from  while working capital increased to million 
net sales in  consolidated net sales of million increased from foreign currency exchange effects increased net sales by approximately during consolidated net sales of million in increased from million in foreign currency exchange effects  resulting primarily from the weakness of the us dollar compared to the euro  had a favorable impact of approximately on revenues in in addition  net sales for included an additional month of sales from our european operations  as discussed below 
consolidated order backlog totaled million at december  and and million at the end of our backlog represents approximately two weeks of sales 
the following table sets forth for the years indicated net sales by geography and the related percent change from the prior year dollars in thousands north america europe other international total sales north america in  north american sales of million increased compared to the sales increase is primarily due to recognition of million of previously deferred revenue  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sales growth in aftermarket parts and service contributed to the increase 
offsetting these increases were declines in equipment sales due to continued weak economic conditions in the industrial sector in north america during foreign currency exchange effects increased north american net sales approximately 
sales in north america increased in to million compared with million in sales growth in equipment of was driven by contributions from centurion  our new street sweeper product that began shipping in  and an increase in sales of equipment for commercial cleaning applications 
these contributions were partially offset by a decline in sales of equipment for industrial cleaning applications due to the continued industrial sector recession 
an increase of in aftermarket and service revenues was partially offset by a decrease in the sales of coating products 
europe european sales in were million  up compared to sales of million 
foreign currency exchange effects had a favorable impact on sales of approximately in compared to the remaining increase was primarily due to our expanded sales and service coverage in europe 
european sales of million in decreased compared to sales 
during  our european operation changed its fiscal year end from november to december because of the conversion of the european information system to the us platform 
this resulted in an additional month of sales in totaling million 
in addition  sales decreased as a result of weakness in economic conditions during foreign currency exchange effects increased european revenues approximately in other international other international sales in were million  an increase of over sales of million 
favorable foreign currency exchange effects increased sales by approximately in compared to the remaining increase in other international sales in compared with was primarily due to higher equipment sales due to strengthening economies and success selling new products in several foreign markets including asia  the middle east and australia 
other international sales in were million  a decrease of compared to sales of million 
other international sales volume decreased primarily reflecting the deterioration in global economic conditions  particularly in japan and latin america  partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange effects of approximately 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of sales in remained consistent with the write off of inventory related to the decision to dissolve a joint venture described in note to the consolidated financial statements along with unfavorable effects of sales mix were offset by favorable foreign currency exchange effects 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by in compared with the primary factor contributing to the decrease in the gross profit margin was an unfavorable sales mix resulting from the shift in sales toward lower margin equipment for commercial cleaning applications  as well as lower margins on centurion 
centurion generates lower margins because there is no mark up on the value of the chassis manufactured by our supplier 
other factors contributing to the percentage decrease in gross profit margin were a million inventory write down related to the consolidation of distribution operations  as well as unfavorable foreign exchange effects 
future gross profit margins could continue to be impacted by competitive market conditions  the mix of products both within and among product lines and geographies  and foreign currency exchange effects 
operating expenses we strive to be the industry leader in innovation and are committed to investing in research and development 
this has led to the development and launch of products such as the centurion and fast 
however  a focus on innovation also carries certain risks that new technology will be slow to be accepted by the marketplace 
management mitigates this risk through our focus on and commitment to understanding our customers needs and requirements 
research and development expenses increased million  or  in compared to  but declined as a percentage of sales in compared to research and development decreased by million  or  but remained flat as a percentage of sales in compared with we expect to continue to increase our spending on research and development at a rate that approximates our sales growth before the impact of foreign currency 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million  or in the impact of foreign currency exchange contributed approximately of the increase 
the remaining increase is primarily related to an increase in profit related employee incentives and to the dissolution of a joint venture as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined compared with in  selling and administrative expenses declined million  or 
this decrease was attributable to the favorable impact of cost reduction measures as well as general cost containment initiatives throughout the entire organization  partially offset by the effect of a settlement of a royalty obligation 
in  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points compared with on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this standard  purchased goodwill is no longer amortized over its useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to a periodic impairment test based on its fair value 
therefore  we did not recognize any goodwill amortization expense in and compared to million in restructuring charges as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges totaling million in related to a workforce reduction and consolidation of our north american distribution operations from a network of seven distribution centers into two new facilities that will be leased and managed by a third party logistics services provider and actions to consolidate and centralize customer service operations in europe and to streamline other operations in north america 
the majority of these actions were completed during and these actions improved the efficiency and productivity of our north american organization and reduced global infrastructure 
in addition  a change in estimate of million was recorded in to reduce the and restructuring charges 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in related to a workforce reduction  the closure of our germany facility and the transfer of production to a contract manufacturer in the czech republic 
these initiatives were completed in and the actions improved the efficiency and productivity of our european organization and reduced global infrastructure 
management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results 
pension settlement gain during  we recorded a million non recurring  pre tax pension settlement gain as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective rate in compared to was due to a decrease in the non cash income tax charge required to establish a valuation allowance for our future benefits from foreign tax losses of million in compared to million in  a more favorable mix of taxable earnings by country and a favorable settlement of a foreign tax audit 
the decrease in the effective rate in was the result of a decrease in the non cash income tax charge required to establish a valuation allowance for our future benefits from foreign tax losses of million in compared to million in the european tax losses resulted largely from restructuring actions taken in and for which no loss carryback is available 
in the future  we may experience changes in our effective tax rate based on our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards and changes in mix of taxable earnings by country 
during each of the past three years  we had a favorable impact from the extraterritorial income exclusion act eti act  a us tax law  of approximately on our effective tax rate 
the world trade organization has ruled the eti act is an illegal export subsidy and  as a result  the us congress may repeal the eti act in if this us law is repealed and no phase out of the tax benefit is allowed  it could result in a increase in our effective rate in liquidity and capital resources despite a continued difficult economic environment  we maintained a favorable financial position in our debt to total capital ratio was at december   compared with at december  at december   our capital structure was comprised of million of current debt  million of long term debt and million of shareholders equity 
as of december   we had available committed and uncommitted lines of credit totaling million  with terms generally one year or less  and million of related debt was outstanding 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   up from million as of december  approximately million of cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intercompany financing is used to provide working capital to subsidiaries as needed 
our current ratio was at december  and at december   based on working capital of million and million  respectively 
if the global economy remains weak during  it could have an unfavorable impact on the demand for our products and  as a result  operating cash flow 
we believe that the combination of internally generated funds  present capital resources and available financing sources are more than sufficient to meet cash requirements for our contractual cash obligations and commitments at december   are summarized in the following table in thousands total after on balance sheet obligations short term bank borrowings long term bank borrowings capital leases collateralized borrowings total on balance sheet obligations off balance sheet arrangements operating leases purchase obligations total off balance sheet obligations total contractual obligations on balance sheet obligations our long term obligations are composed primarily of a note payable due in and collateralized borrowing related to deferred sales proceeds on certain european leasing transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of operating lease commitments for office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements as well as unconditional purchase commitments 
in  we entered into a purchase commitment with a third party manufacturer totaling million through september we began a capital improvement project in to install a new powder paint system in our main manufacturing plant in minnesota 
we are committed to spend million with certain vendors for system components and installation costs over the course of the project through february our remaining purchase obligations consist of purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business 
we have a cancellation clause with our third party logistics provider which would require payment of a cancellation fee in the event we elect to cancel the agreement prior to the contract expiration date 
this fee  which approximated million at december   declines on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  which expires in in addition  in the event that we elect to cancel the agreement  we would be required to assume the underlying building lease for the remainder of its term 
we have applied the provisions of eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments above 
we sponsor defined benefit retirement plans that may require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our postretirement medical benefit plan in we do not expect that a contribution to our pension plan will be required in cash requirements operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the million increase in operating cash flows from to is primarily due to a million increase in net earnings and and million decrease in inventory levels 
inventories decreased in as a result of initiatives to reduce inventory levels companywide following the buildup that occurred in as we were transitioning inventories to locations managed by our third party logistics provider 
as discussed previously  we evaluate how effectively we utilize our net assets and monitor our operating cash flows using the dioh on a fifo basis and dso ratios 
dioh decreased by seven days to days in from days in dioh in was days 
dso decreased by one day to days in and decreased four days to days in the million decrease in operating cash flows from to is primarily attributable to a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increased sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in the increase in inventory levels is primarily due to three factors our decision to maintain duplicate parts inventories during the transition of our distribution function to a third party logistics provider  our decision to carry higher inventories in europe to respond more quickly to shorter lead time demands from customers and higher inventory levels associated with new products such as centurion 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash used in investing activities in was mainly due to capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in capital expenditures in were lower as a result of our transition to leasing versus buying for fleet vehicles 
proceeds of million in included million from the sale of an office property in the uk capital expenditures totaling million in were significantly decreased compared to the prior year as capital projects included significant investments in design systems software  new product tooling and the purchase of a previously leased production facility 
in  capital spending is expected to increase to approximately to million  subject to economic conditions 
significant capital projects planned for include investments in a powder paint system that offers cost  quality and environmental compliance benefits and an automation project in our north american service business 
expenditures for capital in are expected to be financed primarily with cash equivalents and funds from operations 
as previously discussed  we acquired all of the stock of walter broadley in january for approximately million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments as well as assuming approximately million in outstanding debt  which was immediately retired 
the cost of acquisition was paid for through funds provided by operations 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities was million in  million in and million in significant uses of cash in included a million scheduled debt repayment  million net repayments of short term borrowing  million in dividend payments  and million for net purchases of tennant common stock 
cash dividends increased for the nd consecutive year to per share in  an increase of per share over during may  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to  shares of common stock 
shares repurchased during  and approximated   and  respectively 
the average repurchase price was during  during and during at december   approximately  shares were still available for repurchase under this program 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of sales were in and in and as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we record reserves for inventory shrinkage and for potentially excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the amounts of these reserves are based upon historical loss trends  inventory levels  historical physical inventory and cycle count adjustments  expected product lives and forecasted sales demand 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements are managed according to our projected demand requirements based on market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
it is possible that increases in inventory reserves may be required in the future if there is a significant decline in demand for certain products 
alternatively  if market conditions improve  we may find it necessary to reverse a portion of these reserves 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  anticipated releases of new products and other factors 
claims experience could be materially different from actual results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
during  we recognized a change in estimate of million related to an increase in warranty claims on certain products 
warranty expense as a percentage of sales has increased from in and to in warranty expense could continue to be adversely impacted if the increased claims experience continues in as of december   we had million reserved related to future estimated warranty costs 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future tax impact of temporary differences between book and taxable income 
deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance and income tax charge are recorded when  in management s judgment  realization of a specific deferred tax asset is uncertain 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in management s expectations regarding our future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance for foreign tax loss carryforwards at december   was million

shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement  and investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this matter in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and in other written statements we make from time to time 
it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider that any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the british pound and the japanese yen against the us dollar 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change are not material 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
we are subject to exposures resulting from potential price increases of certain commodities in the purchase of raw materials or other product components 
recently  increased worldwide demand and other factors have caused prices for steel and related products to increase 
given the worldwide steel market conditions  we anticipate significant price increases in our steel based raw materials and component parts in we purchase approximately million of raw or fabricated steel annually and do not maintain an inventory of steel in excess of our near term production requirements 
we also purchase component parts that contain steel 
we will attempt to mitigate the impact of the anticipated steel price increases through product pricing and negotiations with our vendors 
successful mitigation of the impact will depend upon our ability to increase prices in a competitive market
