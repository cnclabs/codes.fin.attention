all per share data has been restated to reflect the stock dividend distributed on december  the increase in earnings is reflected in the corporation s return on average assets for return on average assets for was compared to and in and  respectively 
the growth in average shareholders equity of million for the year ended december  resulted in a slightly lower average return on equity for of compared to for return on average equity for was income tax expense for the corporation was reduced by thousand during the fourth quarter of due to the receipt of a new markets tax credit 
this credit was earned through the capitalization of community trust community development corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of community trust bank  inc the corporation was awarded a million investment allocation and the resulting tax credit through competitive application to the federal government during to stimulate economic growth in low income areas 
the corporation s assets were billion at december  and at december  the corporation experienced an increase of million in loans outstanding during as growth occurred in all three major loan categories commercial  residential real estate  and consumer loans 
total deposits of billion at december  represent a decrease of million from december  forty five million of this decrease in deposits was the result of a corporate customer electing to move their money into repurchase agreements 
additionally  as a result of the continuing low interest rate environment for deposit accounts  the corporation successfully moved million in customer deposit accounts into alternative investments through its full service brokerage operations 
the corporation also elected not to renew brokered deposits  which were acquired during previous branch acquisitions  in the amount of million 
collectively  the net decrease in deposits and repurchase agreements was million 
the corporation s liquidity is adequate with cash flows from its investment portfolio and wholesale funding sources considered available to fund its future loan growth 
charter changes effective january   the bank and the trust company converted their charters to state charters from national associations 
the bank remained a member of the federal reserve system following conversion 
following its conversion  the trust company changed its name from trust company of kentucky  national association to community trust and investment company in order to identify more closely the trust company with the bank 
while the conversions resulted in some reduction in expenses  they did not result in any changes in the management or operations of the bank or the trust company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies and the estimates required therein are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies loans loans are reported at the carrying value of unpaid principal reduced by unearned interest and an allowance for loan losses 
income is recorded on the level yield basis 
interest accrual is discontinued when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collateral value  and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
any loan greater than days past due must be well secured and in the process of collection to continue accruing interest 
cash payments received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied against principal  and interest income is only recorded once principal recovery is reasonably assured 
loans are not reclassified as accruing until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain 
nbs p  allowance for loan losses the adequacy of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management using a methodology that includes several key factors 
the corporation utilizes an internal risk grading system for commercial credits  and those larger commercial credits identified through this grading system as having weaknesses are individually reviewed for the customer s ability and potential to repay their loans 
the borrower s cash flow  adequacy of collateral held for the loan  and other options available to the corporation including legal avenues are all evaluated 
based upon this individual credit evaluation  a specific allocation to the allowance may be made for the loan 
for other commercial loans that are not individually evaluated  an allowance allocation is determined by applying an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for this group of loans 
consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
allowance allocations are provided for these pools of loans based upon an eight quarter moving average historical loss rate for each of these categories of loans 
an unallocated portion of the allowance is also determined in recognition of the inherent inability to precisely determine the loss potential in any particular loan or pool of loans 
the factors considered by management in determining this amount of inherent risk include delinquency trends  current economic conditions and trends  strength of the supervision and administration of the loan portfolio  level of nonperforming loans  trend in loan losses  recovery rates associated with previously charged off loans  concentrations within commercial credits  problem loan identification strengths and weaknesses  collateral evaluation strengths and weaknesses  and level of financial statement exceptions 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and weighted as deemed appropriate by management 
the total of these weighted factors is then applied against the total loan portfolio and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
the corporation has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses since january when it converted to an eight quarter moving average for determining historical loss rates  using specific allocations for homogenous pools of loans  and applying the inherent risk factors discussed above against the total loan portfolio instead of against the preliminary allowance calculation as was done previously 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior years that impacted the determination of the current year allowance 
investments management determines the classification of securities at purchase 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the corporation classifies securities into held to maturity or available for sale categories 
held to maturity securities are those which the corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are those the corporation may decide to sell if needed for liquidity  asset liability management  or other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
if declines in fair value are not temporary  the carrying value of the securities i s written down to fair value as a realized loss 
gains or losses on disposition of securities are computed by specific identification for all securities except for shares in mutual funds  which are computed by average cost 
interest and dividend income  adjusted by amortization of purchase premium or discount  is included in earnings 
mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated market value in the aggregate 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income 
goodwill the corporation evaluates total goodwill for impairment  based upon sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  using fair value techniques including multiples of price equity 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
effects of accounting changes goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   the corporation adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment 
the corporation evaluated total goodwill for impairment upon adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  concluding that there is no impairment as determined by evaluating goodwill using fair value techniques including multiples of price equity 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
upon adoption  the corporation ceased amortizing goodwill of approximately million arising from previous purchase transactions 
this reduced amortization expense on an annual basis by million and increased after tax earnings on an annual basis by million 
goodwill continues to be evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no

as presented in the interest rate sensitivity table in the liquidity and market risk section that is included later in the management discussion and analysis  the corporation s gap position on december  was relatively flat as the corporation had sold securities during the year and reinvested in securities with shorter maturities to offset the shortened term of its liabilities 
during  the corporation sold floating rate securities  us treasuries  and year mortgage backed securities and reinvested in agencies  municipals  and mortgage backed securities with a slightly longer duration  but with a favorable increase in the portfolio s taxable equivalent yield 
this extension of duration on the asset side of the balance sheet was the primary factor in the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity in a basis point increased rate environment declining from at decembe r  to at december  for additional information  please refer to the liquidity and market risk section below 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses that was added to the allowance was million as of december  compared to million for this provision represents a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level determined using the accounting estimates described above

foreclosed properties on december  were million  an increase from the million at december  during the fourth quarter of  the corporation was successful in obtaining title to million in real estate collateral from a problem credit that has been in foreclosure proceedings for approximately two years 
the property was recorded at cost which was lower than market value 
foreclosed properties consist primarily of family residential real estate 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  of million was a increase from the million earned during increased deposit service charge income due to the overdraft honor program implemented in september and a increase in the overdraft fee effective june  gains on sales of securities  gains on sales of loans due to increased refinancing activity  and other noninterest income contributed to the increase in noninterest income year over year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million from december  to december   securities gains increased million  gains on sales of loans increased million  and other noninterest income increased million 
as residential mortgage refinancing slowed  the corporation had a decrease in gains on sales of loans during the fourth quarter of while the increase in residential real estate loan refinancing activity  due to the low interest rate environment  resulted in higher noninterest income from the gains on sales of loans  noninterest income was negatively impacted by charges to our valuation reserve for capitalized mortgage servicing rights of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the impact to earnings per share for the years ended december  and was per share and per share  respectively 
with the slow down in residential mortgage refinancing referenced above  the corporation expects any impairment charge in to be less than prior years 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense for the year was primarily attributable to increases in legal and professional fees  operating losses  and other noninterest expense 
legal and professional fees increased million from december  to december   primarily due to fees incurred as a result of implementing the overdraft honor program  operating losses increased million  and other noninterest expense increased million  including million in nonrecurring charges to miscellaneous expense 
salaries and employee benefits remained relatively flat to prior year at million  however  this line item included million in charges in relative to the corporation s performance incentive plan 
this plan requires a performance i ncentive payment to eligible employees if the corporation reaches goals established by the board of directors 
these goals were not met in  however  if they are met in  it is anticipated the cost will be approximately million

during  the corporation sold securities and reinvested in securities with shorter maturities to offset the shortened term of its liabilities 
consequently  at december  the corporation s gap position was relatively flat 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses that was added to the allowance was million as of december  compared to million for this provision represented a charge against current earnings in order to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
loan losses  net of recoveries  as a percentage of average loans outstanding were in compared to in as net loan losses were million for compared to million for our reserve for losses on loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding increased from the of december  to at december  the increase in reserve for losses on loans from prior year was reflective of weak economic conditions 
nonperforming loans decreased from prior year 
nonperforming loans on december  were million compared to million at december  the significant decline in nonperforming loans was attributable to the payout of one commercial problem loan totaling million and the corporation s continuing focus on asset quality during a weak period in the economy 
noninterest income noninterest income for the year ended december  of million was a increase from the million earned during the same period in the increase in noninterest income for the year ended december  is primarily the result of increased deposit service charge revenue due to the implementation of our overdraft honor program  increased gains on sales of residential real estate loans due to increased refinancing activity  and increased gains on sales of securities 
while the increase in residential real estate loan refinancing activity  due to the low interest rate environment  resulted in higher noninterest income from the gains on sales of loans  noninterest income was negatively impacted by the establishment of a valuation reserve of million for the year to capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights 
noninterest expense noninterest expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in noninterest expense for the year was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel expense due to the filling of budgeted key positions within the corporation  an increase in salaries due to base salary costs associated with the acquisition of our hazard market  incentives earned by employees under our performance incentive program  and annual merit increases 
our efficiency ratio of at year end improved to at year end the deposit to fte full time equivalent ratio remained flat at million from december  to december  salaries and employee benefits in were million compared to million in occupancy expense was million in compared to million in equipment expense remained flat at million

this objective is accomplished through management of the corporation s consolidated balance sheet composition  liquidity  and interest rate risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions  interest rates  and customer preferences 
the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand or unexpected deposit withdrawals 
this is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities  maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity  and growth in core deposits 
as of december   the corporation had approximately million in securities valued at estimated fair value designated as available for sale and available to meet liquidity needs on a continuing basis 
additional asset driven liquidity is provided by the remainder of the securities portfolio and the repayment of loans 
these sources  in addition to the corporation s average equity capital base  provide a stable funding base 
in addition to core deposit funding  the corporation also accesses a variety of other short term and long term funding sources 
the corporation also relies on federal home loan bank advances for both liquidity and management of its asset liability position 
federal home loan bank advances were million at december  compared to million at december  as of december   the corporation had a million available borrowing position with the federal home loan bank 
the corporation generally relies upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activitie s  to provide cash for its investing activities 
as is typical of many financial institutions  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements  and issuance of long term debt 
at december   the corporation had a million revolving line of credit  all of which is currently available to meet any future cash needs 
the corporation s primary investing activities include purchases of securities and loan originations 
management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing consolidated balance sheet needs 
during  the corporation continued its stock repurchase program which continues to be accretive to shareholder value 
this program began in december with the authorization to acquire up to  shares and was increased by an additional  shares in july the corporation issued a press release on may  announcing its intention to repurchase up to an additional  shares 
the following table shows repurchases made through the stock repurchase program for the years through board allocation repurchases average price shares available for repurchase total management considers interest rate risk the corporation s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of the corporation s net interest revenue is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk 
the corporation employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to changing interest rates 
the model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for on and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to ch anges in interest rates are also incorporated into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  and as a result  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the corporation s asset liability management committee alco  which includes executive and senior management representatives and reports to the board of directors  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
the corporation s current exposure to interest rate risks is determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming a basis point increase or decrease in rates  spread evenly over the twelve month period 
the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the following table shows the corporation s estimated earnings sensitivity profile as of december  change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income months the simulation model used a basis point increase in the yield curve spread evenly over a twelve month period 
the measurement at december  estimates that net interest income for the corporation would increase by over one year 
a basis point immediate and sustained decrease in interest rates would decrease net interest income by over one year 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity  the corporation has developed sale procedures for several types of interest sensitive assets 
all long term  fixed rate single family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to federal home loan mortgage corporation guidelines are sold for cash upon origination 
periodically  additional assets such as commercial loans are also sold 
in and  million and million  respectively  was realized on the sale of fixed rate residential mor tgages 
management focuses its efforts on consistent net interest revenue and net interest margin growth through each of the retail and wholesale business lines 
the corporation does not currently engage in trading activities 
capital resources the corporation continues to grow its shareholders equity while also providing an average annual dividend yield during of to shareholders 
shareholders equity of million on december  is a increase from the million on december  the primary source of capital growth for the corporation is retained earnings 
cash dividends were per share for and per share for the corporation retained of its earnings in compared to in regulatory guidelines require bank holding companies  commercial banks  and savings banks to maintain certain minimum ratios and define companies as well capitalized that sufficiently exceed the minimum ratios 
the banking regulators may alter minimum capital requirements as a result of revising their internal policies and their ratings of individual institutions 
to be well capitalized banks and bank holding companies must maintain a tier leverage ratio of no less than  a tier risk based ratio of no less than  and a total risk based ratio of no less than 
the corporation s ratios as of december  were   and  respectively 
community trust bancorp  inc and it subsidiaries met the criteria for well capitalized at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
on february   the corporation issued an additional million of junior subordinated debentures to ctbi preferred capital trust ii cpctii  a wholly owned subsidiary grantor trust 
cpctii subsequently issued trust preferred securities bearing interest at an annual rate of  having a redemption date of march   and maturing on march  proceeds of million from this offering were used to pay off a revolving line of credit  million was used for payment of the redemption of senior notes on february  upon the early adoption of fin effective july   the corporation deconsolidated cpctii  as well as ctbi preferred capital trust  resulting in a recharacterization of the underlying consolidated debt obligations from the previous trust preferred securities obligations to junior subordinated debenture obligations 
under the current federal reserve board s regulatory framework  the junior subordinated debenture obligations both qualify as total capital for regulatory capital purposes 
the federal reserve board is currently evaluating whether these capital securities should continue to qualify as tier capital as a result of deconsolidating the related trust preferred securities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals 
if the federal reserve board disallows the capital securities as tier regulatory capital  the effect of such a change could have a material impact on the co rporation s regulatory ratios 
as of december   management is not aware of any current recommendations by banking regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material adverse impact on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
impact of inflation  changing prices and local economic conditions the majority of the corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
therefore  the corporation differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in non monetary assets  such as fixed assets and inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of assets in the banking industry and on the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact on financial and operating results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management seeks to maintain an essentially balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
our success is dependent on the general economic conditions of the communities we serve 
we provide financial and banking services primarily to eastern  northeast  central  and south central kentucky and southern west virginia 
the economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay loans  and the value of the collateral securing loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions will affect these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
factors influencing general conditions include inflation  recession  unemployment  and other factors beyond our control 
while the economies of a majority of the markets the corporation serves are dependent to a significant extent on the coal and coal related industries  the corporation has determined that it has successfully diversified its loa n portfolio to the extent that a significant decline in the coal or coal related industries would not have a material impact on its banking operations 
for additional information regarding concentrations of credit see note to the consolidated financial statements
