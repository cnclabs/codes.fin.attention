overview our business we design  develop and sell video content processing systems that optimize the provisioning of broadcast digital tv services across telephone company networks 
we also design  develop and sell digital video trunking systems for applications across tv broadcast  government and education facilities and private broadband network systems that enable the delivery of broadband data services over existing copper networks within hotels and private campus facilities 
our history prior to november  most of our sales were derived from our private broadband network systems 
in and we acquired three companies freegate corporation  xstreamis limited and activetelco  inc and the assets from two other companies oneworld systems  inc and viagate technologies  inc in order to expand our sales of private broadband network systems 
however  the significant downturn in the world economy in general  and the telecommunications market in particular  beginning in late had a severe and sustained adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our sales of private broadband network systems decreased substantially beginning in  which required us to take a number of restructuring efforts and incur significant impairment and other charges in order to realign our cost structure in light of the economic environment 
for the period through  we incurred an aggregate of million in intangible asset impairment charges and million in restructuring charges 
in  sales from our private broadband network systems stabilized  as we began to experience an improvement in sales of private broadband network systems to the hospitality industry 
with our november acquisition of tektronix s subsidiary vtc  we extended our product offerings to include video content processing and video trunking systems 
the acquisition of vtc resulted in significant changes in our business  including changes in our organizational structure and employee staffing  relocation of our administrative offices and a significant portion of our operations from pleasanton  california to lake oswego  oregon  the prior headquarters of vtc  an expansion of our sales and marketing efforts to include vtc products  and a reprioritization of our research and development efforts to focus on products that we acquired in our acquisition of vtc 
with our acquisition of vtc  sales of video content processing systems and digital video trunking systems now represent a majority of our total revenues and will provide most of our growth opportunities in the foreseeable future 
we earn revenue primarily by selling video content processing systems both directly and through resellers to telecommunications service providers 
we also earn revenue by selling video trunking systems to tv broadcasters  government agencies and educational institutions  and by selling private broadband network systems directly and through distributors to the hospitality industry and to owners of private multi tenant campus facilities 
prior to our acquisition of vtc  international sales represented and of our total sales in and  respectively 
since our acquisition of vtc  international sales have represented a smaller percentage of our overall business relative to prior years  though international sales are still a material portion of our total sales 
in  international sales represented of our total sales 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  and we expect that this market will continue to become more competitive in the future 
as we begin to target larger telco customers  we expect to compete with larger public companies  including harmonic  motorola and tandberg television 
our immediate competitors in the digital tv headend markets are primarily small private companies that are focused on a more narrow product line than ours and thereby may be able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing and marketing new products than we can 
in addition  these companies may become targets for acquisition by larger companies  in which case we would face competitors that would have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
definitions for discussion of results of operations our discussion of our results of operations focuses on the following items from our income statement total revenues consists of product sales  and license and royalty fees 
product revenue consists of sales of our digital tv headend  video trunking and private broadband network systems 
license and royalty fees consist of non refundable license fees and royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
since our acquisition of vtc  a large part of our quarterly revenue has been associated with the sale of digital tv headends 
furthermore  each individual headend sale has represented a significant portion of our revenue for each quarter 
if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales per quarter  our quarterly revenue would be materially impacted 
as we did not enter into any new license or royalty agreements during  or  we expect that our license and royalty revenue will decrease in the foreseeable future 
cost of goods sold cogs consists of costs related to raw materials  contract manufacturing  personnel  overhead  test and quality assurance for products  and the cost of licensed technology included in our products 
raw materials  contract manufacturing and licensed technology are the principal elements of cogs and vary directly with product sales 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of selling and marketing personnel costs  including sales commissions  travel  trade shows  promotions and outside services 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and facilities costs  contract consultants  outside testing services  and equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for administrative officers and support personnel  professional services and insurance expenses 
amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of expenses associated with the amortization of technology and patents related to prior years acquisitions 
results of operations years ended december   and our acquisition of vtc has had a significant impact on every aspect of our financial statements since november this impact is reflected in the following discussion of our operating results for fiscal year relative to and years prior to this should be considered when evaluating our period to period comparisons of relative to years prior to the following table sets forth items from our statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  total revenues cost of goods sold gross profit loss operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring costs in process research and development impairment of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations impairment of certain equity investments interest and other income  net net loss total revenues 
for the year ended december   our total revenues increased by to million from million for the year ended december  during this same period  our product revenue increased by to million from million for the year ended december  this million increase in product revenue was due to the sale of our digital tv headend and video trunking systems 
product revenue from the sale of our private broadband network systems did not contribute to the increase between and for the year ended december   our license and royalty revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our product revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  this year over year decrease of million in product revenue was primarily due to decreased sales of our private broadband network of expresso products 
for the year ended december   our license and royalty revenue decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold increased by to million from million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold increased by million between and  primarily due to costs associated with increased product sales  particularly from sales related to vtc products and due to the effects of changes in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories 
in  we reduced our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories by million because we were able to sell certain products for which we had originally set aside reserves in prior years 
these reserves were primarily related to the costs of raw materials and finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future based on the continued decline in the telecommunications market and current economic conditions 
these changes in reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold 
our gross profit improved in compared to as a result of the aforementioned factors  including increased sales 
for the year ended december   our cost of goods sold decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  this million decrease in cost of goods sold between and was primarily due to a smaller provision for excess and obsolete inventory in of million compared with a provision of million in  decreased sales of our expresso products and lower fixed manufacturing costs due to cost reductions resulting from our restructuring efforts 
the large provision for reserves in was a result of industry wide developments during and that included the write down of significant amounts of inventory by our competitors  the proliferation of lower priced competitive products resold as a result of competitors bankruptcies and write offs  a protracted slowdown in the broader telecommunications market and the indefinite postponement of capital expenditures by our customers 
sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   our sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in sales and marketing expense in when compared with was primarily due to our restructuring efforts  which resulted in a year over year decrease of million of personnel related costs  a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in facilities and infrastructure expenses 
for the year ended december   sales and marketing expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in sales and marketing expense in compared with was due primarily to our restructuring and other cost saving efforts 
these restructuring efforts resulted in a year over year decrease of million in personnel related costs  a million decrease in travel expenses and a million decrease in outside services expenses 
also contributing to the year over year decrease was a million reduction in commission expenses resulting from lower revenue in when compared with research and development 
for the year ended december   our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our research and development expense for when compared with was primarily due to workforce reductions related to our restructuring and other cost saving efforts 
these efforts resulted in a year over year decrease of million in personnel related costs  million in project materials costs and million in facilities and infrastructure expenses 
for the year ended december   our research and development expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in our research and development expense in when compared with was primarily due to workforce reductions related to our restructuring efforts  which resulted in a year over year decrease of million in our personnel related costs  a million decrease in consulting expenses  million reduction in facilities expenses and a million decrease in travel related expenses 
the decrease in relative to was also due to the million year over year decrease in non cash compensation expense  which consisted of amortization of deferred compensation and notes receivable forgiveness in these decreases in research and development expense relative to were partially offset by a million increase in project materials expenses in relative to general and administrative 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our general and administrative expense for when compared with was primarily due to workforce reductions related to our restructuring and other cost saving efforts  resulting in the following year over year decreases of million in personnel expenses  million in professional services expenses  million in insurance expense and million in depreciation expense 
partially offsetting these year over year expense reductions was the benefit of a million bad debt recovery in that was not repeated in for the year ended december   our general and administrative expense decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in our general and administrative expense for when compared with was primarily due to workforce reductions related to our restructuring efforts  which resulted in a year over year decrease of million in personnel related costs 
the decrease in year over year expenses was also due to million in professional expenses  million in bad debt expense  million in bad debt recovery and million in depreciation expense 
restructuring costs 
we incurred restructuring costs of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in august  we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction and relocation 
this restructuring program resulted in restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of the restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges related primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million in relocation expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in august  we implemented a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction  closure of our new jersey research and development facility  and disposal of certain of our fixed assets 
as a result of this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million in the third quarter of these restructuring costs consisted of million in workforce reduction charges relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits and million relating to closure of the new jersey facility 
in november  we undertook further restructuring efforts that included an additional workforce reduction  the termination of our pleasanton  california facility lease and disposal of certain fixed assets 
as a result of these november efforts  we recorded restructuring costs of million  comprising severance and employee outplacement expenses of approximately million  million to terminate our pleasanton  california lease early  million for abandonment of leasehold improvements  million for abandonment of fixed assets and million to terminate various equipment leases 
in aggregate  we reduced our workforce by approximately in fiscal in april  we implemented a restructuring program that included a reduction in our workforce  closure of excess facilities  and the disposition of certain fixed assets 
as a result of this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million in the second quarter of these restructuring costs were comprised of million in workforce reduction charges relating primarily to severance and related benefits  million relating to closure of excess facilities and million in other fixed assets retired as a result of the workforce reductions 
in october  we further reduced our workforce by an additional  which resulted in restructuring costs of million during the fourth quarter of  for severance and related benefits payments 
in process research and development 
during the year ended december  we did not incur any expenses related to in process research and development 
amounts expensed as in process research and development were million in and million in for the year ended december   our in process research and development expense of million was solely related to in process research and development purchased from vtc in november we expensed the purchased in process technology upon acquisition because technological feasibility of the technology had not been established and there were no future alternative uses for the technology 
we estimated the in process technology percentage of completion to be  and for the astria  m and software product lines  respectively 
we determined the value of this in process technology by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the net cash flows from the sale of the product after the completion of the in process technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a risk weighted discount rate of 
research and development costs to bring in process technology from vtc to technological feasibility were completed in for the year ended december   the in process research and development expense of million was solely related to in process research and development purchased from activetelco during the first quarter of we expensed the purchased in process technology upon acquisition because technological feasibility of the technology had not been established and there were no future alternative uses for the technology 
we estimated the in process technology percentage of completion to be 
we determined the value of this in process technology by estimating the cost to develop the purchased in process technology into a commercially viable product  estimating the net cash flows from the sale of the product after the completion of the in process technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a risk weighted discount rate of 
research and development costs to bring in process technology from activetelco to technological feasibility did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
impairment of intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we determined that certain of the technology acquired as part of the purchase of the viagate assets had become impaired 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the book value of the intangible assets associated with this technology 
there was no such impairment for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded million in impairment of intangible assets 
of this million  we recorded a million impairment charge in the first quarter of to write off the completed technology and patents of freegate 
this resulted from our decision not to pursue further incorporation of the related onegate product and other intellectual property acquired from freegate into the design of future products 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge in the third quarter of to write off all of the remaining goodwill and assembled workforce and reduce the book value of our completed technology and patents 
we determined the amount of the charge based on estimated discounted future cash flows using a discount rate of 
we used our best estimates to make assumptions about future cash flows including the discount rate and considered a number of underlying factors that contributed to the decline in expected future cash flows  including a continued slowdown in the telecommunications market  and the indefinite postponement of capital expenditures  particularly within the hospitality industry 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is comprised of intangibles related to the acquisitions of vintel in  freegate  oneworld assets and xstreamis in  activetelco and viagate assets in  and vtc in the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization from these acquisitions consist primarily of completed technology and patents 
for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets increased by to million from million for the year ended december  the million increase in when compared with was primarily the result of a full year of the additional amortization associated with the intangible assets arising from our vtc acquisition in november for the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in when compared with was a result of our recording of an impairment of intangible assets totaling million in that relates to our acquisitions in and as of december   intangible assets totaling million that relate to our acquisitions in and  remain to be amortized 
impairment of certain equity investments 
impairment of certain equity investments consisted of expenses related to the write off of million invested in one privately held company during the year ended december  the value of this investment was impaired due to uncertainty associated with the on going viability of this business in the current network infrastructure industry 
there was no such impairment of our equity investments for the year ended december  interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income and expense and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
for the year ended december   our interest and other income  net decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in of million compared with was primarily the result of lower interest rates on lower average cash balances and increased interest expense associated with the million note issued in connection with our purchase of vtc in november for the year ended december   our interest and other income  net decreased by to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in compared with was primarily the result of lower interest rates on lower average cash balances 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   compared with cash and cash equivalents of million at december   reflecting a net reduction in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the reduced cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a significantly lower net loss in compared with  that was partially offset by lower non cash charges for depreciation  no charge for abandonment of fixed assets  and a smaller provision for excess and obsolete inventory and abandoned products in  compared with the same period in partially offsetting the reduced net loss was an increase in accounts receivable  due to the recognition of more revenue earned in the last month of the fourth quarter of compared with the same period in additions to property and equipment were million in  compared with million in  primarily reflecting an increased investment in research and development assets 
in we expect capital expenditures to be comparable to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million during the year ended december   resulted primarily from our use of million for operating activities and the purchase of property and equipment of million 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents from these uses was offset by million in proceeds from the maturities in short term investments  the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan of million and million related to the acquisition of vtc 
we have entered into certain contractual obligations including inventory purchase commitments of million at december   that will result in future cash outflows 
our future minimum lease payments under operating leases at december  are as follows year in millions thereafter as part of our acquisition of vtc from tektronix in november  we issued a note payable to tektronix for million  with repayment in sixty months  or by november the interest rate on this note is and is compounded annually 
through january   the accrued interest is added to the principal balance of the note 
thereafter  we will pay accrued interest on this note commencing on january  and on each april  july and october thereafter until the principal balance is paid in full 
principal and accrued interest on the note payable is million at december  we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  negative cash flows from operating activities of million  and have an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that the cash and cash equivalents as of december  are sufficient to fund our operating activities and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months 
in future periods  we generally anticipate that our working capital will begin to increase as a result of several factors including our expectation that our revenue will continue to increase on a period to period basis  we have completed payments for past inventory purchase commitments and that our prior restructurings and expense reduction efforts will result in operational expenditures that are more in line with our expected revenue 
we expect the amount of cash used to fund our operations to decrease in however  in the event that general economic conditions worsen  we may require additional cash to fund operations 
we plan to seek additional equity funding in the first quarter of to provide additional working capital  fund potential acquisitions and we may redeem the vtc acquisition indebtedness 
we cannot assure that such funding efforts will be successful 
failure to generate positive cash flow in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products including third party products  through professional services and the sale of our software products 
we sell products through direct sales channels and through distributors 
generally  product revenue is generated from the sale of video trunking products and certain digital tv headend components  and the sale of private broadband network systems 
turnkey solution revenue is principally generated by the sale of complete end to end digital tv headend solutions 
product revenue 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition 
at the time of the transaction  we assess a number of factors including specific contract and purchase order terms  completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier  past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  evidence of sell through to the end user  and current payment terms 
based on the results of the assessment  we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition until evidence of sell through occurs and cash is received 
revenue from service obligations included in product revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation 
we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 
estimated sales returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase 
turnkey solution revenue 
the company s turnkey solution offerings are delivered under multi element arrangements  which include hardware  software  professional services and maintenance 
as software is not incidental to the turnkey solutions as a whole  revenue from these arrangements is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
revenue from the turnkey solutions  excluding the maintenance element  is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue  excluding maintenance  that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor effort expended to date to anticipated final labor effort  based on current estimates of total labor effort necessary to complete the project 
revenue from the maintenance element of the arrangement is deferred at the point of sale and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
generally  the terms of the turnkey solution sales provide for billing of percent of the arrangement at the time of delivery with the remaining being billed upon substantial completion of the project and customer acceptance 
license and royalty revenue 
license and royalty revenue consists of nonrefundable up front license fees  some of which may offset initial royalty payments  and royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
currently  the majority of our license and royalty revenue is comprised of non refundable license fees paid in advance 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided or upon delivery and transfer of agreed upon technical specifications in contracts where essentially no further support obligations exist 
future license and royalty revenue is expected to consist primarily of royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
we expect that such license and royalty revenue will not constitute a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
software license and post contract support revenue 
software revenue is derived from two separate sources  software license fees and post contract maintenance and support fees 
the software license fee typically grants a perpetual license to the customer 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of the software license when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met similar to our hardware product sales 
the revenue for maintenance and support fees is recognized ratably over the term of the separate support contract 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine that the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognition for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we record provisions to write down our inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory provisions may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information regarding the customers creditworthiness known to us 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance would be required 
accounting for long lived assets 
we are required to periodically assess the impairment of long lived assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when our management determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment measured is based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during  we determined that certain intangible long lived assets were impaired and recorded a loss of million under sfas no 
no such impairment was recorded in during  we determined that certain intangible long lived assets were impaired and recorded a loss of million under sfas no 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators once again exist 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal contingencies 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in our consolidated financial statements 
because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome to these legal proceedings 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial condition or cashflows 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations  purchase obligations   other long term liabilities total    we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the adoption of sab did not materially affect our revenue recognition policies  nor our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
additional risk factors that could affect our operating results and the market price of our stock we have a history of significant losses  and we may never achieve profitability 
we have incurred substantial net losses and experienced negative cash flow for each quarter since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses in the near future 
moreover  we may never achieve profitability and  if we do so  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
we may not be able to generate a sufficient level of revenue to offset our current level of expenditures 
moreover  because our expenditures for sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative functions are relatively fixed in the short term  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to respond to any unanticipated decline in revenue 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by securities analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
each sale of our headend systems represents a significant portion of our revenue for any given quarter 
our failure to meet our quarterly forecast of sales of headend systems in any given quarter could have a material adverse impact on our financial results for a given quarter 
since we acquired vtc in november  a large part of our quarterly revenue is associated with the sale of headend systems 
each sale represents a significant portion of our revenue for each quarter 
we base our operating forecast on our historical sales 
because of the high cost per unit of our headend systems  if we were to sell even one less system than our forecasted number of headend sales per quarter  such a decrease in sales would have a material and adverse impact on our revenue for that quarter  and we may fail to meet investor expectations 
we operate in an intensely competitive marketplace  and many of our competitors have better resources than we do 
in the market for our video and broadband data systems  we have experienced competition worldwide from competitors such as harmonic inc  tandberg television asa and a number of other public and private companies 
our immediate competitors in the digital tv headend markets are primarily small private companies that are focused on a more narrow product line than ours and thereby may be able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing and marketing new products than we can 
we expect that this market will continue to become more competitive in the future 
as we begin to target larger telco customers for our video content processing systems  we expect more competition from large public companies like harmonic  tandberg television  and motorola  inc these competitors have achieved success in providing headend components for cable multiple system operators and satellite tv providers 
although their products have been designed specifically to meet the needs of cable networks  we expect these competitors to market some of their products for use in tv over dsl applications 
for example  in the past  harmonic provided video content processing systems to sasktel  a large canadian telephone service provider 
harmonic also recently announced that it will provide video content processing systems to video networks limited  a video over dsl provider in the united kingdom 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and other resources than we do 
our competition in the video trunking market primarily comes from small private companies and public companies such as optibase inc and tandberg television that together offer a wide array of products with special features and functions 
a few of these companies also compete with us in the content processing digital tv headend market 
our competitive success in this market has depended upon our having the right form factor and set of features required for a specific application  our long established channels of distribution and our ability to quickly modify an existing product to support the required features 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to have success in this market  that we will be able to develop and offer the required features for many applications in a reasonable timeframe  nor that we will be able to offer products at a competitive price for this market 
our private broadband network business tends to compete against public  private and foreign network equipment companies 
to maintain our competitive position in the private broadband market  we have focused our product development efforts on cost reduction and feature enhancement 
our expertise in particular vertical markets such as the hospitality industry  and our relationships with system integrators in those markets allow us to compete more effectively against larger competitors 
in addition  we cannot assure you that new competitors will not enter our markets and develop enhancements to  or future generations of  competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features relative to our products 
accordingly  competition for our customers is intense  and our competitors are offering substantial pricing concessions and incentives to attract potential and existing customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures that we face will not harm our business 
commercial acceptance of any technological solution that competes with technology based on communication over copper telephone wire could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets for video content processing  video trunking and high speed data access systems and services are characterized by several competing communication technologies  including fiber optic cables  coaxial cables  satellites and other wireless facilities 
many of our products are based on communication over copper telephone wire 
because there are physical limits to the speed and distance over which data can be transmitted over copper wire  our products may not be a viable solution for customers requiring service at performance levels beyond the current limits of copper telephone wire 
our customer base is concentrated on telephone service providers that have a large investment in copper wire technology 
if these customers lose market share to their competitors who use competing technologies that are not as constrained by physical limitations as copper telephone wire  and that are able to provide faster access  greater reliability  increased cost effectiveness or other advantages  demand for our products will decrease 
moreover  to the extent that our customers choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media as part of their infrastructure  or to the extent that homes and businesses install other transmission media within buildings  demand for our products may decline 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the projected growth in demand for video services from telephone service providers does not materialize or if our customers find alternative methods of delivering video services  future sales of our video content processing systems will suffer 
we manufacture video content processing systems that enable telephone service providers to offer video service to their customers 
our customers  the telephone service providers  face competition from cable companies  satellite service providers and wireless companies 
for some users  these competing solutions provide fast access  high reliability and cost effective solutions for delivering data  including video services 
telephone service providers hope to maintain their market share in their core business of voice telephony as well as increase their revenue per customer by offering their customers more services  including video service and high speed data services 
however  if the telephone service providers find alternative ways of maintaining and growing their market share in their core business that do not require that they offer video services  demand for our products will decrease substantially 
moreover  if technological advancements are developed that allow our customers to provide video services without upgrading their current system infrastructure  or that offer our customers a more cost effective method of delivering video services  sales of our video content processing systems will suffer 
alternatively  even if the telephone service providers choose our video content processing systems  the service providers may not be successful in marketing video services to their customers  in which case our sales would decrease substantially 
our operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and this may cause the price of our stock to decline 
over the last quarters  our sales per quarter have fluctuated between million and million 
over the same periods  our loss from operations as a percentage of revenue has fluctuated between approximately and  of revenue 
we anticipate that our sales and operating margins will continue to fluctuate 
we expect this fluctuation to continue for a variety of reasons  including the timing of customers purchase decisions  acceptance of our new products and possible cancellations  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures from our partners and competitors  delays or problems in the introduction of our new products  announcements of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  and management of inventory levels 
the sales cycle for video content processing systems is long and unpredictable  which requires us to incur high sales and marketing expenses with no assurance that a sale will result 
the sales cycle for our headend systems can be as long as months 
additionally  with respect to the sale of our products to us and foreign government organizations  we may experience long sales cycles as a result of government procurement processes 
as a result  while we continue to incur costs associated with a particular sale prior to payment from the customer  we may not recognize revenue from efforts to sell particular products for extended periods of time 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of investment research analysts or investors  which could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common shares 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
we rely on contract manufacturers and third party equipment manufacturers  or oems  to manufacture  assemble  test and package our products 
we also depend upon third party suppliers for the materials and parts that constitute our products 
our reliance on contract manufacturers  oems and third party suppliers requires us to accurately forecast the demand for our products and coordinate our efforts with those of our contract manufacturers  oems and suppliers 
we often make significant up front financial commitments with our contract manufacturers  oems and suppliers in order to procure the raw materials and begin manufacturing and assembly of the products 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand or coordinate our efforts with our suppliers  oems and contract manufacturers  we may face supply  manufacturing or testing capacity constraints 
these constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products  which could lead to the loss of existing or potential customers and could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
further  we outsource the manufacturing of our products based on forecasts of sales 
if orders for our products exceed our forecasts  we may have difficulty meeting customers orders in a timely manner  which could damage our reputation or result in lost sales 
conversely  if our forecasts exceed the orders we actually receive and we are unable to cancel future purchase and manufacturing commitments in a timely manner  our inventory levels would increase 
this could expose us to losses related to slow moving and obsolete inventory  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to develop and introduce new products in response to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we compete  we will not remain competitive 
the markets for video content processing  video trunking and high speed data access systems are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products 
for example  advancements in compression technology are leading the video content processing industry to begin the transition to next generation compression standards such as mpeg and windows media these advances will allow for further reductions in the bandwidth required to deliver standard definition video channels and introduce the possibility of delivering high definition television over bandwidth constrained adsl lines for the first time 
to address these advances in technology  we have been developing software to enhance our astria content processor to encode and transcode mpeg and windows media content 
further advances in technology  such as mpeg and windows media  or the emergence of new industry standards would require that we further redesign our products to incorporate and remain compatible with emerging technologies and industry standards 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond quickly and effectively to technological change 
we may have only limited time to penetrate certain markets  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
if we fail to introduce new products that address technological changes or if we experience delays in our product introductions  our ability to compete would be adversely affected and our operating results would suffer 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our revenue  which subjects our business to a number of risks 
if we are unable to generate significant international sales  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and operating activities outside of the united states are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies  tariffs  quotas  taxes and other market barriers  political and economic instability  restrictions on the export or import of technology  potentially limited intellectual property protection  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to represent a significant and growing portion of our revenue 
however  we cannot assure you that foreign markets for our products will develop at the rate or to the extent that we anticipate 
if we fail to generate significant international sales  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates may decrease demand for our products 
substantially all of our foreign sales are invoiced in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive for international customers  thereby reducing demand for our products 
we anticipate that we will generally continue to invoice foreign sales in us dollars 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we expand our current international operations  we may allow payment in foreign currencies and  as a result  our exposure to foreign currency transaction losses may increase 
to reduce this exposure  we may purchase forward foreign exchange contracts or use other hedging strategies 
however  we cannot assure you that any currency hedging strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
if our contract manufacturers  third party oems and third party suppliers fail to produce quality products or parts in a timely manner  we may not be able to meet our customers demands 
we do not manufacture our products 
we rely on contract manufacturers and oems  to manufacture  assemble  package and test substantially all of our products and to purchase most of the raw materials and components used in our products 
additionally  we depend on third party suppliers to provide quality parts and materials to our contract manufacturers and oems  and we obtain some of the key components and sub assemblies used in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
neither we nor our contract manufacturers or oems have any guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
if our suppliers fail to provide a sufficient supply of key components  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources at reasonable prices  if at all  or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
moreover  if our contract manufacturers or oems fail to deliver quality products in a timely manner  such failure would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to customers 
delays and reductions in product shipments could increase our production costs  damage customer relationships and harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  if our contract manufacturers and oems fail to perform adequate quality control and testing of our products  we would experience increased production costs for product repair and replacement  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
moreover  defects in products that are not discovered in the quality assurance process could damage customer relationships and result in product returns or product liability claims  each of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if any of our contract manufacturers  oems or suppliers continually fail to meet our expectations  we may need to expend time and resources to develop relationships with alternative partners 
any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
design defects in our products could harm our reputation and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any defect or deficiency in our products could reduce the functionality  effectiveness or marketability of our products 
these defects or deficiencies could cause customers to cancel or delay their orders for our products  reduce revenue or render our product designs obsolete 
in that event  we would be required to devote substantial financial and other resources for a significant period of time to develop new product designs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in addressing any design defects in our products or in developing new product designs in a timely manner  if at all 
any of these events  individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our business depends on the integrity of our intellectual property rights  and if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our business could be adversely affected 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures  we cannot assure you that any of our pending or future patent or trademark applications will be allowed or that any allowed applications will be issued as patents or trademarks  any of our patents  trademarks or copyrights will not be invalidated  deemed unenforceable  circumvented or challenged  the rights granted under our patents and other intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us  any of our pending or future patent applications will issue with claims of the scope that we sought  if at all  other parties will not design around our patents and other intellectual property rights or otherwise develop similar  duplicate or superior products  or the intellectual property laws or our agreements will adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business or may do business in the future 
attempts may be made to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors  strategic partners and customers as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our trade secret technology and proprietary information 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology 
the telecommunications and data communications industries are characterized by the existence of extensive patent portfolios and frequent intellectual property litigation 
from time to time  we have received claims that we are infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that in the future third parties will not claim that we have infringed current or future patents  trademarks  or other proprietary rights relating to our products 
any present or future claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management time and attention and other resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  any such litigation could force us to cease selling or using certain products or services  or to redesign such products or services 
further  we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights or those of competitors 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to provide our customers with adequate and timely customer support  our relationships with our customers could be damaged  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain customers will depend in part on the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stage 
as our systems and products become more complex  we believe our ability to provide adequate customer support will be increasingly important to our success 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base  and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
our failure to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
failure to provide adequate support could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and relationship with our customers  could prevent us from gaining new customers and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to manage our expanding operations  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our results of operations could be harmed 
we anticipate that  in the future  we may need to expand certain areas of our business to grow our customer base and exploit market opportunities 
in particular  we expect to face numerous challenges in the implementation of our business strategy to focus on selling our products to the larger  more established service providers  in both domestic and international markets 
to manage our operations  we must  among other things  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire and train additional qualified personnel  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies and effectively manage multiple relationships with various customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit fully the market for our products or systems 
if we are unable to manage our operations effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are currently engaged in two securities class action lawsuits  either of which  if they were to result in an unfavorable resolution  could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
beginning july   nine putative stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the complaints were filed on behalf of a purported class of people who purchased our stock during the period between july  and january   seeking unspecified damages 
the complaints allege that we and certain of our current and former officers and directors made false and misleading statements about our business during the putative class period 
specifically  the complaints allege violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the complaints have been consolidated under the name in re tut systems  inc securities litigation  civil action no 
c jcs 
lead plaintiffs and lead counsel for plaintiffs have been appointed 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint on february  defendants filed a motion to dismiss on march  on august   the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss 
on september   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss portions of the amended complaint  and on august  the court granted in part that motion 
on september   defendants answered the remaining allegations of the amended complaint 
defendants have reached a settlement 
we have agreed to pay million to settle the suit 
this amount was paid by our insurance company in january the settlement includes a release of all claims of the defendants 
because the settlement is subject to court approval  there is no guarantee the settlement will become final 
on october   we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in whalen v 
tut systems  inc et al  case no 
cv  a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
an amended complaint was filed on december  a consolidated amended complaint was filed on april  the consolidated amended complaint asserts that the prospectuses from our january  initial public offering and our march  secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged actions by the underwriters for the offerings 
the complaint alleges claims against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors under section of the securities act of  as amended and under section b and rule b of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  and alleges claims against certain of our current and former officers and directors under sections and a of the securities act 
the complaints also name as defendants the underwriters for our initial public offering and secondary offering 
the complaints against the individual defendants  namely  nelson caldwell  salvatore d auria and matthew taylor  have been dismissed without prejudice by an october   order of the court  which approved and ordered the dismissals pursuant to the parties october   stipulation of dismissal 
on february   the court issued an opinion and order denying our motion to dismiss 
the company s board recently approved a tentative settlement proposal from the plaintiffs 
the settlement is subject to a number of conditions  including court approval of the proposed settling parties and the court 
if the settlement does not occur  and the litigation against the company continues  the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations in the complaint and intends to defend the case vigorously 
the company believes its insurance coverage is adequate to offset the proposed settlement 
nevertheless  an unfavorable resolution of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
if our products do not comply with complex government regulations  our product sales will suffer 
we and our customers are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local as well as foreign governmental regulation 
our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission  or fcc 
the fcc has issued regulations that set installation and equipment standards for communications systems 
our products are also required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  underwriters laboratories must certify certain of our products in order to meet federal safety requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
in addition  certain products must be network equipment building standard certified before certain of our customers may deploy them 
any delay in or failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
outside of the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which our products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
if we do not obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would not be able to sell our products where these regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or achieving profitability 
in addition  regulation of our customers may adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of data and internet services and other terms on which telecommunications companies conduct their business may impede our penetration of certain markets 
in addition  the increasing demand for communications systems has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards  generally following extensive investigation of competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process may cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may harm our sale of products to these customers 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to manage our business successfully  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the performance of salvatore d auria  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board  and on other senior management and technical personnel with experience in the video and data communications  telecommunications and high speed data access industries 
the loss of any one of them could harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive officers 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees who are in great demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we routinely evaluate acquisition candidates and other diversification strategies 
we have completed a number of acquisitions as part of our efforts to expand and diversify our business 
for example  we acquired our video content processing and video trunking businesses from tektronix in november when we purchased its subsidiary  vtc 
we intend to continue to evaluate new acquisition candidates  divestiture and diversification strategies  and if we fail to manage the integration of acquired companies  it could adversely affect our business 
any acquisition involves numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s employees  operations and products  uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers  and the potential loss of the acquired company s key employees 
additionally  we may incur unanticipated expenses  difficulties and other adverse consequences relating to the integration of technologies  research and development  and administrative and other functions 
any future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  acquisition or divestiture related write offs and the assumption of debt and contingent liabilities 
any of the above factors could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price is volatile  and  if you invest in our company  you may suffer a loss of some or all of your investment 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility  and this trend may continue 
in particular  trading volume historically has been low and the market price of our common stock has increased dramatically in recent months 
since the announcement of our acquisition of vtc  the closing price of our common stock  as traded on the nasdaq national market  has fluctuated from a low of to a high of per share 
our stock price is currently trading at or near its three year high 
the value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
factors affecting our market price include our perceived prospects  variations in our operating results and whether we have achieved our key business targets  the limited number of shares of our common stock available for purchase or sale in the public markets  differences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts  announcements of new contracts  products or technological innovations by us or our competitors  and market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors 
recent events have caused stock prices for many companies  including ours  to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance 
the general economic  political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
any such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
future sales of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
substantially all of our common stock may be sold without restriction in the public markets  subject only in the case of shares held by our officers and directors and affiliates to volume and manner of sale restrictions 
the approximately million shares of common stock that we issued to tektronix in connection with our november acquisition of vtc are restricted securities  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act  and therefore subject to certain restrictions 
however  we are contractually obligated to file and keep effective a registration statement in order to allow tektronix to sell these shares to the public 
likewise  tektronix has the right subject to certain exceptions to include these shares in certain registration statements pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales could occur could materially and adversely affect our stock price and make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price we deem appropriate 
our charter  bylaws  retention and change of control plans and delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and our retention and change of control plans  the plans  may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws and the plans could limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  restrict our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings  and provide for procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
in addition  our board has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the plans provide for severance payments and accelerated stock option vesting in the event of termination of employment following a change of control 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws  and the plans  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  to which we are subject  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we did not have investments 
an immediate change in interest rate would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million with a related weighted average interest rate of 
our long term debt of million at december  carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payment of the entire note payable balance due in november we do not have short term notes payable 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  and debt obligations 
maturity fiscal year thereafter total dollars in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents   average interest rate liablities long term debt   average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases 
foreign currency risk we transact business primarily in the us dollar 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue has not been material  as the majority of our revenue is earned in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce demand for our product 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using the period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses to us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are reported as a separate component on our statement of stockholders equity 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on translation has not been material
