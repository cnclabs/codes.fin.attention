item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
title the title segment includes the functions of searching  examining  closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property 
examination and closing 
the purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred  debts that are owed on it and the scope of the title policy coverage 
this involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds  mortgages  wills  divorce decrees  court judgments  liens  paving assessments and tax records 
at the closing or settlement  the seller executes and delivers a deed to the new owner 
the buyer typically signs new mortgage documents 
closing funds are then disbursed to the seller  the prior mortgage company  real estate brokers  the title company and others 
the documents are then recorded in the public records 
a title policy is generally issued to both the lender and the new owner 
title policies 
lenders in the united states generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate  including securitized lending 
this is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position 
the purchasers of the property want insurance against claims that may arise against the ownership of the property 
the face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan 
title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance 
fire  auto  health and life insurance protect against losses and events in the future 
in contrast  title insurance seeks to eliminate most risks through the examination and settlement process 
investments 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  an emphasis upon credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix based upon market conditions 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale 
losses 
losses on policies primarily occur because of a title defect not discovered during the examination and settlement process 
other reasons for losses include forgeries  misrepresentations  unrecorded construction liens  the failure to pay off existing liens  mishandling of settlement funds  issuance by agencies of unauthorized coverages and other legal issues 
some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits 
those claims are based on various legal theories usually alleging misrepresentation by an agency 
although we vigorously defend against spurious claims  we have from time to time incurred a loss in excess of policy limits 
experience shows that most claims against policies and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued  although claims may be made many years later 
by their nature  claims are often complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims 
estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims  the long periods of time over which claims are paid  significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors 
our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and other losses expected to be reported in the future 
the amount of our loss reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims 
provisions are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized 
the amounts provided are based on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages  current legal environment and types of policies written 
amounts shown as our estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate 
independent actuaries also review the adequacy of the liability amounts on an annual basis and found our reserves adequate at each year end 
in accordance with industry practice  the amounts have not been discounted to their present values 
factors affecting revenues 
title revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate markets we serve and the prices at which real estate sales are made 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases 
other factors include demand by buyers  consumer confidence and family incomes 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
generally  the third quarter is the most active in terms of real estate sales and the first quarter is the least active 
in addition  when interest rates decline  the number of refinancing transactions and associated revenues generally increase 
selected information for the national real estate industry follows amounts are preliminary housing starts millions housing resales millions housing resales median sales price in thousands 
customers 
the primary sources of title business are attorneys  builders  developers  lenders and real estate brokers 
no one customer was responsible for as much as ten percent of our title revenues in any of the last three years 
titles insured included residential and commercial properties  undeveloped acreage  farms  ranches and water rights 
service  location  financial strength  size and related factors affect customer acceptance 
increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service 
the parties to a closing are concerned with personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement 
the rates charged to customers are regulated  to varying degrees  by different states 
financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing our agency network 
out of the nation s top four title insurers  we earned one of the highest ratings awarded by the title industry s leading rating companies 
our principal underwriter  stewart title guaranty company guaranty is currently rated a by demotech  inc  a by fitch  a by lace financial  a by moody s and a by standard poor s 
market share 
title insurance statistics are compiled annually by the title industry s national association 
based on unconsolidated statutory net premiums written for amounts are not yet available  guaranty is one of the leading title insurers in america 
our principal competitors include fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation and landamerica financial group  inc like most title insurers  we also compete with abstractors  attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney owned title insurance bar funds 
we also compete with issuers of alternative title insurance products  which typically provide more limited coverage and less service for a smaller premium 
a number of homebuilders  financial institutions  real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agencies  some of which issue policies underwritten by guaranty 
this controlled business also provides competition for our agencies 
title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others  offices 
at december   we had  locations issuing policies  compared with  a year earlier and  two years earlier 
of these totals   and  were independent agencies at december   and  respectively 
regulations 
title insurance companies are subject to extensive state regulations covering premium rates  agency licensing  policy forms  trade practices  reserve requirements  investments and the flow of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transaction 
kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by various state and federal laws 
real estate information the real estate information segment primarily provides electronic delivery of data  products and services related to real estate transactions 
our services related to the mortgage origination process include flood zone determinations  credit reports  traditional and automated property valuations  electronic mortgage documents  property reports and tax services 
we also provide post closing outsourcing services for residential mortgage lenders  including document review  investor delivery  fha va insuring  document retrieval  preparation and recordation of assignments and lien releases  recordation services  collateral reviews and loan pool certifications 
in addition  we provide diverse products and services related to irc section tax deferred exchanges  automated mapping projects and geodetic positioning  real estate database conversion  construction  maintenance and access  automation for government recording and registration  and criminal  credit and motor vehicle background checks and pre employment screening services 
factors affecting revenues 
as in the title segment  rei revenues  particularly those generated by mortgage information services and tax deferred exchanges  are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market 
revenues related to many services are generated on a project basis 
contracts for automating government recording and registration and mapping projects are often awarded through a lengthy bid process 
our principal competitors vary across the wide range of services 
in the mortgage related products and services area  competitors include the major title underwriters mentioned under title  as well as entities known as vendor management companies 
customers 
the primary sources of our rei business are residential mortgage lenders and servicers 
our timeliness and accuracy in providing services are critical to our customers since it directly affects the service they provide to their customer  primarily the borrower 
delays and errors directly impact the cost of originating or servicing the loan or the value of the loan asset 
our other customers include title agencies  county clerks and recorders  municipalities  real estate professionals and attorneys 
our financial strength  marketplace presence and reputation as a technology innovator are important factors in attracting new business 
general technology 
our automation products and services are increasing productivity in the title office and speeding the real estate closing process for lenders  real estate professionals and consumers 
before automation  an order typically required several individuals to search the title  retrieve and review documents and create the title policy commitment 
today  on a normal subdivision file  one person can receive the order electronically and  on the same computer screen  view the prior file  examine the index of documents  retrieve and review electronically stored documents  prepare the title policy commitment and deliver the product 
trademarks 
we have developed numerous automation products and processes that are crucial to both our title and rei segments 
these systems automate most facets of the real estate transaction 
among these trademarked products and processes are aim r  e title r  globexplorer r  landata title office r  landata title plant r  landscan r  reimall r  sureclose r  titlelogix r and virtual underwriter r 
we consider these trademarks  which are perpetual in duration  to be important in our business

item legal proceedings in november  stewart was served as a defendant in a new york state class action lawsuit presently pending in the supreme court state of new york nassau county alleging that stewart directly and through its agencies routinely collected excess premiums in connection with refinance transactions 
similar actions were brought against seven other underwriters and the matters have been consolidated 
each plaintiff moved for class certification and on january  class certification was granted 
the plaintiffs are two individuals on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated against a subsidiary of stewart 
stewart has engaged counsel and is vigorously defending the action 
stewart denies culpability on a number of grounds 
stewart intends to file a notice of appeal on the class certification decision 
the complaint seeks damages on amounts yet to be determined and also seeks reasonable attorney fees and other relief the court deems just and proper 
the ultimate resolution of this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
in addition  we are a party to a number of lawsuits incurred in connection with our business  most of which are of a routine nature involving disputed policy claims 
in many of these suits  the plaintiff seeks exemplary or treble damages in excess of policy limits based on the alleged malfeasance of an issuing agency 
we do not expect that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary 
we discuss below our most critical accounting areas that involve significant estimates accruing title loss reserves  evaluating the possible impairment of goodwill and other intangibles and accruing unreported premium revenues from agencies 
we also discuss an important change that has been proposed to the real estate settlement procedures act respa and its potential effect on our industry 
we describe what we do mostly title insurance and the material effect that changes in mortgage interest rates and other factors can have on our revenues 
for the years through  we summarize the interest rate environment prevailing in those years 
we also discuss the reasons for significant increases and decreases in our revenues and expenses 
our major sources of cash flow and our liquidity and capital resources are discussed 
certain legal restrictions that exist on cash transfers from our title insurer subsidiaries to our parent are described 
critical accounting estimates 
actual results can differ from the estimates we report 
however  we believe there is no material risk of a change in our accounting estimates that is likely to have a material impact on our reported financial condition and operating performance for the three years ended december our most critical accounting estimate is providing title loss reserves 
estimating future policy loss payments is difficult because claims  by their nature  are complex and paid over long periods of time 
we base our estimates on reported claims  historical loss experience and industry averages 
independent actuaries have reviewed and found our reserves adequate at each year end 
based on events that may indicate impairment of title plants and other long lived assets  and our annual evaluation of goodwill  we estimate and expense any loss in value to our current operations 
amounts expensed in the three years ended december  were immaterial 
we use independent appraisers to assist us in determining the fair value of goodwill 
we report premium revenues from agencies primarily when policies are reported to us 
we also accrue for unreported policies where reasonable estimates can be made 
we consider historical reporting patterns  current trends in interest rates and other factors and known information about the agencies 
in this accrual  we are not estimating future transactions 
we are estimating policies that have already been issued but not received by us 
respa 
in late december  the department of housing and urban development hud issued its proposed final rule concerning reforms to respa 
we believe the new rule provides exemptions to current respa prohibitions against kickbacks and rebates 
the new rule may result in a bundling of title and other real estate services and placing them under the control of a relatively small number of major lenders 
in our view  the new rule will likely increase prices to the ultimate consumer 
if the new rule becomes final  it is likely that a major group of parties in the real estate  mortgage and settlement industries will ask the courts to intervene 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these actions 
nor can we estimate the amount of the negative effect of the new rule on our future earnings 
what we do 
our primary business is title insurance and settlement related services 
we close transactions and issue policies on homes  commercial properties and other real property located in all states  the district of columbia and several foreign countries through more than  issuing locations  including both direct operations and agencies 
we also sell electronically delivered real estate services and information  as well as mapping products and geographic information systems  to domestic and foreign governments and private entities 
our current levels of non usa operations are immaterial with respect to our consolidated financial results 
our business has two main segments title insurance related services and real estate information rei 
these segments are closely related due to the nature of their operations and common customers 
factors affecting revenues 
the principal factors that contribute to increases in our operating revenues for our title and rei segments include declining mortgage interest rates  which usually increase home sales and refinancing transactions  rising home prices  higher premium rates  increased market share  opening of new offices  acquisitions  and a higher ratio of commercial transactions that  although relatively few in number  typically yield higher premiums 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
results of operations a comparison of the results of operations of the company for with and with follows 
operating environment 
according to published industry data  interest rates for year fixed rate mortgages  excluding points  for the year averaged compared to in comparable rates averaged in in rates held steady at close to for most of the year and continued to hold steady at that level until april rates then declined through december  reaching a low of 
in  rates remained relatively steady  just below for the first quarter  reaching a low of in mid march 
rates fluctuated in the second quarter but decreased to in june 
rates increased in the third quarter to in september and then decreased to in december 
operating in these interest rate environments  real estate activity was strong in and nationwide  refinancing transactions remained strong in the ratio of refinancings to total loan applications was for  for and for existing home sales increased in over and in from our order levels began to decline in the third quarter of  largely as a result of an increase in interest rates 
increases in rates tend to reduce real estate activity  particularly refinancings 
rates declined slightly in the fourth quarter 
most industry experts project interest rates to continue at current levels or move slightly higher 
due to the large number of refinancings completed in  significantly fewer refinancing transactions are being forecast for title revenues 
our revenues from direct operations increased in and in the number of direct closings we handled increased in and in the largest revenue increases in were in california  texas and washington 
the largest increases in were in california  texas and florida 
direct closings relate only to files closed by our underwriters and subsidiaries and do not include closings by independent agencies 
the average revenue per closing increased in due to a lower ratio of refinancings closed by our direct operations compared to the prior year 
the average revenue per closing decreased 
in title insurance premiums on refinancings are typically less than on property sales 
premium revenues from agencies increased in and in the increases in and were primarily due to the increases in both refinancings and property sales 
the largest revenue increases in were in california  new york and florida 
the largest increases in were in california  pennsylvania  new york  virginia and texas 
title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others  rei revenues 
real estate information revenues were million in  million in and million in the increases in and resulted primarily from providing a greater number of post closing services  electronic mortgage documents and section exchange services resulting from the large volume of real estate transactions 
investments 
investment income decreased in because of lower yields  partially offset by increases in average balances invested 
investment income increased in primarily because of increases in average balances invested  partially offset by lower yields 
certain investment gains in  and were realized as part of the ongoing management of the investment portfolio for the purpose of improving performance 
agency retention 
the amounts retained by agencies  as a percentage of revenues from agency operations  were  and in the years  and  respectively 
amounts retained by title agencies are based on agreements between agencies and our title underwriters 
the percentage that amounts retained by agencies bears to agency revenues may vary from year to year because of the geographical mix of agency operations and the volume of title revenues 
selected cost ratios by segment 
the following table shows employee costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of related title and real estate information operating revenues for the last three years 
employee costs other operating title rei these two categories of expenses are discussed below in terms of year to year monetary increases 
employee costs 
employee costs for the combined business segments increased in and in the number of persons we employed at december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in staff in and was primarily due to increased title and rei volume and acquisitions of new offices 
in our rei segment  employee costs increased in and primarily due to our focus to provide more post closing services to lenders 
these services are considerably more labor intensive than other rei services 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the combined business segments increased in and in the increase in other operating expenses in was primarily in new offices  search fees  premium taxes and business promotion 
in the increase was primarily in search fees  premium taxes  new offices and business promotion 
other operating expenses also include rent  supplies  telephone  title plant expenses  travel and auto 
most of these operating expenses follow  to varying degrees  the changes in transaction volume and revenues 
our employee costs and certain other operating costs are sensitive to inflation 
to the extent inflation causes increases in the prices of homes and other real estate  premium revenues also increase 
premiums are determined in part by the insured values of the transactions we handle 
title losses 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title operating revenues  were  and in  and  respectively 
income taxes 
the provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes represented effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
contractual obligations 
the table below describes our contractual obligations existing at december  payments due by period millions less than more than year years years years total long term debt operating leases material contractual obligations consist mainly of notes payable and operating leases 
all operating leases are for office space and expire over the next years 
liquidity and capital resources 
acquisitions during  and resulted in additions to goodwill of million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been the primary source of financing for additions to property and equipment  expanding operations  dividends to shareholders and other requirements 
this source may be supplemented by bank borrowings 
we do not have any material source of liquidity or financing that involves off balance sheet arrangements 
the most significant non operating sources of cash were from proceeds of investments matured and sold in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we used cash for the purchases of investments in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in august we issued million shares of common stock at per share  resulting in net proceeds of million 
a substantial majority of consolidated cash and investments was held by stewart title guaranty company guaranty and its subsidiaries 
cash transfers between guaranty and its subsidiaries and the company are subject to certain legal restrictions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
our liquidity at december   excluding guaranty and its subsidiaries  was comprised of cash and investments aggregating million and short term liabilities of million 
we know of no commitments or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to fund cash needs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our capital resources to be adequate 
our capital resources are represented by a low debt to equity ratio  in which long term debt is million and stockholders equity is million at december  we are not aware of any trends  either favorable or unfavorable  that would materially affect notes payable or stockholders equity 
we do not expect any material changes in the cost of such resources 
significant acquisitions in the future could materially affect the notes payable or stockholders equity balances 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the discussion below about our risk management strategies includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
management s projections of hypothetical net losses in the fair value of our market rate sensitive financial instruments  should certain potential changes in market rates occur  is presented below 
while we believe that the potential market rate changes are reasonably possible  actual rate changes could differ 
our only material market risk in investments in financial instruments is our debt securities portfolio 
we invest primarily in marketable municipal  us government  corporate and mortgage backed debt securities 
we do not invest in financial instruments of a hedging or derivative nature 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  an emphasis upon credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
the market value of our investments in debt securities at december  was million 
debt securities at december  mature  according to their contractual terms  as follows actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized market cost value omitted in one year or less   after one year through two years   after two years through three years   after three years through four years   after four years through five years   after five years   mortgage backed securities we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and do not expect any material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities we hold 
our investments are not collateralized 
the mortgage backed securities are insured by us government agencies 
based on our debt securities portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease increase of approximately million  or  in the fair value of our portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would only be realized upon the sale of the investments 
any other than temporary declines in market values of securities are charged to earnings
