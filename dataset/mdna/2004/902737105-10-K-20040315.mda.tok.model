in july we announced that we had uncovered collateral shortfalls in the type and amount of collateral supporting two of the securitized student loan financing facilities of ams and the failure to comply with reporting obligations under the financing documents at seven of those facilities 
we subsequently entered into waiver and release agreements requiring us in july to contribute million in cash to the capital of ams 
following the collateral issues at ams  we determined to dispose of our interest in the subsidiary  and on november  we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in ams 
senior market division our senior market division formerly specialized in the development of long term care and medicare supplement insurance products for the senior market 
in may  we determined to exit the businesses of our senior market division by sale or wind down  and as a result we designated and have classified the senior market division as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 
special risk division our former special risk division specialized in certain niche health related products including stop loss  marine crew accident  organ transplant and international travel accident products  various insurance intermediary services and certain managed care services 
in december  we determined to exit the businesses of our special risk division by sale  abandonment or wind down  and we designated and have classified the special risk division as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents sub prime credit card operations in march  our board of directors determined  after a thorough assessment of the unit s prospects  that we would exit from the sub prime credit card business and  as a result  the unit was reflected as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes effective december  on september   we completed the sale of substantially all of the non cash assets associated with the operation  including its credit card receivables portfolios and its sioux falls  south dakota servicing operations  for a cash sales price of approximately million  and on january   we completed the voluntary liquidation of our special purpose national bank  in accordance with the terms of a plan of voluntary liquidation approved by the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the credit card operations results in and included income associated with a release of reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively  resulting from the company s assessment of certain favorable events related to credit card litigation matters and ultimate resolution and settlement of ongoing litigation 
at december   there were no remaining assets associated with its sub prime credit card operations 
third party administration business prior to  we provided underwriting  claims management and claims administrative services to third party insurance carriers  third party administrators  blue cross blue shield organizations and self administered employer health care plans 
we formerly classified as our third party administration division the operations of our subsidiaries  uici administrators  inc a company engaged in the business of providing third party benefits administration  including eligibility and billing reconciliation  insurdata marketing services  llc a subsidiary engaged in the business of marketing third party benefits administration services and barron risk management  inc a company engaged in the business of administration of workers compensation and non subscriber plans 
on january   we completed the sale of uici administrators  inc the major component of the third party administration division  and on september   we sold to an unaffiliated third party all of the capital stock of barron risk management services  inc the sole remaining component of the third party administration division 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations of uici administrators  inc have been reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
reinsurance our insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the coverages provided by their insurance products with other insurance companies on both an excess of loss and coinsurance basis 
the maximum retention by us on one individual in the case of life insurance is  we use reinsurance for our health insurance business only for limited purposes 
we do not reinsure any health insurance issued in the self employed market 
reinsurance agreements are intended to limit an insurer s maximum loss 
the ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured 
although we  through coinsurance  assume risks under policies issued by aegon  and we have occasionally used assumption reinsurance to acquire blocks of insurance from other insurers  we have not historically regularly assumed risks of other insurance companies 
see business health insurance coinsurance arrangements 
competition our insurance subsidiaries operate in highly competitive markets 
the insurance subsidiaries compete with large national insurers  regional insurers and specialty insurers  many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources or greater claims paying ability ratings than do we 
in addition to claims paying ability ratings  insurers compete on the basis of price  breadth and flexibility of coverage  ability to attract and retain agents and the quality and level of agent and policyholder services provided 

table of contents regulatory and legislative matters health care reform  privacy initiatives the health care industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
proposals that have been considered include cost controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  patients bills of rights and requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees 
there can be no assurance that future health care legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
legislation and regulations governing the use and security of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  has had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business and future results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations privacy initiatives 
insurance regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in their states of domicile and the other states in which they do business under statutes that typically delegate broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to insurance departments 
the method of regulation varies  but the subject matter of such regulation covers  among other things  the amount of dividends and other distributions that can be paid by the insurance subsidiaries without prior approval or notification  the granting and revoking of licenses to transact business  trade practices  including with respect to the protection of consumers  disclosure requirements  privacy standards  minimum loss ratios  premium rate regulation  underwriting standards  approval of policy forms  claims payment  licensing of insurance agents and the regulation of their conduct  the amount and type of investments that the insurance subsidiaries may hold  minimum reserve and surplus requirements  risk based capital requirements  and compelled participation in  and assessments in connection with  risk sharing pools and guaranty funds 
such regulation is intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual statements with the state insurance regulatory departments and are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations by such departments 
the most recently completed financial examination for mega in oklahoma mega s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for mid west in tennessee mid west s domicile state was completed as of and for the five year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for chesapeake in oklahoma chesapeake s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  state insurance departments have also periodically conducted and continue to conduct market conduct examinations of uici s insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   either or both of mega and mid west were subject to ongoing market conduct examinations and or open inquiries with respect to marketing practices in states 
state insurance regulatory agencies have authority to levy monetary fines and penalties resulting from findings made during the course of such market conduct examinations 
historically  our insurance subsidiaries have from time to time been subject to such fines and penalties  none of which individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the national association of insurance commissioners naic convened a special task force to review association group coverage  and we are aware that selected states are reviewing the laws and regulations under which association group policies are issued 
we and our insurance company subsidiaries are also parties to several lawsuits challenging the nature of the relationship between our insurance companies and the membership associations that make available to their members our insurance companies health 
table of contents insurance products 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we believe that we are providing association group coverage in full compliance with applicable law  changes in our relationship with the membership associations and or changes in the laws and regulations governing so called association group insurance particularly changes that would subject the issuance of policies to prior premium rate approval and or require the issuance of policies on a guaranteed issue basis could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and or business 
many states have also enacted insurance holding company laws that require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations 
such laws vary from state to state  but typically require periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the controlled insurer and prior notice to  or approval by  the applicable regulator of inter corporate transfers of assets and other transactions including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the controlled insurer within the holding company system 
such laws often also require the prior approval for the acquisition of a significant ownership interest ie  or more in the insurance holding company 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to such laws  and we believe that such subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable insurance holding company laws and regulations 
under the risk based capital initiatives adopted in by the naic  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
risk based capital formulas are intended to evaluate risks associated with asset quality  adverse insurance experience  losses from asset and liability mismatching  and general business hazards 
this information is intended to permit regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but it is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratio for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are licensed have the authority to change the minimum mandated statutory loss ratios to which they are subject  the manner in which these ratios are computed and the manner in which compliance with these ratios is measured and enforced 
loss ratios are commonly defined as incurred claims divided by earned premiums 
most states in which our insurance subsidiaries write insurance have adopted the loss ratios recommended by the naic  but frequently the loss ratio regulations do not apply to the types of health insurance issued by our subsidiaries 
we are unable to predict the impact of i any changes in the mandatory statutory loss ratios for individual or group policies to which we may become subject  or ii any change in the manner in which these minimums are computed or enforced in the future 
such changes could result in a narrowing of profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have not been informed by any state that our insurance subsidiaries do not meet mandated minimum ratios  and we believe that we are in compliance with all such minimum ratios 
in the event that we are not in compliance with minimum statutory loss ratios mandated by regulatory authorities with respect to certain policies  we may be required to reduce or refund premiums  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 
the naic and state insurance departments are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations  including those related to reducing the risk of insolvency and related accreditation standards 
to date  the increase in solvency related oversight has not had a significant impact on our insurance business 
employees we had approximately  employees at february  we consider our employee relations to be good

all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect this allocation 

table of contents over the past three years we have actively endeavored to simplify our business by closing and or disposing of assets and operations not otherwise related to our core health and life insurance operations 
we have separately classified as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes the operations of our former academic management services corp

ams our former subsidiary engaged in the student loan origination and funding business  student loan servicing business  and tuition installment payment plan business and the failure to comply with reporting obligations under the financing documents at seven of those facilities 
we subsequently entered into waiver and release agreements requiring us in july to contribute million in cash to the capital of ams 
following the collateral issues at ams  we decided to dispose of our interest in the subsidiary  and on november  we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in ams 
we generated from the sale net cash proceeds of approximately million 
at closing  we also received uninsured student loan assets formerly held by one of ams special purpose financing subsidiaries with a face amount of approximately million including accrued interest 
in anticipation of the sale of ams  in the third quarter of the company wrote down the carrying value of these loans to fair value  which was significantly less than the face amount of the loans 
as part of the transaction  the purchaser agreed to assume responsibility for liquidating and terminating the remaining special purpose financing facilities through which ams previously securitized student loans

change in reserving estimates self employed agency division effective january   the company s sea division made certain refinements to its claim and future benefit liability estimates  the net effect of which decreased claim and future policy benefit liabilities and correspondingly increased operating income reported by the sea division in the amount of million in the first quarter of set forth below is a summary of the adjustments and changes in accounting estimates made by the company 
rop liability changes the company has issued certain health policies with a return of premium rop rider  pursuant to which the company undertakes to return to the policyholder on or after age all premiums paid less claims reimbursed under the policy 
the rop rider also provides that the policyholder may receive a portion of the benefit prior to age historically  the company has established a liability for future rop benefits  which liability has been calculated by applying mid terminal reserve factors calculated on two year preliminary term basis  using interest  cso mortality terminations  and level future gross premiums to the current premium on a contract by contract basis 
a claim offset was applied  on a contract by contract basis  solely with respect to an older closed block of policies  utilizing only claims paid to date  with no assumption of future claims 
the rop liability is reflected in future policy and contract benefits on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company records an rop liability to fund longer term obligations associated with the rop rider 
this liability is impacted both by the techniques utilized to calculate the liability and the many assumptions underlying the calculation  including interest rates  policy lapse rates  premium rate increases on policies and assumptions with regard to claims paid 
the company has previously utilized a simplified reserving technique described above that it believed generated an appropriate rop liability in the aggregate 
however  the company reviewed its rop reserving technique in order to determine if refinements to the technique were appropriate 
as a result of such review  and as more particularly described in the paragraph below  effective january   the rop reserving technique was refined to utilize new mid terminal reserve factors calculated on a net level basis  using interest  cso mortality and  assuming annual increases in future gross premiums and to apply these factors to the historical premium payments on a contract by contract basis 
the net premium assumption was revised from two year preliminary term to net level in order to produce a more appropriate accrual for the liability of the rop benefits in relation to the premiums 
the interest rate assumption was reduced from to to reflect current investment yields 
since the rop rider is primarily attached to attained age rated health insurance products that are subject to periodic rate adjustment  the company has determined as part of its ongoing review of the rop reserving technique to increase its rop liability to cover reasonably foreseeable changes to the future gross premium 
based on company experience  the revised reserve factors incorporate an assumption of average annual increase in future gross premiums on such products 
the reserve technique was also refined to use historical premiums and anticipated future premium increases in the calculation of future benefits rather than calculating the reserve only from the current gross premium 
finally  a claim offset for actual benefits paid through the reporting date is now applied to the rop liability for all policies on a contract by contract basis 
in the original simplified reserve technique  the intent was to balance the offsetting effects of applying the two year preliminary term factors to the current gross premiums  since the historical premium information was not available 
changes to the technique were made in when sufficient historical premium information was available to refine the reserve calculation 
substantially all of the effect of this change in estimating the liability for future rop benefits was attributed to the refinement of adding the assumption of a average annual increase in future gross premiums 

table of contents as a result of these changes  the liability for future rop benefits increased by million during the first quarter of claims liability changes the sea division utilizes the developmental method to estimate claims liabilities 
under the developmental method  completion factors are applied to claim payments in order to estimate the ultimate claim payments 
these completion factors are derived from historical experience and are dependent on the incurred dates of the claim payments 
prior to january   the company utilized the original incurred date coding definition to establish the date a policy claim is incurred under the developmental method 
under the original incurred date coding definition  prior to the end of the period in which a health policy claim was made  the company estimated and recorded a liability for the cost of all medical services related to the accident or sickness relating to the claim  even though the medical services associated with such accident or sickness might not be rendered to the insured until a later financial reporting period 
due to the continual favorable development in the company s reserve estimates and the anticipation of a future increase in this level of favorable development associated with the growth in business  the company undertook an analysis of the reserve estimation process 
the company believes that the developmental method is the standard methodology within the health insurance industry and therefore re evaluated the key assumptions utilized under this method 
as the company gained more experience with the older blocks of business  the original incurred date coding assumption was re examined 
this re examination resulted in the decision to utilize a new incurred date definition instead of the original incurred date definition for purposes of estimating claim liabilities for the sea division 
effective january   the company determined to utilize a new incurred date coding definition to establish incurred dates under the developmental method in the sea division 
under this new incurred date coding definition  a break in service of more than six months will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
in addition  under this new incurred date coding definition  claims for services provided more than thirty six months after the original incurred date will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
this change in the incurred date definition assumption resulted in a reduction in the estimated claim liabilities at the sea division in the amount of million during the first quarter of other changes in estimate several refinements in the claims liability calculation  all of which were treated as changes in accounting estimates  resulted in a further reduction of the claims liability in the amount of million during the first quarter of this reduction in the claims liability was attributable primarily to the effects of a change in estimate of the reserve for excess pending claims 
this change was necessary to maintain consistency with the historical data underlying the calculation of the new completion factors used in the claim development reserve 
these completion factors are based on more recent experience with claims payments than the previous factors 
this more recent experience has a greater number of pending claims 
as a result  the new completion factors have built in a higher level of reserves for pending claims 
the release of a portion of the excess pending claims reserve reflects the additional pending claims included in the completion factors

the timing and extent of additional repurchases  if any  will depend on market conditions and the company s evaluation of its financial resources at the time of purchase 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to health and life insurance claims  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies and litigation 
the 
table of contents company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
claims liabilities the company establishes liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported under health and life insurance contracts 
the company calculates a single best estimate of the liability developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider a number of items  including but not limited to historical and current claim payment patterns  product variations  the timely implementation of appropriate rate increases and seasonality 
the company does not develop ranges in the setting of the claims liability reported in the financial statements 
however  to the extent not already reflected in the actuarial analyses  management also considers qualitative factors that may affect the ultimate benefit levels to determine its best estimate of the claims liability 
these qualitative considerations include  among others  the impact of medical inflation  utilization of health services  exposure levels  product mix  pending claim levels and other relevant factors 
the company uses the developmental method to estimate claim liabilities 
this method applies completion factors to claim payments in order to estimate the ultimate amount of the claim 
these completion factors are derived from historical experience and are dependent on the incurred dates of the claim payments 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
for health care costs payable  the claim liability balances and the related benefit expenses are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the claims liability calculations 
with respect to health claims  the items that have the greatest impact on the company s financial results are the medical cost trend  which is the rate of increase in health care costs  and the unpredictable variability in actual experience 
any adjustments to prior period claim liabilities are included in the benefit expense of the period in which adjustments are identified 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs and actual experience  adjustments to health claim liabilities usually occur each quarter and are sometimes significant 
the company believes that its recorded claim liabilities are reasonable and adequate to satisfy its ultimate claims liability 
each of the company s major operating units has an actuarial staff that has primary responsibility for assessing the claim liabilities 
the company uses its own experience as appropriate and relies on industry loss experience as necessary in areas where the company s data is limited 
our estimate of claim liabilities represents management s best estimate of the company s liability as of december  assuming a hypothetical difference in the loss ratio ie  benefits  claims and settlement expenses stated as a percentage of earned premiums for the year ended december   net income would increase or decrease by approximately million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by approximately per share 
prior to january   the company utilized the original incurred date coding definition to establish the date a policy claim is incurred under the developmental method 
under the original incurred date coding definition  prior to the end of the period in which a health policy claim was made  the company estimated and recorded a liability for the cost of all medical services related to the accident or sickness relating to the claim  even though the medical services associated with such accident or sickness might not be rendered to the insured until a later financial reporting period 
due to the continual favorable development in the company s reserve estimates and the anticipation of a future increase in this level of favorable development associated with the growth in business  the company undertook an analysis of the reserve estimation process 
the company believes that the developmental method is the standard methodology within the health insurance industry and therefore re evaluated the key assumptions utilized under this method 
with the aging of the older blocks of business  the original 
table of contents incurred date coding assumption was re examined 
this re examination resulted in the decision to utilize a new incurred date definition instead of the original incurred date definition for purposes of estimating claim liabilities for the sea division 
effective january   the company determined to utilize a new incurred date coding definition to establish incurred dates under the developmental method in the sea division 
under this new incurred date coding definition  a break in service of more than six months will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
in addition  under this new incurred date coding definition  claims for services provided more than thirty six months after the original incurred date will result in the establishment of a new incurred date for subsequent services 
this change in the incurred date definition assumption resulted in a reduction in the estimated claim liabilities at the sea division in the amount of million during the first quarter of the sea division also estimates various additional claim liabilities as appropriate 
the additional claim liabilities estimate liabilities for situations  such as excess pending claims inventory and disputed claims 
the group insurance division assigns incurred dates based on the date of service 
this definition estimates the liability for all medical services received by the insured prior to the end of the applicable financial period 
appropriate adjustments are made in the completion factors to account for pending claim inventory changes and contractual continuation of coverage beyond the end of the financial period 
set forth below is a summary of claim liabilities at each of december   and by business unit at december  in thousands self employed agency division group insurance division life insurance division other insurance subtotal reinsurance recoverable total claim liability 
table of contents activity in the claims liability is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands claims liability at beginning of year  net of related reinsurance recoverables add claims liability on acquired business incurred losses  net of reinsurance  occurring during current year prior years deduct payments for claims  net of reinsurance  occurring during current year prior years claims liability at end of year  net of related reinsurance recoverables set forth below is a summary of the claims liability development experience favorable unfavorable by business unit in the company s insurance segment for each of the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands self employed agency division group insurance division life insurance division other insurance total favorable the above table shows incurred losses developed in amounts less than originally anticipated due to better than expected experience on the health business in the sea division in  and the million of favorable experience in the sea division for includes the effect of the million decrease in claims liability due to the refinements made to the claims liability calculation million and changes in estimate described above million 
excluding the impact of these refinements  the favorable experience in in the claims liability was million 
as a percentage of total claim liabilities established for the sea division at december   and  the total favorable claims liability development experience for excluding the effects of the refinements discussed above  and was  and  respectively 
over time  the developmental method replaces anticipated experience with actual experience  resulting in an ongoing re estimation of the claims liability 
since the greatest degree of estimation is used for more recent periods  the most recent prior year is subject to the greatest change 
recent actual experience has produced lower levels of claims payment experience than originally expected 
the products of the group insurance division consisting of the company s student insurance business unit and the star hrg business unit consist principally of medical insurance 
in general  medical insurance 
table of contents business has a short tail  which means that a favorable development or unfavorable development shown for prior years relates primarily to actual experience in the most recent prior year 
the favorable development reflected in the group insurance division is from better than expected experience and is not unusual for a medical line of business 
the majority of the favorable development experienced for related to the star hrg business unit 
since the star hrg business was new to the company acquired in  an expected loss ratio was used to set the claims liability at december  the adverse experience for the life insurance division is attributable to its workers compensation business 
the life insurance division previously wrote workers compensation insurance and similar group accident coverage for employers in a limited geographical market 
in may  the company made the decision to terminate this operation  and all existing policies were terminated as the policies came up for renewal over the succeeding twelve months 
the closing of new and renewal business starting in july of had the effect of concentrating the claims experience into existing policies and eliminating any benefits that might accrue from improved underwriting of new business or liabilities released on newer claims that might settle more quickly 
the effect of closing a block of this type of business is difficult to estimate at the date of closing  due to the longer claims tail usually experienced with workers compensation  and the effect of the closure itself on that claims tail 
accounting for health policy acquisition costs the company incurs various costs in connection with the origination and initial issuance of its health insurance policies  including underwriting and policy issuance costs  costs associated with lead generation activities and distribution costs ie  sales commissions paid to agents 
the company defers those costs that vary with production 
the company defers commissions paid to agents and premium taxes with respect to the portion of health premium collected but not yet earned  and the company amortizes the deferred expense over the period as and when the premium is earned 
costs associated with generating sales leads with respect to the health business issued through the sea division are capitalized and amortized over a two year period  which approximates the average life of a policy 
for financial reporting purposes  underwriting and policy issuance costs which the company estimates are more fixed than variable with respect to health policies issued through the company s sea and group divisions are expensed as incurred 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to health policies sold through the company s sea division  commissions paid to agents with respect to first year policies are higher than commissions paid to agents with respect to policies in renewal years 
accordingly  during periods of increasing first year premium revenue such as occurred during  the sea division s overall operating profit margin will be negatively impacted by the higher commission expense associated with first year premium revenue 
the company monitors and assesses the recoverability of capitalized health policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets the company adopted statements and on january  in accordance with statement no 
 the company tested for goodwill impairment effective january  as a result of the transitional impairment testing  completed during the quarter ended june   the company determined that goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of academic management services corp 
ams and barron risk management services barron was impaired in the aggregate amount of million million net of tax 
the company reflected this impairment charge in its financial statements as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in accordance with statement no 
during and  the company sold ams and barron  respectively 
statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
the company has determined that it will review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as of november of each year or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period 
table of contents such determination was made 
the company s annual review in of the goodwill related to continuing operations indicated no impairment 
accounting for agent stock accumulation plans the company sponsors a series of stock accumulation plans the agent plans established for the benefit of the independent insurance agents and independent sales representatives associated with uga association field services  new united agency and cornerstone america 
the company has established a liability for future unvested benefits under the agent plans and adjusts the liability based on the market value of the company s common stock 
the accounting treatment of the company s agent plans will result in unpredictable stock based compensation charges  dependent upon fluctuations in the quoted price of uici common stock 
these unpredictable fluctuations in stock based compensation charges may result in material non cash fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
see discussion above included in the section captioned variable stock based compensation and note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments the company has classified its investments in securities with fixed maturities as available for sale 
investments in equity securities and securities with fixed maturities have been recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed quarterly to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
investments are reviewed quarterly or more frequently if certain indicators arise to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
management s review considers the following indicators of impairment fair value is significantly below cost  the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting a particular investment  the decline in fair value is attributable to specific conditions  such as conditions in an industry or in a geographic area  the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  downgrades by rating agencies from investment grade to non investment grade  the financial condition of the issuer has deteriorated and dividends have been reduced or eliminated or scheduled interest payments have not been made 
management monitors investments where two or more of the above indicators exist and investments are identified by the company in economically challenged industries 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
the company seeks to match the maturities of invested assets with the payment of expected liabilities 
by doing this  the company attempts to make cash available as payments become due 
if a significant mismatch of the maturities of assets and liabilities were to occur  the impact on the company s results of operations could be significant 
deferred taxes the company records deferred tax assets to reflect the impact of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets 
the company establishes a valuation allowance when management believes  based on the weight of the available evidence  that it is more likely than not that 
table of contents some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
during the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets  which related primarily to operating losses in prior years at the company s ams subsidiary 
accordingly  in  the company released and recognized as income the then remaining valuation allowance of million 
during the company realized million of net capital losses for federal tax purposes 
the capital losses were generated in from the sale of ams  healthaxis and seniorsfirst llc and were partially offset by the gain from the sale of a substantial portion of the company s equity stake in amli residential 
to the extent not utilized to offset capital gains generated in prior years  the net capital losses generated in will be carried forward to future years  with the ability to utilize the remaining capital losses in through during  the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets related to a portion of the capital loss carryforwards generated in accordingly  the company established a valuation allowance of million associated with the carryforwards at december  in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  the valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect its deferred tax assets at the amount that the company believes is more likely than not to be realized 
increasing the valuation allowance would result in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
the company will consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need to change the valuation allowance 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
loss contingencies the company is subject to proceedings and lawsuits related to insurance claims and other matters 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
privacy initiatives recently adopted legislation and regulations governing the use and security of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  may have a significant impact on the company s business and future results of operations 
gramm leach bliley act and state insurance laws and regulations the business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels 
the financial services modernization act of the so called gramm leach bliley act  or glba includes several privacy provisions and introduces new controls over the transfer and use of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities 
additional federal legislation aimed at protecting the privacy of nonpublic personal financial and health information is proposed and over state privacy bills are pending 
glba provides that there is no federal preemption of a state s insurance related privacy laws if the state law is more stringent than the privacy rules imposed under glba 
accordingly  state insurance regulators or 
table of contents state legislatures will likely adopt rules that will limit the ability of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities to disclose and use non public information about consumers to third parties 
these limitations will require the disclosure by these entities of their privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  will allow consumers to prevent the disclosure or use of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party 
pursuant to the authority granted under glba to state insurance regulatory authorities to regulate the privacy of nonpublic personal information provided to consumers and customers of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities  the national association of insurance commissioners has recently promulgated a new model regulation called privacy of consumer financial and health information regulation 
some states issued this model regulation before july   while other states must pass certain legislative reforms to implement new state privacy rules pursuant to glba 
in addition  glba requires state insurance regulators to establish standards for administrative  technical and physical safeguards pertaining to customer records and information to a ensure their security and confidentiality  b protect against anticipated threats and hazards to their security and integrity  and c protect against unauthorized access to and use of these records and information 
the privacy and security provisions of glba will significantly affect how a consumer s nonpublic personal information is transmitted through and used by diversified financial services companies and conveyed to and used by outside vendors and other unaffiliated third parties 
due to the increasing popularity of the internet  laws and regulations may be passed dealing with issues such as user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services  and those regulations could adversely affect the growth of the online financial services industry 
if internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns  increasing regulation or for other reasons  the growth of uici s internet based business would be hindered 
it is not possible at this time to assess the impact of the privacy provisions on uici s financial condition or results of operations 
health insurance portability and accountability act of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa contains provisions requiring mandatory standardization of certain communications between health plans including health insurance companies  electronic clearinghouses and health care providers who transmit certain health information electronically 
hipaa requires health plans to use specific data content standards  mandates the use of specific identifiers ie  national provider identifiers and national employer identifiers and requires specific privacy and security procedures 
hipaa authorized the secretary of the federal department of health and human services hhs to issue standards for the privacy and security of medical records and other individually identifiable patient data 
in december  hhs issued final regulations regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
this final rule on privacy applies to both electronic and paper records and imposes extensive requirements on the way in which health care providers  health plan sponsors  health insurance companies and their business associates use and disclose protected information 
under the new hipaa privacy rules  the company is required to a comply with a variety of requirements concerning its use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  b establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and c enter into business associate contracts with other companies that use similar privacy protection procedures 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but  rather  preempt all contrary state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
the company believes that it was in material compliance with the privacy requirements imposed by hipaa and the rules thereunder as of april   the date the rules became effective 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal penalties of up to  per violation and civil sanctions of up to  per violation 
due to the complex and controversial nature of the privacy regulations  they may be subject to court challenge  as well as further legislative and regulatory actions that could alter their effect 

table of contents in august  hhs published for comment proposed rules related to the security of electronic health data  including individual health information and medical records  for health plans  health care providers  and health care clearinghouses that maintain or transmit health information electronically 
the proposed rules would require these businesses to establish and maintain responsible and appropriate safeguards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of this information 
the standards embraced by these rules include the implementation of technical and organization policies  practices and procedures for security and confidentiality of health information and protecting its integrity  education and training programs  authentication of individuals who access this information  system controls  physical security and disaster recovery systems  protection of external communications and use of electronic signatures 
the final hipaa security rules were issued by the hhs in february  and the compliance date for hipaa covered entities is april  uici is currently reviewing the potential impact of the hipaa privacy and security regulations on its operations  including its information technology and security systems 
the company cannot at this time predict with specificity what impact the recently adopted final hipaa rules governing the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information may have on the business or results of operations of the company 
however  these new rules will likely increase the company s burden of regulatory compliance with respect to its life and health insurance products and other information based products  and may reduce the amount of information the company may disclose and use if the company s customers do not consent to such disclosure and use 
there can be no assurance that the restrictions and duties imposed by the recently adopted final rules on the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information will not have a material adverse effect on uici s business and future results of operations 
other matters the state of domicile of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries imposes minimum risk based capital requirements that were developed by the naic 
the formulas for determining the amount of risk based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances and premium levels based on the perceived degree of risk 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined  to its authorized control level risk based capital  as defined 
companies specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratios for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
dividends paid by domestic insurance companies out of earned surplus in any year are limited by the law of the state of domicile

inflation inflation historically has had a significant impact on the health insurance business 
in recent years  inflation in the costs of medical care covered by such insurance has exceeded the general rate of inflation 
under basic hospital medical insurance coverage  established ceilings for covered expenses limit the impact of inflation on the amount of claims paid 
under catastrophic hospital expense plans and preferred provider contracts  covered expenses are generally limited only by a maximum lifetime benefit and a maximum lifetime benefit per accident or sickness 
thus  inflation may have a significantly greater impact on the amount of claims paid under catastrophic hospital expense and preferred provider plans as compared to claims under basic hospital medical coverage 
as a result  trends in health care costs must be monitored and rates adjusted accordingly 
under the health insurance policies issued in the self employed market  the primary insurer generally has the right to increase rates upon days written notice and subject to regulatory approval in some cases 
the annuity and universal life type policies issued directly and assumed by the company are significantly impacted by inflation 
interest rates affect the amount of interest that existing policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
however  the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are 
table of contents generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size  and the investment portfolio is managed to minimize the effects of inflation

actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the following changes in general economic conditions  including the performance of financial markets  and interest rates  competitive  regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of or demand for the company s products  health care reform  the ability to predict and effectively manage claims related to health care costs  and reliance on key management and adequacy of claim liabilities 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs incurred on existing business and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 

table of contents changes in mandated benefits  utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
in addition  the company faces competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  implement underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in their states of domicile and the other states in which they do business under statutes that typically delegate broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments and agencies 
state insurance departments have also periodically conducted and continue to conduct financial and market conduct examinations and other inquiries of uici s insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory agencies have authority to levy monetary fines and penalties resulting from findings made during the course of such examinations and inquiries 
historically  the company s insurance subsidiaries have from time to time been subject to such regulatory fines and penalties 
while none of such fines or penalties individually or in the aggregate have to date had a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company  the company could be adversely affected by increases in regulatory fines or penalties and or changes in the scope  nature and or intensity of regulatory scrutiny and review

the agreements with these associations requiring the associations to continue as the master policyholder and to make available to their respective members the company s insurance products to their respective members are terminable by the company and the associations upon not less than one year s advance notice to the other party 
in december  the national association of insurance commissioners naic convened a special task force to review association group coverage  and the company is aware that selected states are reviewing the laws and regulations under which association group policies are issued

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments and the amount of interest that policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
the interest rate risk taken in the investment portfolio is managed relative to the duration of the liabilities 
the company s investment portfolio consists mainly of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in the primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in the future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term is defined as a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
duration on invested assets is adjusted to call  put and interest rate reset features 
the sensitivity analysis model produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in managing its market risk
