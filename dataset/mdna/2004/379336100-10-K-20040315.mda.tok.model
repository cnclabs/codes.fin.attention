item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
certain of the statements included below and in other portions of this annual report  including those regarding future financial performance or results that are not historical facts  are or contain forward looking information as that term is defined in the securities act of  as amended 
the words expect  believe  anticipate  project  estimate  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we caution readers that any such statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and such statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expected include  but are not limited to  dependence on the oil and gas industry and industry conditions  general economic conditions including interest rates and inflation  competition  our ability to continue our acquisition strategy  successfully manage our growth  and obtain funds to finance our growth  operating risks  contract bidding risks  the use of estimates for revenue recognition  risks of international operations  risks of vessel construction such as cost overruns  changes in government regulations  and disputes with construction contractors  dependence on key personnel and the availability of skilled workers during periods of strong demand  availability of project materials during periods of strong demand  the impact of regulatory and environmental laws  the ability to obtain insurance  and other factors discussed below 
operating risks include hazards such as vessel capsizing  sinking  grounding  colliding  and sustaining damage in severe weather conditions  fire and explosion 
these hazards can also cause personal injury  loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution and environmental damage  and suspension of operations 
the risks inherent with international operations include polit ical  social  and economic instability  exchange rate fluctuations  currency restrictions  nullification  modification  or renegotiations of contracts  potential vessel seizure  nationalization of assets  import export quotas  and other forms of public and governmental regulation 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements 
results of operations overview our results of operations reflect the level of offshore construction activity in the gulf of mexico and the international locations in which we operate 
the results also reflect our ability to win jobs through competitive bidding and manage awarded jobs to successful completion 
the level of offshore construction activity is principally determined by three factors first  the oil and gas industry s ability to economically justify placing discoveries of oil and gas reserves in production  second  the oil and gas industry s need to clear all structures from the lease once the oil and gas reserves have been depleted  and third  weather events such as major hurricanes 
we conduct our operations through two divisions  offshore construction ocd and global divers and marine contractors gdmc 
ocd includes all pipelay except shallow water gulf of mexico and derrick lifts 
gdmc includes all diving and marine support services worldwide and gulf of mexico shallow water pipelay 
our results of operations for our ocd and gdmc divisions depend heavily on obtaining a sufficient quantity of offshore construction contracts with sufficient gross profit margins 
contract bidding is very competitive and in the recent past has resulted in contractors willing to assume greater amounts of risk  for no additional or reduced pricing  in order to be awarded the contract 
as a result  contract margins have eroded throughout the industry 
however  recent trends indicate a decreased contractor tolerance for uncompensated risk 
most of our ocd revenue is obtained through larger more complex contracts that are longer in duration and require significant amounts of working capital 
most of these contracts are bid on a lump sum basis and are secured by a letter of credit or performance bond  which insures proper completion 
these contracts are inherently risky and are subject to many unforeseen circumstances and events that may affect productivity 
as productivity decreases  with no offsetting decrease in costs or increases in revenue  contract margins erode as compared to our bid margins 
as a result  our ocd revenues and margins are subject to a high degree of variability 
our competition and inherent operating risks vary in every area of the world in which we operate which effects individual segment profitability 
recently  inherent operating risks have been greater in our west africa ocd division 
due to the nature of ocd contracts and adding to the degree of project execution difficulty  changes in the scope of the base contract sometimes occur as contract work progresses 
a change order usually increases the scope of work  but may also decrease the scope and  consequently  the contract revenue and costs 
either the customer or we may initiate change orders 
at the time of initiation  change orders may be approved or unapproved by either party  priced or unpriced  and or defined or undefined regarding detailed scope 
quite often  although the scope of work is defined  the associated increase or decrease in contract revenue will be governed by contract terms or negotiated later  sometimes after the work is performed 
we recognize these change orders as revenue in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states 
see significant accounting policies and estimates 
most gdmc revenues are short term in nature  involve numerous smaller contracts  and are usually based on a day rate charge 
financial risks associated with these types of contracts are normally limited due to their short term and non lump sum nature 
revenues and margins in our gdmc division tend to be more consistent than in our ocd division 
our results reflect a difficult year in which both our revenues and our results declined 
the decline in revenues can be primarily attributed to reduced activity in our ocd latin america segment and in our gdmc division 
our results reflect not only reduced activity but also significant deterioration in gross profit margins primarily due to poor productivity on several large contracts  as well as weather delays in projects that increased our costs 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax provision related to an adverse ruling by the paris commercial court in the long standing litigation between groupe gtm now vinci and us 
this litigation related to the termination of the share purchase agreement pursuant to which we were to have acquired etpm  sa a subsidiary of groupe gtm 
we are currently appealing this verdict in the cour d appel de paris 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our management structure  and effective january   we reorganized our operating management structure and our existing business lines 
these changes were made to adapt to certain marketplace conditions in our domestic and international operations 
in conjunction with the reorganization  we eliminated non core and under performing assets relating to certain of our marine assets and support facilities and recorded a one time pretax non cash charge of million associated with these assets 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues

the decrease in revenues from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in our global divers and marine contractors division 
in our global divers and marine contractors division activity and pricing decreased as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in revenues in our global divers and marine contractors division was partially offset by increased revenues in our offshore construction division due primarily to increased utilization 
major construction barge utilization in our offshore construction division was in compared with utilization in activity in our offshore construction division s gulf of mexico and middle east segments increased dramatically but was partially offset by a significant decline in activity in latin america 
for a detailed discussion of revenues in each division and geographic area  see segment information overview 
gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit from to was attributable to decreased activity in our latin america segments  which provided favorable contract margins in  reduced productivity and increased costs on pipeline contracts in our offshore construction division s west africa segment including the misappropriation of our funds by an indigenous import export agent and in our offshore construction division s gulf of mexico segment including a work stoppage by workers of a welding subcontractor 
productivity and efficiency decreases  with no offsetting decrease in costs or increase in revenues  resulted in reduced contract margins 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit declined to in compared to for operating loss 
the increase in our operating loss from to was primarily attributable to the decline in gross profit described above and the recording of a provision of million pre tax related to the adverse ruling in the long standing litigation with vinci groupe gtm 
for additional information regarding the gtm litigation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
gains on asset disposals increased million due primarily to a million pretax gain from the sale of two construction barges the sara maria and mohawk in our offshore construction division s latin america segment in gains on asset disposals in primarily relate to an insurance settlement gain on one vessel in our global divers and marine contractors division s gulf of mexico segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses were unchanged from to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of dry docking costs  for decreased to million compared to the million recorded in the decline was due primarily to the existence of a million charge in relating to a charge for unamortized term loan origination fees due to the early repayment of our term loan facility and a decrease in the utilization of certain of our offshore construction division s gulf of mexico segment pipelay derrick barges that carry a high depreciable basis and are depreciated on a units of production basis 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million for of this decrease  is attributable to lower interest rates and is attributable to lower average outstanding debt levels 
other expense income 
the decline in other expenses is primarily due to reduced exchange rate losses in net loss 
the increase in our net loss was the result of the factors described above that reduced our gross profit and operating income 
our effective tax rate is in compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the following the reduction in earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions that are taxed on a deemed profits  percentage of revenue  basis  net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions that have not been tax benefited  and a million tax expense attributable to the establishment of a valuation allowance for a capital loss carry forward previously anticipated to be utilized by segment information overview 
we conformed our segment reporting to changes in our operating management structure and existing business lines that were effective january  our new reportable segments include two divisions  the offshore construction division and the global divers and marine contractors division  each with five reportable segments 
the offshore construction division includes all pipelay except shallow water gulf of mexico and derrick lifts 
the global divers and marine contractors division includes all diving and marine support services worldwide  and gulf of mexico shallow water pipelay 
we have identified ten reportable segments as required by sfas total revenues in our offshore construction division increased slightly to million in from million in but results were adversely affected as this division s loss before taxes increased from million in to million in this decline  which was partially offset by the existence of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  was primarily due to the following productivity losses on several significant projects in our west africa segment resulting in significant project losses  misappropriation of our funds by an indigenous import export agent on a project in west africa  productivity losses on two significant projects due to inclement weather and subcontractor work stoppages in the gulf of mexico resulting in significant project margin deterioration  and reduced activity in the latin america segment  which historically maintains favorable contract margins 
although total revenues from our global divers and marine contractors division declined million or to million including million intersegment revenues in from million including million intersegment revenues in  this division s results increased substantially from a loss before taxes of million in to income before taxes of million in revenues declined due to reduced activity and pricing 
excluding the effects of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before taxes decreased million or due to decreased activity and pricing 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of our reportable segments during and for additional information concerning the financial results of each segment  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
offshore construction division gulf of mexico revenues increased to million including million intersegment revenues for from million including million intersegment revenues for due primarily to work performed on two large contracts  one of which had a large amount of procurement and subcontractor content 
vessel utilization increased to for from for the prior year 
loss before income taxes decreased by million  or  to a loss before income taxes of million for from a loss before income taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  loss before taxes decreased million due primarily to the increased activity and the transfer of two vessels to our middle east ocd segment in  partially offset by losses on one contract related to inclement weather conditions and reduced prod uctivity on another project due to a work stoppage by some employees of our welding subcontractor 
west africa revenues increased to million for compared to million for the increase in revenues was due to three large pipeline projects in process during each of these projects was negatively impacted during by reduced efficiencies as well as mechanical and weather downtime and significant contractual disputes 
in addition  in april we discovered that million of our funds was misappropriated by an indigenous import export agent on one project 
as a result of these issues  the loss before taxes increased million to million for compared to million for latin america revenues decreased to million for from million for due primarily to decreased activity during moreover  included two large projects 
income before taxes decreased million to a loss before taxes of million for compared to income before taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before taxes decreased million to a loss as a result of decreased activity partially offset by the sale of two construction barges in the third quarter of that resulted in a gain of million 
asia pacific revenues increased to million for compared to million for income before taxes increased million to million compared to a loss before taxes of million for the increase in revenues is due primarily to increased activity 
excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before taxes increased by million or due primarily to increased activity partially offset by the changes in mix of contract work 
middle east revenues increased significantly to million for compared to million for due primarily to one large project in low net margins on this contract were due to reduced efficiencies in our operations and idle equipment costs 
income before taxes increased million  or  to million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for global divers and marine contractors division gulf of mexico revenues decreased to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due to a decrease in vessel utilization and a reduction in pricing 
income before taxes increased by million  or  to million for compared to income before taxes of million for excluding the effects of two unusual events in the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in and the gain on an insurance settlement in income before taxes decreased million or in due to the decreased vessel utilization and reduced pricing 
west africa due to increased activity  revenues  all of which were intersegment revenues  increased to million for from million for the year ended december  income before taxes  however  increased only million to million for compared to income before taxes of million for the increase in income before taxes was due primarily to the increased activity substantially offset by decreased productivity resulting in project margin deterioration 
latin america revenues decreased significantly to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due primarily to the failure to replace the work performed on two large projects in income before taxes also decreased for to a loss before taxes of million compared to income before taxes of million for revenues at current levels were insufficient to cover certain fixed costs resulting in a loss before tax 
asia pacific revenues decreased to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due to decreased activity 
the loss before taxes decreased significantly  however  to million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  loss before taxes increased million due to decreased activity 
middle east revenues increased to million for compared to million for due to increased activity 
income before taxes increased to million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for excluding the effects of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before taxes increased million as a result of increased activity in year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  percentage change in millions revenues cost of operations gross profit goodwill amortization losses on asset disposal and impairment net gains on asset disposal selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss other expense income interest expense other income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss not meaningful revenues 
the increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased activity in certain areas including our offshore construction division s west africa and latin america segments  partially offset by a decrease in activity in our offshore construction division s gulf of mexico and asia pacific segments and decreased activity and lower pricing in the global divers and marine contractors division gulf of mexico segment 
major construction barge utilization in our offshore construction division was in and gross profit 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of decreased activity and or pricing in our offshore construction division and global divers and marine contractors division gulf of mexico segments  a lower margin on a large epic contract in our offshore construction division west africa segment  and lower than expected productivity associated with three other projects  partially offset by increased activity in our offshore construction division s latin america segment and a different mix of contract work in our offshore construction division s asia pacific segment 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit for was compared to for losses on asset disposal and impairment 
effective january  we reorganized our operating management structure and existing business lines  offshore construction and installation and diving  to focus on core operations and specialized markets 
we made these changes to adapt to certain marketplace conditions in our domestic and international operations 
in conjunction with the reorganization  we eliminated non core and under performing assets relating to certain of our marine assets and support facilities 
we recorded a one time pretax non cash charge of million in december associated with these assets 
operating income loss 
our operating loss of million was primarily the result of the million non cash charge in december  the decline in gross profits and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by gains on asset disposals 
gains on asset disposals increased million due primarily to an insurance settlement gain on one vessel in our global divers and marine contractors division s gulf of mexico segment in in  a gain of million was recorded related to the disposal of one vessel in our global divers and marine contractors division s gulf of mexico segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to increased bad debt expense in our offshore construction division and global divers and marine contractors gulf of mexico segments and asia pacific segments  increased costs associated with corporate travel  and costs related to project management enh ancements and increased costs in our offshore construction division s latin america segment related to the increase in activity 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including amortization of dry docking costs  for was million compared to the million recorded in the increase was principally attributable to increased utilization of our pipelay derrick barges  which are depreciated on a units of production basis  in latin america  gulf of mexico offshore construction  asia pacific  and west africa segments 
the increase was partially offset by the cessation of goodwill amortization beginning january   in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill for was million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million for of this decrease is attributable to lower interest rates and attributable to lower average outstanding debt levels due primarily to the use of proceeds from an equity sale to repay indebtedness 
other expense income 
other expense increased million due primarily to increased exchange rate losses in net income loss 
our net loss for was primarily the result of the factors described above that reduced our gross profit and created a significant operating loss partially offset by a significant decrease in interest expense and a million tax benefit recorded 
our effective tax rate for was compared to for the reduction in the effective tax rate is due primarily to the one time non cash charge that we recorded in and its effects on taxable income in differing taxable jurisdictions 
segment information overview 
we conformed our segment reporting to changes in our operating management structure and existing business lines that were effective january  we have identified ten reportable segments as required by sfas total revenues in our offshore construction division increased in  however  profitability declined and was adversely affected as this division s loss before income taxes more than tripled to million in from million in the decline in results was primarily due to productivity losses on one significant project in our west africa segment  and the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge 
total revenues from our global divers and marine contractors declined to million including million intersegment revenues in from million including million intersegment revenues in but this division s loss before income taxes increased almost four times due to the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge 
the following discusses the results of operations for each of those reportable segments during the years of and for additional information concerning the financial results of each segment see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
offshore construction division gulf of mexico this segment s gross revenues decreased to million including million intersegment revenues for compared to million including million intersegment revenues for due to decreased activity 
the loss before income taxes increased by million to million for from a loss before income taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  loss before taxes increased million due primarily to decreased activity  partially offset by the shifting of costs related to certain gulf of mexico construction vessels working in our latin american segment 
west africa revenues increased to million in from million for the increase in revenues was due to increased activity primarily for work performed on one large epic contract  which had a large amount of procurement and subcontract content 
results declined million to a loss before income taxes of million for from income before income taxes of million for due primarily to poor performance on one large epic contract associated with an indigenous subcontractor 
latin america revenues increased to million in from million for due primarily to work performed on two large contracts  one of which had a large amount of procurement and subcontractor content 
income before income taxes increased million to million for from a loss before income taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before income taxes increased million due to the increased activity 
asia pacific revenues decreased million to million for from million for loss before income taxes increased by million to million for from income before income taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before income tax decreased million due to decreased activity partially offset by changes in the mix of contract work  improved pricing  and better project execution as compared to middle east revenues increased million to million for as a result of increased activity 
results declined by million to a loss before income taxes of million for from a loss before income taxes of million for global divers and marine contractors division gulf of mexico revenues decreased million to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due to decreased vessel utilization and reduced pricing 
income before taxes decreased by million to million for compared to income before taxes of million for excluding the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in and the million gain on an insurance settlement in  income before taxes decreased million in due to decreased vessel utilization and reduced pricing 
west africa revenues  all of which were intersegment revenues  increased to million for the from million for income before taxes increased million to million for compared to income before taxes of million for the increase in revenues and income before taxes were due primarily to increased activity 
latin america revenues increased million to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due primarily to work performed on two large high margin projects in income before taxes also increased to million for compared to income before taxes of million for asia pacific revenues increased to million including million of intersegment revenues for from million including million of intersegment revenues for due to increased activity 
the loss before taxes was million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for excluding the million of disposal and impairment costs associated with the one time non cash charge in  income before tax increased million due to increased activity and the mix of contract work 
middle east revenues decreased to million for compared to million for due to decreased activity 
loss before taxes increased to million for compared to a loss before taxes of million for excluding the effect of the million of disposal and impairment cost associated with the one time non cash charge in  loss before taxes decreased by million due to the mix of contract work partially offset by decreased activity in liquidity and capital resources overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets particularly for the enhancement and acquisition of vessels and funding working capital and losses from operations and repayment of debt 
cash to fund needs of our business has been provided primarily by operations  debt financing and equity issuances 
although our backlog decreased to million at the end of from million at the end of  we expect activity levels to be increasing over the next twelve to eighteen months 
as of february   we have been awarded over million in projects since the end of the increase in activity will require working capital increases 
we have recently entered into a new credit facility to provide for the funding of this anticipated increase in working capital needs in advance of increases in our cash flows from operations 
in addition  the recent judgment against us in the vinci groupe gtm litigation may require a substantial cash payment pending our appeal of the judgment 
capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million 
cash flow our cash balance decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  because our operations failed to provide sufficient cash flow to fund operations and investing activity 
during  our operations used million of cash compared to generating cash flow of million in primarily due to our significantly larger net loss 
our cash outflow for operating expenses were greater than our cash inflows from operating revenues due primarily to our large net loss in cash and proceeds from the sale of assets funded investing activities of million 
investing activities consisted principally of capital expenditures  dry docking costs  and sales of assets 
working capital decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital is due to a decrease in accounts receivable and cash  an increase in other accrued liabilities related principally to the million vinci groupe gtm litigation provision  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
working capital is anticipated to increase as activity increases 
at december   our backlog was million  as compared to a backlog of million at december  approximately of the backlog is expected to be performed during the remainder of our capital expenditures during the year ended december  totaled million which was used primarily for vessel improvements 
we estimate that the cost to complete capital expenditure projects in progress at december  will be approximately million  all of which is expected to be incurred during the next twelve months 
these projects are primarily related to vessel upgrades 
as of december   we had purchased million shares of our common stock since the inception of our million stock repurchase program at a total cost of million 
during  we did not repurchase any shares 
during  we repurchased an aggregate of million shares of stock for a total of million 
our new credit facility described below limits stock repurchases 
long term debt long term debt outstanding at december  including current maturities includes million of title xi bonds and million drawn against our prior bank credit facility discussed below 
on march   we entered into a new million revolving credit facility replacing the previous million loan facility that would have matured december the entire facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit  and million will be available for direct cash advances 
the new facility matures on march  this revolving credit facility permits borrowings based on prime rate and london interbank offered rate libor in each case plus a floating spread 
the spreads can range from to and to for prime rate and libor based borrowings  respectively  based upon certain financial ratios 
in addition  the new credit facility allows for certain fixed rate interest options on amounts outstanding 
stock of our subsidiaries  certain real estate  and the majority of our vessels collateralize the loans under the new credit facility 
this facility is subject to certain financial covenants 
we must maintain minimum levels of intangible net worth and earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation amortization  not exceed levels of debt and capital expenditures specified in the agreement  and comply with  among other things  an interest coverage ratio and a leverage ratio 
these covenants may limit our capacity and financial flexibility 
see risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report 
in consideration for this agreement  we paid a million fee 
as of march   we had million of borrowings and million of credit availability under our new revolving credit facility 
prior to march   we maintained a million revolving credit facility 
this facility was scheduled to mature on december  the facility permitted both prime rate bank borrowings and libor borrowings plus a floating spread 
stock of our subsidiaries  certain real estate  and the majority of our vessels collateralized the loans under the credit facility 
on march  we terminated and replaced this facility with our new credit facility 
effective december   we amended our prior credit facility due to anticipated non compliance with the leverage ratio covenant  the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  and the minimum net worth covenant for the quarter ended december  the amendment reduced the requirements for both ratio covenants 
no cash fee was paid for this amendment  but interest rates were increased 
the spread ranges increased to to for prime rate borrowings and to for libor based borrowings from to and to for prime rate and libor based borrowings respectively 
at december   we were in compliance with this credit facility and all financial covenants  as amended 
effective june   we amended our prior credit facility due to anticipated non compliance with the leverage ratio covenant for the quarter ending june  and the next three quarters 
the amendment reduced the requirements of the leverage ratio covenant for the quarters ending june  through december  in consideration for this amendment  we paid a fee of million 
our title xi bonds mature in   and the bonds carry interest rates of   and per annum  respectively  and require aggregate semi annual payments of million  plus interest 
the agreements pursuant to which the title xi bonds were issued contain certain covenants  including the maintenance of minimum working capital and net worth requirements 
if not met  additional covenants result that restrict our operations and our ability to pay cash dividends 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
other indebtedness and obligations we also have a million short term credit facility at one of our foreign locations which is secured by a letter of credit 
additionally  in the normal course of business  we provide guarantees and performance  bid  and payment bonds pursuant to agreements  or in connection with bidding to obtain such agreements to perform construction services 
all of these guarantees are secured by parent company guarantees 
the aggregate of these guarantees and bonds at december  was million in surety bonds and million in bank guarantees letters of credit 
the surety bonds and bank guarantees letters of credit expire between january and october and between february and december  respectively 
in august  we renegotiated our april long term charter of the titan  a foot self propelled twin hulled derrick ship to provide improved vessel staffing and maintenance flexibility 
the new vessel charter payments are expected to be approximately million annually 
in april  we prepaid million of charter payments  which will continue to be systematically applied to future charter payments 
the new charter term is months expiring august this charter can be canceled by us at anytime  subject to a termination penalty of the transfer to the vessel owner of title to our dynamic positioning dp system used on the vessel 
the dp system was purchased and installed on the titan at our cost in the first quarter of for a total cost of million 
minimum rental commitments under leases having an initial or remaining non cancelable term in excess of one year for each of the five years following december  and in total thereafter follow in thousands thereafter total summary of contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations cancelable operating lease obligations non cancelable purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total represents the titan lease liquidity outlook we expect funds available under our new credit facility  available cash  and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to fund our operations including the anticipated increase in working capital required to fund increasing activity  scheduled debt retirement  planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months  as well as required payments related to the vinci groupe gtm judgment 
in addition  as we have in the recent past  we will also continue to evaluate the divesture of vessels which are no longer critical to our operations in order to reduce our operating costs and debt levels 
over the longer term we expect cash from operations  supplemented by equity financings and proceeds from long term debt  to provide sufficient funds to operate and expand our business and maintain our fleet 
for flexibility  we maintain a shelf registration statement that as of march  permits the issuance of up to million of debt and equity securities 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of equipment or businesses  which may require additional liquidity 
industry and business outlook activity increased in six out of ten of our segments in as compared to however  activity in our latin america segment declined dramatically 
we have been experiencing a marked increase in bidding activity for near term and long term projects 
bidding activity in latin america has increased substantially with awarded work to be performed in and subsequent to december   we have been awarded over million of new work in our latin america ocd segment 
activity is expected to decline in our gulf of mexico and west africa segments and remain constant in our asia pacific segments 
based on our bid activity and other factors  we are expecting overall activity to improve in new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires the recording of liabilities for all legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the normal operation of those assets 
these liabilities are required to be recorded at their fair values which are likely to be the present values of the estimated future cash flows in the period in which they are incurred 
sfas no 
requires the associated asset retirement costs to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the asset retirement obligation will be accreted each year through a charge to expense 
the amounts added to the carrying amounts of the assets will be depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
we implemented sfas no 
on january  this implementation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operati ons 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estim ates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from construction contracts  which are typically of short duration  are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the current estimated total cost of the respective contract 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect vessel costs  labor  supplies  and repairs 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
significant changes in cost estimates due to adverse market conditions or poor contract performance could affect estimated gross profit  possibly resulting in a contract loss 
moreover  adjustments  if any  are reflected in income in the period when any adjustment is determined 
to the ex tent that an adjustment results in a reduction of previously reported profits  we could recognize a charge against current earnings to reflect the adjustment 
in addition  we include claims and unapproved change orders to the extent of costs incurred in contract revenues when the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim  additional costs are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  costs are identifiable and  evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
accounts receivable our accounts receivables include both billed and unbilled receivables 
these receivables often include claims and unapproved change orders 
the claims and unapproved change orders included in accounts receivable and unbilled receivables  amounted to million at december  and million at december  unbilled retainage at december  was million and is expected to be billed in unbilled retainage at december  was million 
we continually monitor our receivables for collectability and make the appropriate allowances when deemed necessary 
historically we have not experienced any significant losses on receivables 
property and equipment long lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying values can be recovered through projected net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges  based on expected operating results over their remaining lives 
future adverse market conditions or poor operating results could result in the inability to recover the current carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes at december   we had an available net operating loss nol carryforward for regular us federal income tax and foreign jurisdiction purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which  if not used  will expire between and we also have a capital loss carryforward of million which  if not utilized  will expire in we believe that it is more likely than not that all of the nol will be utilized prior to their expiration 
a valuation allowance has been established for the capital loss carryforward as we do not believe that it will be utilized prior to its expiration 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the risk of changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
in we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which effectively modified the interest characteristics of million of our outstanding long term debt 
the agreement involved the exchange of a variable interest rate of libor plus for amounts based on fixed interest rates of plus 
the swap matured in may the transaction was entered into in the normal course of business primarily to hedge rising interest rates 
interest on approximately million  or of our long term debt with a weighted average interest rate of at december   was variable  based on short term market rates 
thus  a general increase of in short term market interest rates would result in additional interest cost of million per year if we were to maintain the same debt level and structure 
also  we have approximately million fixed interest rate long term debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a market value of approximately million on december  a general increase of in overall market interest rates would result in a decline in market value of the debt to approximately million 
we use natural hedging techniques to hedge against foreign currency exchange losses by contracting  to the extent possible  international construction jobs to be payable in us dollars 
we also  to the extent possible  maintain cash balances at foreign locations in us dollar accounts 
we do not believe that a change in currency rates in the regions in which we operate would have a significant effect on our results of operations
