item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with forward looking statements this and other sections of this annual report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
these statements include  but are not limited to  statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses  planned asset dispositions  disposition pricing  and planned acquisition and developments 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and  therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included in this report on form k will prove to be accurate 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking statements included herein  the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved 
the following are risks that the company believes could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors beyond its control the company s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends  and or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing 
funds from operations and the value of the company s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the company s control 
such events or conditions could include competition from other apartment communities  overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in the company s markets  which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and or require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units  increases in operating costs including real estate taxes and insurance premiums due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset by increased rents  the company s inability to rent apartments on favorable economic terms  changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance  changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing  which could lead renters to purchase homes if interest rates drop and home loans are more readily available or increase the company s acquisition and operating costs if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available  weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing  decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the company s joint ventures  and the relative illiquidity of real estate investments 
currently  the company relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate 
any decline in the company s funds from operations or property values because of these factors which are beyond its control could adversely affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the company s stock price 
debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and operating results at december   the company had total debt outstanding of million 
payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the company with insufficient cash resources to operate the communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the company to maintain its qualification as a reit 
the company currently intends to limit its total debt to around of the undepreciated book value of its assets  although the company s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt levels 
circumstances may cause the company to exceed that target from time to time 
as of december   the company s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 
the company s board of directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  the company must repay its debt upon maturity  and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the company s financial condition and or its funds from operations 
variable interest rates may adversely affect our funds from operations at december   effectively million of the company s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was unhedged and uncapped 
in addition  the company may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates 
variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase  which would adversely affect the company s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders 
the company s million secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital  credit enhanced by fannie mae  is predominately a floating rate facility  the interest rates on which have been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps 
upon the termination of these swaps and caps  the company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates 
increasing insurance costs may negatively impact financial condition because the company has substantial real estate holdings  the cost of insuring its communities is a significant component of expense 
premiums for property and casualty insurance have risen significantly in recent years 
if the cost of property and casualty insurance continues to rise  its cost of doing business would likely rise  which may in turn negatively impact the company s financial condition and its ability to pay its dividend 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under different future conditions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  in that they require the most subjective judgments  form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical 
these critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  and fair value of derivative financial instruments 
capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets the company carries its real estate assets at their depreciated cost 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years for land improvements and buildings  to years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment  and years for computers  all of which are judgmental determinations 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements  renovations  and replacements are capitalized 
the cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the company in order to elevate the condition of the property to the company s standards are capitalized as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
the company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the company s fiscal fourth quarter  or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance  market conditions  and legal factors 
to evaluate goodwill and long lived assets for impairment  the company estimates future operating cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset s fair value 
in the apartment industry  the primary method used for determining fair values is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate 
the company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in the community s market or submarket 
fair value of derivative financial instruments the company utilizes certain derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  during the normal course of business to manage  or hedge  the interest rate risk associated with the company s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction 
the valuation of the derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedging instrument  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective 
the company performs effectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter  through the term of the hedging instruments 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings 
the fair value of the hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
while the company s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations  the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been highly related 
overview of the year ended december  the company s operating results for were impacted by continued economic weakness 
the company believes that the primary factor impacting demand for its apartments is job formation  which was slightly negative or static in most of the company s markets during this reduced the occupancy of its apartments  affected its ability to grow rents  and increased the amount of concessions that it had to offer to attract residents 
advertising and marketing expenditures also had to be increased to attract new residents 
the company regards single family housing as the primary competition for its existing residents  and low interest rates that existed throughout the year allowed its residents to purchase homes and impacted the company s occupancy rates 
the company began to see some improvement in the fourth quarter and expects operations to improve as the economy improves 
offsetting the impact to operations  the company was able to continue its debt refinancing strategy and take advantage of the low interest rate environment by reducing the interest rates on its variable rate debt 
as a result  the company was able to lower its average interest rate and experienced interest expense savings 
the company was also able to lower the dividend payments on its preferred stock by redeeming the preferred series a  b c and issuing a new series of preferred stock  series h at a lower yield 
the company achieved external growth during by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid sized growing markets in the southeastern united states and in texas 
the company made acquisitions both directly and through a joint venture partnership with crow holdings 
the company also purchased the share of its joint venture owned by blackstone real estate advisors that was formed in the company funded part of these purchases through some selective direct sales of shares of common stock 
the financings and acquisitions made during helped the company continue its strategy of improving the flexibility of its balance sheet and enhancing its ability to strengthen its dividend coverage 
the following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
as of december   the total number of apartment units the company owned or had an ownership interest in  including the properties owned by the company s joint ventures was  in communities  compared to the  apartment units in communities owned at december   and the  apartment units in communities owned at december  for properties owned by the company  the average monthly rental per apartment unit  excluding units in lease up  increased to at december  from at december  and at december  for these same units  overall occupancy at december   and was   and  respectively

for the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and insurance settlement proceeds totaling  primarily related to the disposition of two properties during the year 
in and  the company refinanced several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment 
this resulted in a loss of approximately  due to the early extinguishment of debt in and approximately  in as a result of the foregoing  net income decreased by  in over funds from operations funds from operations ffo represents net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap excluding extraordinary items  minority interest in operating partnership income  gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations and insurance settlement proceeds  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate  and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
this definition of ffo is in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trust s nareit recommended definition 
the company s policy is to expense the cost of interior painting  vinyl flooring  and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties 
during the stabilization period for acquisition properties  these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties  and  thus are not deducted in calculating ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating  investing  and financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes that ffo is helpful in understanding the company s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets 
the company believes that gaap historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets  whose value does not diminish predictably over time  as historical cost depreciation implies 
the company s calculation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the following table is a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the three years ended december   and dollars and shares in thousands years ended december  net income preferred dividend distribution premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred stock net income loss available for common shareholders depreciation and amortization real estate assets depreciation and amortization real estate assets of unconsolidated entities minority interest in operating partnership income net gain on insurance settlement proceeds and disposition of assets gain loss on sale of non depreciable assets depreciation and amortization real estate assets of discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued operations funds from operations weighted average shares and units basic diluted net income increased during by approximately  to  versus  in  principally because of reduced interest expenses  a  gain on the sale of the crossings apartments which is classified as a discontinued operation and  net gain on insurance settlement proceeds which were only partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization from acquisitions

trends property performance over the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the company s markets 
the recent economic downturn and the related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units  while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with historical averages 
the recent economic environment has impacted demand in two main ways producing lower job growth  which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the company s markets  and producing lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing  prompting more renters to purchase homes 
on the supply side  the declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the company s markets  especially in the larger metropolitan markets 
delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition  adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a number of the company s markets 
as part of its strategy to create continued stable and growing performance  the company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets  mid sized markets  and smaller tier markets  as defined by population levels 
during the recent economic downturn  the company s smaller tier and mid sized markets produced more stable performance  while it s larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances 
the company is beginning to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets  which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment 
as the economic environment improves  the company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates  which should combine to increase the number of apartment renters 
the company expects that this increase in demand will generate stronger property performance across the company s portfolio 
the company s large tier markets  which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn  should begin to absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels  while the company s smaller tier and mid sized markets would benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth 
over the long term  general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners  as immigration growth  combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the echo boomers children of the baby boomers is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years 
the company believes its portfolio location throughout the southeast and south central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic trends 
liquidity and capital resources net cash flow provided by operating activities remained relatively stable at  for compared to  for net cash used in investing activities grew during to  from  in this increase was primarily due to i the purchase of legacy pines for  green oaks for  the partnership interest in our joint venture with blackstone for  los rios park for  and lighthouse court for  compared to one acquisition of preston hills in for  and ii in dispositions totaled  including the transfer of a interest in green oaks to ch realty for  compared to dispositions of  in capital improvements to stabilized properties during the and totaled  and  respectively

in  the company negotiated an increase from million to million in the borrowing capacity of its existing secured credit facility with prudential mortgage capital  credit enhanced by fannie mae the fnma facility 
the expanded capacity may be utilized only as additional collateral is pledged to secure the facility 
at december  the fnma facility had an outstanding balance of million with an available borrowing base capacity of million 
million of the fnma facility expires in  renewable for two successive year terms  million expires in  and the remaining amount expires in  both renewable for a year term 
the company plans to utilize the additional facility capacity to refinance debt maturities over the next months 
the fnma facility provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the interest rate on the variable portion renews every days and is based on the fnma discount mortgage backed security dmbs rate on the date of renewal  which has typically approximated three month libor less an average spread of  plus a credit enhancement fee of to based on the outstanding borrowings 
the variable interest rate at december  was on variable rate borrowings of million 
fixed rate borrowings under the fnma facility totaled million at december   at interest rates inclusive of credit enhancement fees from to  and maturities from to compass bank provides an unsecured credit facility to the company 
outstanding borrowings under this facility at december  were million at a rate of 
the company currently maintains a million secured credit facility with two banks led by amsouth bank 
there was no outstanding balance under this facility at december  available borrowing base capacity under this facility was million at december  each of the company s credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage including the maintenance of certain financial ratios the total amount of credit which is made available is governed by lender formulas defining asset valuation 
if the company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing  the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn  which could adversely affect the company s liquidity 
moreover  if the company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility  after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default  accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and or foreclose on properties securing such facilities which may cause the company to be declared in default by its other lenders 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company 
at december   the company had a promissory note with union planters national bank union planters for million at a variable rate of 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk 
the company has nine interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of million which have variable legs based on one or three month libor  and fixed legs with an average rate of 
the swaps have expirations between and  and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the company s designated variable rate borrowings of its fnma facility 
the company has designed these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges on its fnma facility 
through the use of these swaps the company believes it has effectively fixed the borrowing rate during these periods of million of variable rate borrowings issued through the fnma facility  leaving only million of the fnma facility of which the interest rate has not been fixed or hedged 
the company also has a million tax free bond facility with fnma 
the company has five interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million which have variable legs based on the bma municipal swap index and fixed legs with an average rate of 
these swaps expire in and  and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the designated borrowings of the tax free bond facility 
the company also entered into a cap agreement on a notional amount of million within the tax free bond facility 
the year cap agreement has a strike rate of as indexed on the bma municipal swap index 
additionally  the company has one interest rate swap with a notional amount of million which has a variable leg based on three month libor  and a fixed leg with an average rate of which expires in and has to date proven to be a highly effective hedge of the designated borrowings of union planters 
the company has also executed one forward interest rate swap with a notional balance of million which goes into effect in the variable leg of the forward interest rate swap is based on three month libor and the fixed leg has an average rate of 
the swap expires in and is designated as a cash flow hedge on future planned refinancings 
in march  the company had approximating million of debt maturing including the million of bond indebtedness of mid america capital partners  lp  which it funded by debt issued under the fnma facility 
the rate on the maturing debt was and the rate on the replacement debt which was partially pre set through interest rate swaps was 
the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity at december   for the million of debt outstanding were and years compared to and years on million of debt outstanding at december  on july   in an underwritten public offering  the company sold  shares of its series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock series h at per share less an underwriting discount of per share

the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund both its current operations  annual refurbishment of its properties  and incremental investment in new apartment properties 
the company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities  and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of fnma  which provides credit enhancement for nearly million of the company s outstanding debt 
the market for fnma dmbs  which in the company s experience is highly effective with three month libor interest rates  is also an important component of the company s liquidity and swap effectiveness 
in the event that the fnma dmbs market becomes less efficient  or the credit of fnma becomes impaired  the company would seek alternative sources of debt financing 
the company believes that cash provided by operations is adequate and anticipates that it will continue to be adequate in both the short and long term to meet operating requirements including recurring capital expenditures at the communities and payment of distributions by the company in accordance with reit requirements under the internal revenue code 
the company has loan covenants that limit the total amount of distributions  but believes that it is unlikely that these will be a limiting factor on the company s future levels of distributions based on the company s current range of forecast of operating performance 
the company expects to meet its liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  expansions  and non recurring capital expenditures  through collateralized borrowings  potential joint venture transactions and the company s credit facilities 
currently  the company s operating cash flow is insufficient to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate 
while the company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings  any significant deterioration in operations could result in the company s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate  in which event the company would be required to cut the distribution rate 
the following table reflects the company s total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long term debt as of december  dollars in s payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt capital lease operating lease purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
the company s joint venture with blackstone terminated in was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in ffo from the sale 
the company s joint venture with crow holdings was established to acquire approximately million of multifamily properties 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships 
the company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationships with the company or its related parties other than what is disclosed in
