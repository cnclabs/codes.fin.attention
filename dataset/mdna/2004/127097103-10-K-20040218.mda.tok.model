item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
please read forward looking information on page we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development 
overview cabot oil gas is a leading independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil from its properties in north america 
our exploration activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to large  multi well  repeatable drilling programs and our technical skills 
our program is disciplined and balanced with a focus on achieving strong financial returns 
at cabot  there are three types of investment alternatives that constantly compete for available capital 
these include drilling opportunities  acquisition opportunities and financial opportunities such as debt repayment 
depending on circumstances  we allocate capital among the alternatives based on a rate of return approach 
our goal is to invest capital in the highest return opportunities available at any given time 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of natural gas and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms 
price volatility in the natural gas market has remained prevalent in the last few years 
throughout and  the nymex futures market reported unprecedented natural gas contract prices 
our realized natural gas price was per mcf in to lock in these high prices  we entered into a series of crude oil and natural gas price collars and swaps 
these financial instruments are an integral element of our risk management strategy but prevented us from realizing the full impact of the price environment 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future natural gas and crude oil prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
the tables below illustrate how natural gas prices have fluctuated over the course of and index represents the henry hub index price per mmbtu 
the and price is the natural gas price per mcf realized by us and it includes the impact of the natural gas price collar or swap arrangements natural gas prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index natural gas prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index prices for crude oil have followed a similar path as the commodity market continued to rise in and through the tables below contain the nymex average crude oil price index and our realized per bbl crude oil prices by month for and 
table of contents in per bbl crude oil prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index in per bbl crude oil prices by month jan feb mar apr may jun jul aug sep oct nov dec index we reported earnings of per share  or million  for this is up from the per share  or million  reported in the stronger price environment was the driving factor in this improvement 
prices  including the impact of the hedge arrangements  rose for natural gas and for oil 
substantially offsetting this positive price impact was an after tax impairment of million related to our kurten field see limited partnership for discussion of the impairment and a slight decline in natural gas and crude oil production 
we drilled gross wells with a success rate of in compared to gross wells with a success rate in total capital and exploration expenditures increased million to million in compared to million for in previous years  our capital spending  excluding major acquisitions  used substantially all of our operating cash flow 
in  our capital and exploration expenditures were under this level  allowing us to reduce debt by million 
our strategy in is anticipated to remain consistent with we believe our operating cash flow in will be sufficient to fund our capital and exploration budgeted spending of million and again provide excess cash flow 
we remain focused on our strategies to grow through the drill bit  balancing the higher risk higher reward exploration opportunities with an extensive development program  and from synergistic acquisitions 
we plan to remain disciplined in our capital program while providing for growth potential 
we believe these strategies are appropriate in the current industry environment  enabling us to add shareholder value over the long term 
the preceding paragraphs  discussing our strategic pursuits and goals  contain forward looking information 
please read forward looking information on page financial condition capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and asset based borrowings supported by our oil and gas reserves 
the level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the price of crude oil and natural gas and our ability to control and reduce costs 
demand for crude oil and natural gas has historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season 
however  demand and prices moved higher  strengthening from the first half of into the summer and continued to strengthen through prices in were the result of a higher demand associated with colder than normal winter temperatures  combined with higher storage injection demand in the second and third quarters 

table of contents our primary source of cash during was from funds generated from operations and proceeds from the sale of certain non strategic assets 
cash was primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures  reduce debt and pay dividends 
we had a net cash outflow of million during see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 
year ended december  variance cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used by investing activities cash flows used by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flow discussion and analysis cash flows from operating activities increased due to higher commodity prices partially offset by lower natural gas and crude oil production sales volumes 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
cash flows used in investing activities increased due to an increase in capital spending and exploration expense 
cash flows used in financing activities increased due to additional debt repayments 
the available credit line under our revolving credit facility  currently million  is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the bank s petroleum engineer and other assets 
at december   there was no outstanding balance due on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving term of the credit facility ends in october we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through existing available capacity or new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including acquisitions 
in the event that the available credit line is adjusted below the outstanding level of borrowings  we have a period of three months to reduce our outstanding debt to the adjusted credit line with a requirement to provide additional borrowing base assets or pay down one third of the excess during each of the three months 
our interest expense is expected to be approximately million 
from time to time we enter into financial instruments to hedge our natural gas and crude oil production prices 
while the mark to market positions under the hedging agreements will fluctuate with commodity prices  as a producer  our liquidity exposure due to its outstanding derivative instruments tends to increase when commodity prices increase 
consequently  we are most likely to have the largest unfavorable mark to market position in a high commodity price environment 
at december   the aggregate mark to market liability under the aforementioned hedging agreements was million 

table of contents capitalization our capitalization information is as follows december  in millions debt stockholders equity total capitalization debt to capitalization for the year ended december   we paid dividends of million on our common stock 
a regular dividend of per share of common stock has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company 
capital and exploration expenditures on an annual basis  we generally fund most of our capital and exploration activities  excluding major oil and gas property acquisitions  with cash generated from operations 
we budget these capital expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year 
the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures for the three years ended december  in millions capital expenditures drilling and facilities leasehold acquisitions pipeline and gathering other proved property acquisitions exploration expense total the amount includes the million common stock component of the cody acquisition and excludes the million deferred tax gross up 
we plan to drill gross wells in compared with gross wells drilled in this drilling program includes approximately million in total capital and exploration expenditures  up from million in we will continue to assess the natural gas price environment and may increase or decrease the capital and exploration expenditures accordingly 
there are many factors that impact our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
these include reserve additions and revisions  development costs  impairments and changes in anticipated production in a future period 
in management expects an increase in our depreciation  depletion and amortization rate due to production declines and reserve revisions on certain wells in south louisiana 
this change may result in an increase of depreciation  depletion and amortization of to percent greater than levels 
this increase will not have an impact on our cash flows 

table of contents contractual obligations we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and leases 
we have no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations  and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due by year in thousands total to to beyond long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations non gaap financial measures from time to time management discloses discretionary cash flow and net income and earnings per share  excluding selected items 
these non gaap financial measure calculations may be presented in earnings releases of the company  furnished in form k to the securities and exchange commission  along with reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measure for the period 
discretionary cash flow is defined as net income plus non cash charges and exploration expense 
discretionary cash flow is widely accepted as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company s ability to generate cash which is used to internally fund exploration and development activities  pay dividends and service debt 
discretionary cash flow is presented based on management s belief that this non gaap measure is helpful to investors when comparing our cash flow with the cash flow of other companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities or have different financing and capital structures or tax rates 
discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  as defined by gaap  or as a measure of liquidity  or an alternative to net income 
net income excluding selected items and earnings per share excluding selected items are presented based on management s belief that these non gaap measures enable a user of the financial information to understand the impact of these items on reported results 
additionally  this presentation provides a beneficial comparison to similarly adjusted measurements of prior periods 
net income and earnings per share excluding selected items are not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income and earnings per share  as defined by gaap 
potential impact of our critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the three most significant policies are discussed below 
successful efforts method of accounting we use the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
under this method  acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred 
exploration costs  including seismic purchases and processing  exploratory dry hole drilling costs and costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an exploratory dry hole could have a significant effect on the results of operations 
development costs  including the costs to drill and equip development wells  and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 
we are also exposed to potential impairments if the book value of our assets exceeds their future expected cash flows 
this may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level 
table of contents that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
we determine if an impairment has occurred through either adverse changes or as a result of the annual review of all fields 
the impairment of unamortized capital costs is measured at a lease level and is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected future net cash flows is less than the net book value 
revenue recognition the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers 
natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties 
production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this document is based on estimates we prepared 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than our estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices on the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimates of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
carrying value of long lived assets we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon our estimates of proved crude oil  ngls and natural gas reserves  future crude oil  ngls and natural gas prices and costs to extract these reserves 
downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates or depressed crude oil  ngls and natural gas prices could cause us to reduce the carrying amounts of its properties 
costs attributable to our unproved properties are not subject to the impairment analysis described above  however  a portion of the costs associated with such properties is subject to amortization on a composite basis based on past experience and average property lives 
as these properties are developed and reserves are proven  the remaining 
table of contents capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful  the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made 
the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of the company s future exploration program 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
we follow the accounting prescribed in sfas under sfas  the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at the end of each period  these instruments are marked to market 
the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as other comprehensive income  a component of equity  to the extent that the derivative instrument is an effective hedge 
under sfas  effectiveness is a measurement of how closely correlated the hedge instrument is with the underlying physical sale 
for example  a natural gas price swap that converts henry hub index to a fixed price would be perfectly correlated  and effective  if the underlying gas were sold at the henry hub index 
any portion of the gains or losses that are considered ineffective under the sfas test are recorded immediately as a component of operating revenue on the statement of operations 
long term employee benefit costs our costs of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
our assumed discount rate is based on average rates published for high quality fixed income securities 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation in accordance with current accounting standards there are two alternative methods that can be used to account for stock based compensation 
the first method is the intrinsic value method and recognizes compensation cost as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the second method is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of an award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
currently  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the intrinsic value method 

table of contents other issues and contingencies corporate income tax 
we generated tax credits for the production of certain qualified fuels  including natural gas produced from tight sands formations and devonian shale 
the credit for natural gas from a tight sand formation tight gas sands amounted to per mmbtu for natural gas sold prior to from qualified wells drilled in and a number of wells drilled in the eastern region and rocky mountains during and qualified for the tight gas sands tax credit 
the credit for natural gas produced from devonian shale was per mmbtu in in and  we completed three transactions to monetize the value of these tax credits  resulting in revenues of million in the tax credit wells were repurchased in december and therefore  no monetization revenue was realized in see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have benefited in the past and may benefit in the future from the alternative minimum tax amt relief granted under the comprehensive national energy policy act of the act 
the act repealed provisions of the amt requiring a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income to be increased on account of certain intangible drilling costs idc and percentage depletion deductions 
the repeal of these provisions generally applies to taxable years beginning after the repeal of the excess idc preference can not reduce a taxpayer s alternative minimum taxable income by more than of the amount of such income determined without regard to the repeal of such preference 
regulations 
our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
see regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation and environmental regulations in the other business matters section of item business for a discussion of these regulations 
restrictive covenants 
our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in the company s various debt instruments 
among other requirements  our revolving credit agreement and the notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of to at december   we are in compliance with all restrictive covenants on both the revolving credit agreement and the notes 
in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants  the company may apply for a temporary waiver with the bank  which  if granted  would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation 
see further discussion in capital resources and liquidity 
limited partnership 
as part of the cody acquisition  we acquired an interest in certain oil and gas properties in the kurten field  as general partner of a partnership and as an operator 
prior to the liquidation of the partnership and the divestiture of our interest in the field  we had an interest of approximately  including a one percent interest in the partnership 
the liquidation and divestiture was effective july and november  respectively  of under the partnership agreement  we had the right to a reversionary working interest that would have brought our ultimate interest to upon the limited partner reaching payout 
under the partnership agreement  the limited partner had the option to trigger a liquidation of the partnership 
effective february   the kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner s election 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
based on the receipt of the appraisal in february  we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field  the limited partner s decision and our decision to proceed with the liquidation  we performed an impairment review which resulted in an after tax charge of approximately million 
this impairment charge is reflected in the statement of operations as an operating expense but did not impact our cash flows 

table of contents operating risks and insurance coverage 
our business involves a variety of operating risks  including blowouts  cratering and explosions  mechanical problems  uncontrolled flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution and other environmental risks  and natural disasters 
the operation of our natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks  including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase these risks 
any of these events could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we choose to operate 
during the past few years  we have drilled a higher percentage of our wells in the gulf coast  where insurance rates are significantly higher than in other regions such as the east 
commodity pricing and risk management activities 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of our annual impairment test under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
because our reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on our financial results 
the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
however  management may mitigate this price risk with the use of financial instruments 
most recently  we have used financial instruments such as price collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue 
under both arrangements  there is also risk that the movement of the index prices will result in the company not being able to realize the full benefit of a market improvement 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb approved for issuance statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas establishes accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the timing of the liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the adoption of sfas resulted in an increase of total liabilities  because more retirement obligations are required to be recognized  an increase in the recognized cost of assets  because the retirement costs are added to the carrying amount of the long lived assets  and an increase in operating expense  because of the accretion of the retirement obligation and additional depreciation and depletion 
the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the 
table of contents plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells 
the company adopted the statement on january  the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas has been reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in january in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin or interpretation 
fin is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as vies 
the interpretation requires an enterprise to consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
an enterprise shall consider the rights and obligations conveyed by its variable interests in making this determination 
at december  we did not have any entities that would qualify for consolidation in accordance with the provisions of fin therefore  the adoption of fin did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and hedging activities under sfas the amendments set forth in sfas require that contracts with comparable characteristics be accounted for similarly 
sfas is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  with a few exceptions and for hedging relationships designated after june  the guidance is to be applied prospectively only 
the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement was developed in response to concerns expressed by preparers  auditors  regulators  investors  and other users of financial statements about issuers classification in the statement of financial position of certain financial instruments that have characteristics of both liabilities and equity but that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the statement of financial position 
this statement also addresses questions about the classification of certain financial instruments that embody obligations to issue equity shares 
in accordance with sfas  companies with consolidated entities that will terminate by a specified date  such as limited life partnerships  will have to measure the liabilities for the other owners interests in those limited life entities based on the fair values of the limited life entities assets 
period to period changes in the liabilities are to be reported in the consolidated income statement as interest costs 
as a result of sfas  liability amounts and related interest costs may be significantly greater than the minority interests previously recognized 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we have been made aware of an issue regarding the application of provisions of sfas  business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas requires registrants to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights  
table of contents including both proved and unproved leasehold acquisition costs  as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs 
historically  cabot and other oil and gas companies have included the cost of these oil and gas leasehold interests as part of oil and gas properties and provided the disclosures required by sfas no 
 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities sfas 
also under consideration is whether sfas requires registrants to provide the additional disclosures prescribed by sfas for intangible assets for costs associated with mineral rights 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas requires us to reclassify costs associated with mineral rights from property and equipment to intangible assets  management currently believes that its results of operations and financial condition would not be affected  since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with existing successful efforts accounting rules and impairment standards 
in addition  costs associated with mineral rights would continue to be characterized as oil and gas property costs in our required disclosures under sfas at december   we had net undeveloped leaseholds of approximately million that would be classified on our balance sheet as intangible undeveloped leaseholds and developed leaseholds of approximately million net of accumulated depletion that would be classified as intangible developed leaseholds if we applied the interpretation currently being discussed 
on december   the fasb issued sfas  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of sfas   and  and a revision of sfas this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by sfas  employers accounting for pensions  sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the new rules require additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
the new disclosures are effective for calendar year financial statements 
forward looking information the statements regarding future financial and operating performance and results  market prices  future hedging activities  and other statements that are not historical facts contained in this report are forward looking statements 
the words expect  project  estimate  believe  anticipate  intend  budget  plan  forecast  predict  may  should  could  will and similar expressions are also intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  market factors  market prices including regional basis differentials of natural gas and oil  results for future drilling and marketing activity  future production and costs and other factors detailed herein and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual outcomes may vary materially from those indicated 

table of contents results of operations and compared net income and operating revenue we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
during the corresponding period of  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income increased by million compared to the comparable period of the prior year 
the increase in net income and operating income was substantially due to an increase in our realized natural gas and crude oil prices 
natural gas production revenues the average total company realized natural gas production sales price  including the realized impact of derivative instruments  was per mcf 
due to derivative instruments this price was reduced by per mcf

this increase is substantially related to a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million related to the loss of a reversionary interest in the kurten field 
effective february   the kurten partnership commenced liquidation at the limited partner s election 
in connection with the liquidation  an appraisal was obtained to allocate the interest in the partnership assets 
based on the receipt of the appraisal in february  we would not receive the reversionary interest as part of the liquidation 
due to the impact of the loss of the reversionary interest on future estimated net cash flows of the kurten field we performed an impairment review which resulted in an million charge 
taxes other than income increased million as a result of higher commodity prices realized in the year ended as compared to the same period of the prior year 
interest expense interest expense decreased million 
this variance is due to the combination of a lower average level of outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility as well as a decline in interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense increased million due to a comparable increase in our pre tax net income 
and compared net income and operating revenue during  we reported net income of million  or per share 
operating income decreased million and operating revenues decreased million in the decrease in operating revenues was mainly a result of the million decline in natural gas sales due to the decrease in natural gas prices and the million decrease in brokered natural gas sales revenue  which was also a result of lower prices 
natural gas revenue and our realized price were reduced by million due to hedges in place during see further discussion in item a 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in crude oil revenue of million due to a increase in the volume of crude oil produced 
operating income was similarly impacted by these revenue changes

table of contents operating expenses total costs and expenses from operations decreased million  or  from due primarily to the following brokered natural gas cost decreased million primarily due to the million impact of decreased natural gas costs per mcf 
volumes of brokered gas purchases decreased slightly contributing further to a reduction in the amount of million 
production and pipeline expense increased million  or  primarily as a result of a full year of costs associated with operating the cody company properties acquired in august additionally  increased insurance costs and increased drilling activity in the gulf coast and rockies contributed to the rise in expense 
on a units of production basis  our company wide production and pipeline expense was per mcfe in versus per mcfe in exploration expense decreased million primarily as a result of the following an million decrease in geological and geophysical expenses over last year due to the unusually high acquisition of seismic data for future evaluation 
a million decrease in dry hole costs 
in  we drilled nine exploratory wells compared to in our success rate on these wells improved from in to in the million in dry hole cost recognized in includes expenditures related to three wells from the drilling program determined to be dry in  in the amount of million  as well as costs of abandoning certain sections of exploration well bores that were not economical  in the amount of million 
a million increase for salaries  wages and related benefits largely attributable to increased staffing in the gulf coast region during to support that year s expanded drilling program and assimilating cody 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of unproved properties expense increased million  or  over natural gas equivalent production increased  increasing dd a expense by million 
the increase in the per unit expense from per mcfe to per mcfe was a result of increased production in the higher cost gulf coast region including a full year impact of the newly acquired cody properties and resulted in an million increase to dd a expense for impairment of long lived assets decreased by million this year 
this year we recorded impairments on four small fields  three of which were in the gulf coast and one in the rocky mountains 
for each of these fields  the capitalized cost exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
a pipeline in the eastern region was written down to fair market value 
last year  two fields in the gulf coast region were impaired since the cost capitalized exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows 
also in  one natural gas processing plant in the rocky mountains area was written down to fair market value 
in the fourth quarter of  the starpath prospect in the gulf coast region was impaired 
general and administrative expenses increased million due to the costs associated with the retirement of the chief executive officer in may taxes other than income decreased million as a result of lower natural gas and oil revenues 
interest expense interest expense increased million due to the full year impact of the incremental debt used to partially fund the cody acquisition in august interest expense on the credit facility was down slightly due both to lower levels of borrowings and lower interest rates 
income tax expense income tax expense was down million due to the comparable decrease in earnings before income tax 
our effective tax rate decreased slightly in reflecting a shift of activity between states 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and gas prices fluctuate widely  and low prices for an extended period of time are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and natural gas prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas 
the level of consumer product demand 
weather conditions 
political conditions in oil producing regions  including the middle east 
the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls 
the price of foreign imports 
actions of governmental authorities 
domestic and foreign governmental regulations 
the price  availability and acceptance of alternative fuels 
overall economic conditions 
these factors make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil and gas 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity 
our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection 
these hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of increases in prices 
please read the discussion below related to commodity price swaps for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements 
derivative instruments and hedging activity periodically we enter into derivative commodity instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production 
at december   we had cash flow hedges open natural gas price collar arrangements and natural gas price swap arrangements 
additionally  we had four crude oil financial instruments and one natural gas financial instrument open at december   that did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas at december   a million million net of tax unrealized loss was recorded to other comprehensive income  along with a million derivative liability and a million derivative receivable 
the change in derivative fair value for the current and prior periods have been included as a component of natural gas production and crude oil and condensate revenue  as appropriate 

table of contents the following table summarizes the realized and unrealized impact of derivative activity reflected in the respective line item in operating revenues 
year ended december  realized unrealized realized unrealized realized unrealized operating revenues increase decrease to revenue natural gas production crude oil assuming no change in commodity prices  after december  we would reclassify to earnings  over the next months  million in after tax expenditures associated with commodity derivatives 
this reclassification represents the net liability associated with open positions at december  related to anticipated production 
hedges on production swaps from time to time  we enter into natural gas and crude oil swap agreements with counterparties to hedge price risk associated with a portion of our production 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
under these price swaps  we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas and crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a market based index  such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures 
under our revolving credit agreement  the aggregate level of commodity hedging must not exceed of the anticipated future equivalent production during the period covered by the hedges 
during  natural gas price swaps covered  mmcf  or of our gas production  fixing the sales price of this gas at an average of per mcf 
at december   we had open natural gas price swap contracts covering our and production as follows natural gas price swaps contract period volume in mmcf weighted average contract price unrealized loss in thousands as of december  natural gas price swaps on production in first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year from time to time we enter into natural gas and crude oil derivative arrangements that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas these financial instruments are recorded at fair value at the balance sheet date 
at december   we had four open crude oil swap arrangements and one natural gas swap arrangement with an unrealized net loss of million and million  respectively  recognized in operating revenues 

table of contents hedges on production options throughout and  we believed that the pricing environment provided a strategic opportunity to significantly reduce the price risk on a portion of our production through the use of natural gas and crude oil collars 
under the collar arrangements  if the index price rises above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
if the index falls below the floor price  the counterparty pays us 
during  natural gas price collars covered  mmcf  or of our gas production  with a weighted average floor of per mcf and a weighted average ceiling of per mcf 
additionally  during  we had crude oil price collars which covered mbbls  or of our production  with a weighted average floor of per bbl and a weighted average ceiling of per bbl 
these crude oil contracts expired in june at december   we had open natural gas price collar contracts covering our and production as follows natural gas price collars contract period volume in mmcf weighted average ceiling floor unrealized loss in thousands as of december  natural gas price collars on production in first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year at december   we have no open crude oil price collar arrangements to cover future production 
we are exposed to market risk on these open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and oil 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
the preceding paragraphs contain forward looking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses  which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future market prices of energy commodities
