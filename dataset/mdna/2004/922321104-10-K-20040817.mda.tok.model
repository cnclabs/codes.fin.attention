the following discussion should be read in conjunction with financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview vasomedical  inc incorporated in delaware in july is primarily engaged in designing  manufacturing  marketing and supporting eecp external counterpulsation systems based on our proprietary technology 
eecp therapy is a non invasive  outpatient therapy for the treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system 
the therapy serves to increase circulation in areas of the heart with less than adequate blood supply and may restore systemic vascular function 
we provide hospitals and physician private practices with eecp equipment  treatment guidance  and a staff training and maintenance program designed to provide optimal patient outcomes 
eecp is a registered trademark for vasomedical s enhanced external counterpulsation systems 
we have food and drug administration fda approval to market the eecp therapy for use in the treatment of angina pectoris ie  chest pain  cardiogenic shock  acute myocardial infarction ie  heart attack  mi and congestive heart failure chf  however our current marketing efforts are limited to the treatment of refractory angina  where reimbursement for the eecp treatment is available 
medicare and numerous other commercial third party payers currently provide reimbursement for the treatment of refractory angina using the eecp therapy 
we are also actively engaged in research to establish the potential benefits of eecp therapy in the management of chf and are sponsoring a pivotal study to demonstrate the efficacy of eecp therapy in most types of heart failure patients 
this study  known as peech prospective evaluation of eecp in congestive heart failure  is intended to provide additional clinical data in order to support a medicare national coverage policy for the use of the eecp therapy in the treatment of chf 
we expect to be able to release the results of the peech trial by early results of operations fiscal years ended may  and summary we generated revenues from the sale  lease and service of our eecp systems of  and  for the years ended may  and  respectively  reflecting a decrease of  or 
our loss before income taxes was  and  for the years ended may  and  respectively 
we reported a net loss of  and  for the years ended may  and  respectively 
revenues the decline in revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due primarily to lower revenue from the sale of eecp systems in the domestic market 
domestic equipment revenue for fiscal declined approximately compared to prior year due to a reduction in the average sales price for eecp systems of approximately  a higher proportion of used equipment compared to new equipment sold during fiscal year compared to  plus adoption of the provisions of eitf average domestic selling prices have been declining for several years reflecting the impact in the market of lower priced competitive products 
we believe that the eecp systems currently sell at a significant price premium to competitive products reflecting the clinical efficacy and superior quality of the eecp system plus the many value added services offered by us  however we anticipate that this current trend of declining prices will continue in the immediate future as our competition attempts to capture greater market share through pricing discounts 
revenue in fiscal year reflects a increase in the sale of used equipment to the domestic market 
this increase in used equipment sales reflects primarily an increase in used equipment available for sale following the completion of the peech trial and the repossession of eecp systems from previous sales type lease customers 
we sell used equipment as available to help lessen the impact of price sensitive situations 
in september  we adopted revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf 
during the nine months following adoption of the provisions of eitf  as a result of the adoption of the new policy  we deferred  of revenue related to the fair value of installation and in service training and  of revenue related to the warranty service for eecp system sales  which would have previously been recognized as revenue during the period 
international shipments of eecp systems declined approximately to  due to a higher sales rate in the previous year following receipt of the ce mark 
this was partially offset by a increase in revenue from equipment rental and services reflecting an increase of approximately in service related revenue 
the higher service revenue reflects an increase in service  spare parts and consumables as a result of the continued growth of the installed base of eecp systems and greater marketing focus on the sale of extended service contracts 
rental revenue declined approximately during the period reflecting fewer outstanding rental agreements and lower average rental prices 
reimbursement continues to play a critical role in the adoption of the eecp therapy 
medicare dropped the payment rates from per hour to per hour for physicians at the beginning of calendar year the current reimbursement rate is now set at the rates near when the product first received medicare coverage in  which makes it more difficult for a private physician practice to financially justify an investment to provide the eecp therapy 
it is difficult for us to determine the exact impact this decline has had on the market for the eecp therapy 
additionally  the impact from the drop in reimbursement has been partially offset by the decline in average selling prices and we believe that the eecp therapy continues to offer an attractive addition to the physician private practice  plus the company has continued to support its customers in gaining positive reimbursement coverage from other third party payers during the past year 
eecp therapy is now covered by the majority of private insurers for treating angina patients  including many of the leading blue cross blue shield plans  who typically are the most difficult payers to adopt coverage for new technologies 
gross profit gross profit was  or of revenues for the year ended may   compared to  or of revenues for the year ended may  gross profit margin as a percentage of revenue for the twelve month period ended may   improved compared to the same year of the prior fiscal year despite the lower revenue and the impact from the reduction in average selling prices 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales reflects the decline in expenditures for service related parts  travel and personnel for the year ended may   when compared to same period of the prior year 
in addition  the gross profit margin benefited from the sale of an unusually high percentage of used equipment when compared to the prior year 
these systems carried lower book values since they were partially amortized and as a result generated above average margins 
we have limited quantities of the lower cost systems and do not anticipate a significant volume of used equipment will be sold in the future 
the decline in gross profit when compared to the prior year in absolute dollars is a direct result of the lower sales volume 
gross profits are dependent on a number of factors  particularly the mix of eecp models sold and their respective average selling prices  the mix of eecp units sold  rented or placed during the period  the ongoing costs of servicing such units  and certain fixed period costs  including facilities  payroll and insurance 
gross profit margins are generally less on non domestic business due to the use of distributors resulting in lower selling prices 
consequently  the gross profit realized during the current period may not be indicative of future margins 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the year ended may  and were  or of revenues as compared to  or of revenues  respectively 
the decrease of sg a resulted primarily from a one time  charge arising from the settlement of litigation in the prior year plus a severance charge for approximately  in the prior year  as well as lower marketing expenditures  primarily for outside services and promotional spending for print and electronic media during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year the above decreases were partially offset by higher administrative and selling expenses  which reflected increased insurance costs and continued investment in our direct sales force  consisting of additional personnel and higher incentive and travel costs 
research and development research and development r d expenses of  or of revenues for fiscal year  decreased by  or  from fiscal year expenses of  or of revenues 
the decrease is due primarily to reduced clinical study expenditures related to the completion of several smaller clinical studies and  at several sites  the patient treatment phase of the peech study 
this decrease was partially offset by increased product development costs related to new eecp system models and improvements 
we expect to continue our investments in product development and clinical trials in fiscal and beyond to further validate and expand the clinical applications of the eecp therapy 
provision for doubtful accounts during the year ended may   we charged  to our provision for doubtful accounts as compared to  during the year ended may  in fiscal  these charges reflect management decision in the second quarter of fiscal to record a  provision to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents all funds due from a sales type lease customer 
we sold our eecp systems to a major customer engaged in establishing independent networks of eecp treatment centers under a sales type lease aggregating revenues of  no additional equipment was sold to this customer during fiscal or this customer became delinquent in its scheduled monthly payments during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the first and second quarters of fiscal the customer attempted to remedy the situation and made payments to us totaling  in december  the customer ceased operations 
additional provisions for all other accounts totals approximately  in fiscal  these charges primarily resulted from approximately a million write off of receivables with respect to another major customer  comprised of million for the capital lease and  in notes receivable  as well as specific reserves against certain international accounts for which extended credit terms were offered 
we no longer offer sales type leases 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and financing costs decreased to  in the year ended may   from  for the same period in the prior year due to repayment of our revolving secured credit facility in may  which resulted in lower average outstanding borrowings during the fiscal year 
interest and other income  net interest income and other income for the years ended may   and may  was  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income from the prior year is the direct result of the absence of interest income related to certain equipment sold under sales type leases incurred in fiscal  as well as declining interest rates this year over last year earned on the average cash balances 
higher average cash balances invested during the year ended may   compared to the prior period partially offset the above 
income tax expense benefit  net during the fiscal year ended may   we recorded a provision for state income taxes of  this is in contrast to an income tax benefit of  reported during the fiscal year ended may  as of may   we had recorded deferred tax assets of  net of a  valuation allowance related to the anticipated recovery of tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the tax loss carryforwards 
we believe that the company is positioned for long term growth despite the financial results achieved during fiscal years and  and that based upon the weight of available evidence  that it is more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the more likely than not standard is subjective  and is based upon management s estimate of a greater than probability that its long range business plan can be realized 
ultimate realization of any or all of the deferred tax assets is not assured  due to significant uncertainties associated with estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period 
our estimates are largely dependent upon achieving considerable growth resulting from the successful commercialization of the eecp therapy into the congestive heart failure indication 
such future estimates of future taxable income are based on our beliefs  as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us 
certain critical assumptions associated with our estimates include that the results from the peech clinical trial will be sufficiently positive to enable the eecp therapy to obtain approval for a national medicare reimbursement coverage policy plus other third party payer reimbursement policies specific to the congestive heart failure indication  that the reimbursement coverage will be both broad enough in terms of coverage language and at an amount adequate to enable successful commercialization of the eecp therapy into the congestive heart failure indication 
additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the effect of the dramatic changes taking place in the healthcare environment  the impact of competitive procedures and products and their pricing  other medical insurance reimbursement policies  unexpected manufacturing problems  unforeseen difficulties and delays in the conduct of clinical trials and other product development programs  the actions of regulatory authorities and third party payers in the united states and overseas  uncertainties about the acceptance of a novel therapeutic modality by the medical community  and the risk factors reported from time to time in our sec reports 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or if the accounting standards are changed to reflect a more stringent standard for evaluation of deferred tax assets 
the recorded deferred tax asset and increase to the valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended may  was  fiscal years ended may  and summary we generated revenues from the sale  lease and service of eecp systems of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  representing a decrease 
we generated earnings loss before income taxes of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we reported net earnings loss of  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  after recognition of an income tax provision benefit of  and  respectively 
revenue the decrease in revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal is a result of the following revenues in fiscal were favorably impacted by  resulting from the shipment of eecp systems under sales type leases and there was no equipment sold under sales type leases in fiscal revenues in fiscal were affected by several factors including  an increase in the duration of the selling cycle of our eecp systems and reduced average unit selling prices 
factors that have caused a longer selling cycle for eecp systems include  among other things  a a change in the mix of prospective customers toward larger medical practices and hospitals which have longer decision making processes  b inconsistent or inadequate reimbursement coverage policies among certain third party insurers  and c general economic conditions 
factors that have contributed to reduced average selling prices include increased competition and general economic conditions 
fiscal revenues from equipment sales were adversely impacted by reductions in average selling prices aggregating approximately revenues from non domestic business were  accounting for nearly of total revenues compared to  or  in fiscal our revenue growth over the previous fiscal year periods through resulted primarily from the increase in cardiology practices and hospitals who became providers of eecp therapy following the announcement by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms in february of its decision to extend medicare coverage nationally to the company s noninvasive  outpatient treatment for coronary artery disease 
cms is the federal agency that administers the medicare program for approximately million beneficiaries 
in addition  the results of our multicenter  prospective  randomized  blinded  controlled clinical study of eecp must eecp were published in the june issue of the journal of the american college of cardiology 
interest in eecp therapy was also spurred by the announcement of the results of six month  twelve month and twenty four month post treatment outcomes reported by the international eecp patient registry  as well as numerous other studies reported and presented at major scientific meetings  including the american heart association aha and the american college of cardiology acc annual meetings 
gross profit gross profit margins for fiscal and fiscal and were and  respectively 
the decrease in overall gross profit for fiscal compared to primarily resulted from increases in unit costs  due to lower production levels  as well as overall reductions in the average selling price of eecp systems 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal and fiscal were  of revenues and  of revenues  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the significant decrease in revenues from the prior comparable periods  as discussed above 
the increase in sg a expenses  on an absolute basis  from the comparable prior fiscal periods resulted primarily from a  accrual arising from the settlement of litigation in the first quarter  non recurring charges of  for employee severance arrangements and executive recruiting fees in the second quarter  partially offset by overall decreases in sales related expenses due to decreased revenues 
research and development research and development r d expenses of  of revenues for fiscal decreased by  or  from fiscal r d expenses of  of revenues 
r d expenses are primarily impacted by the peech clinical trial in heart failure and other clinical initiatives including the international eecp patient registry  as well as continued product design and development costs 
provision for doubtful accounts during fiscal  we charged  net of bad debt recoveries of  to our provision for doubtful accounts as compared to  in fiscal these charges primarily resulted from the write off of receivables from a major customer during the first quarter of fiscal of approximately  due to significant uncertainties related to this customer s ability to satisfy its financial obligations to the company see note e of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as specific reserves against certain domestic and international accounts that defaulted on their payment obligations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we were able to successfully recover all of the units that we had sold under sales type leases to the aforementioned major customer back into our finished goods inventory and recorded a bad debt recovery of  which represented the carrying amount of the equipment at that time 
interest expense and financing costs the increase in interest expense over the prior periods is primarily due to interest on working capital borrowings and related charges under our revolving secured credit facility  as well as loans secured to refinance the november purchase of our headquarters and warehouse facility 
interest and other income  net the decrease in interest income from the prior fiscal period is the direct result of a decrease in interest income related to certain equipment sold under sales type leases to a major customer reported in fiscal and during the first quarter of fiscal  as well as declining interest rates this year over last year  offset by the increase in the average cash balances invested during the current year 
income tax expense benefit  net in fiscal  we recorded a net benefit for income taxes of  inclusive of a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow we have financed our operations in fiscal and primarily from operations and working capital 
at may   we had a cash  cash equivalents  and certificates of deposit balance of  and working capital of  as compared to a cash balance of  and working capital of  at may  our cash  cash equivalents  and certificates of deposit balances increased  in fiscal year primarily due to  in cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in cash provided by our operating activities resulted primarily from lower accounts receivable  which provided cash of  for the fiscal year ended may  net accounts receivable were of quarterly revenues for the three month period ended may   compared to at the end of the three month period ended may   and net accounts receivable turnover improved to times as of may   as compared to times as of may  we have tightened our sales credit policy  reduced extended payment terms and provide routine oversight with respect to our accounts receivable credit and collection efforts 
standard payment terms on our domestic equipment sales are generally net to days from shipment and do not contain right of return provisions 
we have historically offered a variety of extended payment terms  including sales type leases  in certain situations and to certain customers in order to expand the market for our eecp products in the us and internationally 
such extended payment terms were offered in lieu of price concessions  in competitive situations  when opening new markets or geographies and for repeat customers 
extended payment terms cover a variety of negotiated terms  including payment in full net  net days or some fixed or variable monthly payment amount for a six to twelve month period followed by a balloon payment  if applicable 
during the fiscal years ended may  and  approximately and of revenues  respectively  were generated from sales in which payment terms were greater than days and we offered no sales type leases during either period 
in general  reserves are calculated on a formula basis considering factors such as the aging of the receivables  time past due  and the customer s credit history and their current financial status 
in most instances where reserves are required  or accounts are ultimately written off  customers have been unable to successfully implement their eecp program 
as we are creating a new market for the eecp therapy and recognizing the challenges that some customers may encounter  we have opted  at times  on a customer by customer basis  to recover our equipment instead of pursuing other legal remedies  which has resulted in our recording of a reserve or a write off 
other key factors causing the increase in cash from the prior year provided by our operating activities included the reduction in inventories  which decreased by  for the fiscal year ended may   reflecting efforts to improve our procurement of raw materials and management of finished goods inventory levels and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of  additionally  non cash adjustments for depreciation  amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for inventory write offs to reconcile the net loss of  to net cash provided by operating activities total  investing activities used net cash of  during the fiscal year ended may   reflecting investment associated with the purchase of short term certificates of deposit of  and the purchase of property and equipment  primarily the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning software erp  of  financing activities provided net cash of  during the fiscal year ended may   reflecting  received form the exercise of stock options plus new borrowings of  related to our new erp system 
payments of principal on notes and loans were  partially offsetting the above 
we cancelled our line of credit in august and do not currently have an available line of credit 
we believe that our cash flow from operations together with our current cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our business plan and projected capital requirements through at least may   however  despite our improved cash balances  we have incurred significant losses during the last two fiscal years and our long term ability to maintain current operations is dependent upon achieving profitable operations or through additional debt or equity financing 
in the event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financings 
future capital funding  if available  may result in dilution to current shareholders 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of may   we are not involved in any unconsolidated spe 
contractual obligations the following table presents our expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of may  due as of due as of due as of and and due total thereafter long term debt      operating leases    litigation settlement    severance obligations   employment agreements    total contractual cash      obligations effects of inflation we believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  in december  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended may  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the united states  we recognize revenue from the sale of our eecp systems in the period in which we deliver the system to the customer 
revenue from the sale of our eecp systems to international markets is recognized upon shipment  during the period in which we deliver the product to a common carrier  as are supplies  accessories and spare parts delivered to both domestic and international customers 
returns are accepted prior to the installation and in service training subject to a restocking charge or for normal warranty matters  and we are not obligated for post sale upgrades to these systems 
in most cases  revenue from direct eecp system sales is generated from multiple element arrangements that require judgment in the areas of customer acceptance  collectibility  the separability of units of accounting  and the fair value of individual elements 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  on a prospective basis 
the principles and guidance outlined in eitf provide a framework to determine a how the arrangement consideration should be measured b whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting  and c how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
we determined that our multiple element arrangements are generally comprised of the following elements that would qualify as separate units of accounting system sales  in service support consisting of equipment set up and training provided at the customers facilities and warranty service for system sales generally covered by a warranty period of one year 
each of these elements represent individual units of accounting as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items  and arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
we determine fair value based on the price of the deliverable when it is sold separately or based on third party evidence 
in accordance with the guidance in eitf  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when it does not have fair value of the eecp system sale 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for eecp system sales when delivery and acceptance occurs  for installation and in service training when the services are rendered  and for warranty service ratably over the service period  which is generally one year 
upon adoption of the provisions of eitf beginning september   we deferred  of revenue  net of amortization during the period  related to the fair value of installation and in service training plus  of revenue  net of amortization during the period  related to the warranty service for eecp system sales delivered during the nine month period ended may  the amount related to warranty service will be recognized as service revenue ratably over the related service period  which is generally one year 
previously  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we accrued costs associated with these arrangements as warranty expense in the period the system was delivered and accepted 
we also recognize revenue generated from servicing eecp systems that are no longer covered by a warranty agreement  or by providing sites with additional training  in the period that these services are provided 
revenue related to future commitments under separately priced extended warranty agreements on the eecp system are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one year to four years 
deferred revenues related to extended warranty agreements that have been invoiced to customers prior to the performance of these services were  and  as of may  and  respectively 
costs associated with the provision of service and maintenance  including salaries  benefits  travel  spare parts and equipment  are recognized in cost of sales as incurred 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have also entered into lease agreements for our eecp systems  generally for terms of one year or less  that are classified as operating leases 
revenues from operating leases are generally recognized  in accordance with the terms of the lease agreements  on a straight line basis over the life of the respective leases 
for certain operating leases in which payment terms are determined on a fee per use basis  revenues are recognized as incurred ie  as actual usage occurs 
the cost of the eecp system utilized under operating leases is recorded as a component of property and equipment and is amortized to cost of sales over the estimated useful life of the equipment  not to exceed five years 
there were no significant minimum rental commitments on these operating leases at may  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for leases  for sales of eecp systems under sales type leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record the sale and financing receivable at the amount of the minimum lease payment  less unearned interest income  which is computed at the interest rate implicit in the lease  an allowance for bad debt and executory costs  which are primarily related to product warranties on each unit sold 
unearned interest income is amortized to income in a manner that produces a constant rate of return on the investment in the sales type lease 
the cost of the eecp system acquired by the customer is recorded as cost of sales in the same period that the sale is recorded 
at the present time  the company is no longer offering sales type leases 
accounts receivable financing receivables our accounts receivable trade are due from customers engaged in the provision of medical services 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due to days from shipment and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts  returns  term discounts and other allowances 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collections experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  we look at historical write offs of our receivables 
we also look at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from its customers 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
in addition  we periodically review and assess the net realizability of our receivables arising from sales type leases 
if this review results in a lower estimate of the net realizable value of the receivable  an allowance for the unrealized amount is established in the period in which the estimate is changed 
in the first quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to write off financing receivables under sales type leases of approximately  and  respectively  as a result of significant uncertainties with respect to these customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
inventories  net we value inventory at the lower of cost or estimated market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we often place eecp systems at various field locations for demonstration  training  evaluation  and other similar purposes at no charge 
the cost of these eecp systems is transferred to property and equipment and is amortized over the next two to five years 
we record the cost of refurbished components of eecp systems and critical components at cost plus the cost of refurbishment 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand  particularly raw materials and components  and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on existing and anticipated design and engineering changes to our products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
deferred revenues we record revenue on extended service contracts ratably over the term of the related warranty contracts 
effective september   we prospectively adopted the provisions of eitf upon adoption of the provisions of eitf we began to defer revenue related to eecp system sales for the fair value of installation and in service training to the period when the services are rendered and for warranty obligations ratably over the service period  which is generally one year 
warranty costs equipment sold is generally covered by a warranty period of one year 
effective september   we adopted the provisions of eitf on a prospective basis 
under eitf  for certain arrangements  a portion of the overall system price attributable to the first year warranty service is deferred and recognized as revenue over the service period 
as such  we no longer accrue warranty costs upon delivery but rather recognize warranty and related service costs as incurred 
prior to september   we accrued a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services when the equipment sale was recognized 
the factors affecting our warranty liability included the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
the warranty provision resulting from transactions prior to september  will be reduced in future periods for material and labor costs incurred as related product is returned during the warranty period or when the warranty period elapses 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards for which income tax benefits are expected to be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally consider all expected future events other than an enactment of changes in the tax laws or rates 
the deferred tax asset is continually evaluated for realizability 
to the extent our judgment regarding the realization of the deferred tax assets change  an adjustment to the allowance is recorded  with an offsetting increase or decrease  as appropriate  in income tax expense 
such adjustments are recorded in the period in which our estimate as to the realizability of the asset changed that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the more likely than not standard is subjective  and is based upon our estimate of a greater than probability that our long range business plan can be realized 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are classified as current or non current based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting 
a deferred tax liability or asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards  are classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
the deferred tax asset we recorded relates primarily to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards  of which the allocation of the current portion  if any  reflects the expected utilization of such net operating losses in next twelve months 
such allocation is based our internal financial forecast and may be subject to revision based upon actual results 
stock compensation we have four stock based employee compensation plans 
we account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb no 
and have adopted the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
under apb no 
 when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in connection with employee stock option grants 
pro forma compensation expense may not be indicative of future disclosures because it does not take into effect pro forma compensation expense related to grants before for purposes of estimating the fair value of each option on the date of grant  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options 
equity instruments issued to non employees in exchange for goods  fees and services are accounted for under the fair value based method of sfas no 
recently issued accounting standards in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for the provisions that were cleared by the fasb in prior pronouncements
