table of contents overview micro linear develops integrated circuits and modules that enable cost effective  high performance digital wireless communications and connectivity for a broad range of voice and data applications 
we were founded in  and until we were a supplier of advanced analog and mixed signal integrated circuits to the computer  communications  telecommunications  consumer and industrial markets 
during  we divested our manufacturing test operation and our non communication product lines and focused our marketing  engineering and product development on new communications products  including some wired networking products  but most notably wireless integrated circuits 
during  we established ourselves as a volume supplier of rf transceivers to the digital cordless telephone segment of the communications market 
wireless product revenues represented of net revenues for compared to of net revenues for we expect the revenue contribution from wireless products to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
on october  we announced that in order to better align our product development activities with our revenue producing markets  we would stop development of a broadband wireless products 
the realignment process included redirecting certain engineering activities  and reorganizing sales  marketing and applications to strengthen major account support 
as part of the realignment  we reduced our workforce by employees 
expenses related to the discontinuance of the a development efforts were million  consisting of severance costs and asset impairment charges 
on may  we undertook a restructuring effort that eliminated approximately additional positions in all operational segments of the company  and consolidated some functions at our san jose headquarters 
opportunities and challenges our operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to the level  timing  cancellation or rescheduling of customer orders  changes in market demand  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and cost  market acceptance of our products  economic conditions specific to the networking and wireless industries and markets  and general economic conditions 
as a result of competitive pricing pressures we have experienced lower margins in our wireless products  and we expect these pricing pressures to continue 
in addition  the wireless and computer networking markets have undergone a period of rapid growth and consolidation in recent years 
we expect our dependence on sales to computer network equipment manufacturers to continue 
as a result  our business would suffer in the event of a significant slowdown in the networking equipment market 
we intend to try to offset these pricing pressures by continuing to introduce new wireless products commanding higher average selling prices 
in addition  we operate in a turnkey manufacturing environment 
consequently our manufacturing infrastructure is scalable  and we would expect some margin improvement by driving higher shipment volumes 
the wireless and computer equipment networking markets in which we compete are characterized by continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
to address these challenges  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability  are cost effective  and brought to market in a timely manner 
successful engineering development and market penetration in the product areas we have chosen require high levels of engineering and product development expense 
we have sometimes experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
as we do not currently manufacture our own semiconductor wafers  we are vulnerable to process technology advances competitors use to manufacture products offering higher performance and lower cost 
to address these challenges  we intend to pursue various opportunities 
for example  we intend to continue to spend significant amounts of resources on new product and technology development  including wireless semiconductors in the three major ism bands  including mhz  ghz  and ghz 
we intend to broaden our markets into many streaming wireless applications such as wireless speakers and headphones  security cameras  game controllers  cordless headsets and cordless telephones 
we also intend to 
table of contents leverage our existing intellectual property in the development of new products to reduce technical risk and development cycle time and to develop customer and strategic relationships in our target markets to strengthen our competitive position 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived and intangible assets revenue recognition we recognize revenue of product shipped directly to oem customers at the time of shipment  provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we defer recognition of revenue from sales of our products to distributors under agreements which allow certain rights of return and price adjustments on unsold inventory 
the associated cost of product on these sales to distributors is also deferred and included in our inventory balances 
revenue and cost of product is recognized when the distributor resells the product to its customers 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for expected product returns 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we analyze historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
there were no allowances for returns recorded at december  estimating accrued liabilities and allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of accrued liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer  as determined by an evaluation of the customer s financial statements  credit rating  bank and credit references 
we do not generally require collateral from the customer 
for certain international customers  we obtain letters of credit or cash payments in advance of shipment 
allowances for potential credit losses are established based on management s review of individual accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  an unexpected change in a major customer s ability to meet its obligation could have an adverse material effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory we value inventories at the lower of standard cost or market 
standard costs are periodically adjusted to approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
this allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon our review of demand for our products in light of projected sales  current market conditions  and market trends 
if a significant  unanticipated decrease in demand for our products or significant technological development occurs  we may deem it necessary to provide for additional inventory reserves  which may have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax planning strategies and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  it is reflected as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance or release existing allowances  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas retained the fundamental provisions of sfas  which required that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of  we completed an impairment review of our land and buildings 
the review was undertaken due to an unsolicited offer to purchase our facilities  continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets  local vacancy rates and recent real estate transactions in our local market 
upon completion of our review  we determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million to write down the assets to their current estimated market value 
in fiscal year  we wrote down of impaired capitalized software primarily due to the discontinuation our a broadband wireless program 
results of operations revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product shipped directly to oem customers at the time of shipment 
during  our top ten oem customers collectively accounted for approximately of net revenues 
we defer recognition of revenues and costs of our products to distributors until the distributor resells the product to its customers 
sales to uniden pass through an international distributor  and are recognized as revenue upon the distributor s resale to the end customer 
however  these sales are classified as oem in percent of net revenue presentation  since the distributor does not fulfill a traditional distributor stocking role for this customer 
in 
table of contents  sales through domestic distributors represented of net revenues 
total international sales through international distributors  exclusive of sales to uniden  represented of net revenues 
results of operations the following table presents certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated for the years ended december  in thousands net revenues wireless networking total net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations interest income and other  net loss before provision for taxes provision benefit for taxes net loss net revenues change change to to in thousands wireless networking total wireless product revenues decreased in despite a increase in unit shipments compared to the decrease is due to price erosion on wireless products offset only slightly by the increase in volume shipments 
we would normally expect to offset the price erosion on mature products by introducing new generations of wireless products that command higher prices and generate higher gross margins 
however  our engineering efforts for and most of were centered on our a broadband wireless project that was cancelled in october there were very few new wireless products introduced during this time and prices on existing wireless products continued to decline due to competitive pressures in the consumer markets we serve 
we anticipate that the trend of falling average selling prices for our wireless products will begin to reverse in with the introduction and ramp up in unit shipment volumes of our ghz products 
although we expect that prices on these new products will fall as the product matures  we intend to continue to introduce new generations of wireless products throughout that will again command higher average selling prices and offset the cycle of price erosion that we expect will continue as our wireless products mature 

table of contents we initially introduced our wireless products during  and the increase in wireless revenues to million in  from million in  was due primarily to having a full year of volume shipments 
our networking product revenues continued to decrease as demand for our legacy products tapered off 
unit shipments of our networking products decreased in compared to the decrease in shipment volumes combined with a decrease in average selling prices of  due mainly to a shift in product mix  resulted in a decrease in net revenues of in compared to although there may be some continued decline in unit volume shipments we do not expect to experience the same dramatic decline in that we experienced in international revenues for totaled million  or of net revenues  compared to million  or of net revenues  for  and million  or of net revenues  for domestic revenues were approximately of net revenues for  compared to for and for the increase in international revenues as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to sales of our wireless products to uniden corporation 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for the substantial majority of our total revenues in the next twelve months 
in fiscal and  uniden corporation accounted for of net revenues 
in fiscal  uniden corporation and allied telesyn international accounted for and of net revenues  respectively 
although our strategy is to engage large customers for new design wins  we expect that uniden corporation will continue to be our largest customer during the next twelve months 
gross margin change change to to in thousands gross margin gross margins are affected by the volume of product shipments  selling prices  product mix  manufacturing subcontract costs  manufacturing utilization  and product yields 
it is also periodically affected by costs incurred in connection with start up and installation of new process technologies at outside manufacturing foundries 
the decrease in gross margin in  compared to  stems mainly from the decrease in the average selling prices of our wireless products and to a lesser extent the shift in product mix of our networking products 
the margin decreases were slightly offset by decreases in manufacturing subcontract costs realized through a combination of a decrease in the costs of our silicon wafers and efficiencies realized in the costs to test our products 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted in by low yields on one of our wireless products that was shipping in volume in the second and third quarters 
we have now identified and fixed the manufacturing problems that caused the low yields on this product and we have already realized an improvement in yields and gross margin in the fourth quarter of fixed manufacturing overhead spending decreased by million in to million  however  it remained at of net revenues due to the overall decrease in revenue in we expect these fixed costs to increase in due to costs associated with the introduction of our new products  however  we anticipate that the overall ratio of these costs to net revenue will remain relatively flat  or decrease slightly in the higher gross margin percentage in compared to was primarily due to a million reduction of fixed manufacturing overhead spending  to million  or of net revenues in  from million  or of net revenues  in the reduced costs and higher revenue base over which these costs are spread had a positive margin impact in compared to this positive margin impact  resulting from lower overhead costs  was partially offset by an increase in the overall weighting of wireless revenues in our revenue mix in compared to average gross margins on our wireless products are lower than those of our networking products 

table of contents research and development expenses r d change change to to in thousands r d research and development expenses include costs associated with the definition  design and development of new products 
in addition  research and development expenses include test development and prototype costs associated with new product development 
we expense wafers and new production mask sets related to new products as research and development costs until products based on new designs are fully characterized  support published data sheets and satisfy reliability tests 
the decrease in our expenses was mainly due to our restructuring efforts implemented in may we reduced engineering headcount as part of these restructuring efforts and consolidated most of the design and testing activities in our san jose headquarters 
we also maintain a small design group located in salt lake city  utah 
in planning our headcount reductions  we carefully reviewed and focused our product roadmap 
we expect to continue spending significant funds on research and development activities to deliver leading edge products that have a promise of high volume shipments within a short time following their introduction 
selling  general and administrative sg a change change to to in thousands sg a the decrease of million  or  in was primarily a result of the restructuring efforts we undertook in may and the associated headcount reductions across all selling  general and administrative functions 
these cost reductions were offset somewhat by the increase in costs associated with marketing prototypes for new products 
the decrease of million  or in compared to  was primarily due to lower spending for supplies  outside services  consulting  legal and facilities 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses could rise in the future  due mainly to higher marketing and selling expenses incurred in connection with the introduction of new products 
fixed asset impairment and restructuring charges in the third quarter of  we completed an impairment review of our land and buildings 
the review was undertaken due to an unsolicited offer to purchase our facilities  continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets  local vacancy rates and recent real estate transactions in our local market 
upon completion of our review  we determined that the carrying values of these assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million to write down the assets to their current estimated market value 
in fiscal year  we wrote down of impaired capitalized software primarily due to the discontinuation of the a broadband wireless program 
table of contents in the second quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan to better align our organizational structure with current business conditions 
this realignment process included workforce reductions across all functions of the company s operations and a consolidation of our design centers into our san jose facility 
restructuring charges and related utilization for the fiscal year ended december  were as follows severance excess and benefits facilities total in thousands amount paid during non cash charges amounts payable as of december  total charges l  the restructuring charge in the second quarter of was approximately million  consisting primarily of employee severance and related termination costs of million and a fixed asset impairment charge of million for assets to be disposed of due to headcount reductions and vacating facilities 
additional charges in the third quarter of were aprroximately million  consisting primarily of employee termination and relocation expenses 
interest and other income and interest expense change change to to in thousands interest and other income interest and other expense the decrease in interest and other income from to was primarily due to the reduction in interest income affected by changes in our cash balances 
the decrease in interest and other income from to was primarily due to the reduction in interest income affected by changes in our cash balances as well as the decline in prevailing interest rates 
the decrease in interest and other expense from to was due primarily to a million charge in for a discount granted to accelerate the payment of a note receivable that was issued to us by the purchaser of our test operations in april provision benefit for income taxes change change to to in thousands our effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rate for is primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  and taxes associated with our uk operations 
the effective rate for is primarily due to tax refunds resulting from a tax law change in that allowed us to carryback net operating losses to prior years 
the effective rate for is due primarily to the recording of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as of december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities during was primarily due to our million net loss  offset by a non recurring non cash charge of million recorded for impairment in the value of our san jose facilities and non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million 
in addition  during we collected million in income tax refunds due to net operating loss carrybacks that were recorded in cash used in operating activities during also included cash provided by an increase in our accounts payable balances of million  million of which related to a customer refund due for products which were returned in december 
these favorable cash items were offset by a decrease in deferred revenue of million and a million decrease in accrued liabilities due in large part to a decrease in a legal accrual related to the successful outcome of the pioneer litigation 
the net loss in included a million tax benefit primarily due to the carryback of net operating losses to profitable years  million of which was received in tax refunds in the million net loss  decrease in accrued liabilities of million  and decrease in deferred revenue of million were the primary components of cash used in these were offset by million of non cash depreciation and amortization and a million reduction in inventories 
the million of cash used in operating activities in was due primarily to the net loss of million  an increase in inventories of million and a million decrease in accrued liabilities 
these uses of cash were somewhat offset by the favorable cash impact in from non cash charges of million resulting from an increase in valuation reserves related to deferred tax assets  and million of non cash depreciation and amortization 
in addition  during we collected receivables and purchased inventories on behalf of fairchild semiconductor corporation related to certain product lines sold to them in september the net effect of these transactions  in addition to the change in our other current assets  had a million positive cash impact 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided during consisted primarily of net proceeds from sales of short term investments 
in  cash used for capital expenditures increased to million compared to million in as we continued to purchase mostly r d related equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to million in cash received on the note receivable from artest corporation for test equipment sold to them in and million in net sales of short term investments  offset by million in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by or used in financing activities the net cash provided by financing activities in  and was primarily from proceeds on issuance of the company s common stock 
this was offset by principal paydowns of approximately  each year on the company s note payable  secured by its building located in san jose  california 

table of contents contractual obligations by year building inventory operating and year loan commitment facility leases total in thousands thereafter total long term debt includes principal and interest 
working capital was million at december   including cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
cash flows for were impacted by million in costs for the restructuring we completed in the first half of cash utilization in the second half of  subsequent to the restructuring  totaled million 
compared to  spending is now approximately million lower per quarter  significantly reducing our breakeven point 
we anticipate that existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment  and provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional wafer fabrication capacity from existing foundry suppliers or new suppliers  capital expenditures  the level of our product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected our operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly 
they may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
our operating results are difficult to predict and have fluctuated significantly in the past 
they are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include the level and timing of spending by our customers  both in the us and in foreign markets  changes in market demand  including seasonal and cyclical fluctuations  timing  amount  cancellation or rescheduling of customer orders  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  timing of revenue recognition from contracts  which may span several quarters  competitive market conditions  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products by us  or competitors  or both  any delay in the introduction of new or enhanced products by us  market acceptance of our new products and continuing demand for our existing products  
table of contents cost and availability of wafers  other components and testing services  mix of products sold  fluctuations in end user demand for wireless products manufactured by our customers which incorporate our technology  economic conditions specific to the networking and wireless industries and markets  as well as general economic conditions  ability to hire and retain qualified technical and other personnel  development of new industry standard communication protocols  and availability and performance of advanced silicon process technologies from foundry sources 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as an indication of our future performance 
if our operating results in one or more future periods fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate  possibly by a significant amount 
the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive  and many competitors are larger and more established 
if we do not compete successfully  our business could be harmed 
intense international and domestic competition  decreasing selling prices  rapid technological change  short product life cycles and cyclical patterns characterize the markets for our products 
competitors include significantly larger corporations 
new entrants in these markets could provide additional competition 
most of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these large organizations are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in these markets 
they often have broader product lines and market focus  and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market 
in addition  many competitors have focused on the wireless market for longer than we have  and therefore have more long standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers 
the computer networking equipment and wireless markets have undergone a period of rapid growth and consolidation in recent years 
we expect our dependence on sales to digital cordless phone and network equipment manufacturers to continue 
our business and results of operations would be harmed in the event of a significant slowdown in the digital cordless phone or computer networking equipment market 
in addition  as a result of competitive pricing pressures  we have experienced lower margins on some of our products 
such pricing pressures will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations  and our business could suffer unless they can be offset by higher margins on other products or lower operating expenses 
we do not currently manufacture our own semiconductor wafers 
as a result  we are vulnerable to process technology advances competitors use to manufacture products offering higher performance and lower cost 
larger companies with wafer manufacturing facilities  broader product lines  greater technical and financial resources and greater service and support capabilities have an advantage in this market 
in addition  our products are generally sole sourced to our customers 
if our customers were to develop other sources for our products  our operating results would be harmed 
the market for wireless applications is characterized by rapid technological change 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to these changes 
rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards make it difficult to accurately predict the market s future growth rate  size or technological direction 
in view of the evolving nature of this market  suppliers of wireless products may decide to adopt alternative standards or technologies that are incompatible with our products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture and sell products that are compatible with these new standards or technologies  our business and operating results would be harmed 

table of contents we need to develop and introduce new and enhanced products in a timely manner to successfully compete in our industry 
continuing technological advancement  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards characterize the wireless and computer equipment networking markets 
to compete successfully  we must design  develop  manufacture and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability  meet performance or other objective specified parameters  are cost effective  are brought to market in a timely manner  are in accordance with existing or evolving industry standards  and achieve market acceptance 
the development of these new circuits is highly complex 
we have sometimes experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on many factors  including proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  acceptable manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
we must be able to adjust to changing market conditions quickly and cost effectively to compete successfully 
furthermore  we must introduce new products in a timely manner  and achieve market acceptance for these products 
in addition  our customers products which incorporate our products must be introduced in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance 
if we  or our customers  fail to develop and introduce new products successfully  our business and operating results would suffer 
to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products  we may need to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we cannot enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  our ability to develop and market new products could suffer  and our business and operating results would be adversely affected 
customers typically take a long time to evaluate our new products 
it takes three to six months or more for customers to test new products  and at least an additional three to months until customers begin significant production of products incorporating our products 
we may therefore experience a lengthy delay between product development and the generation of revenues from new products 
delays inherent in such a long sales cycle raise additional risks that customers may decide to cancel or change their product plans 
such changes could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition  and results of operations would suffer if customers reduce or delay orders  or choose not to release products incorporating our products 
we have a history of losses and  because of continued investment in product development  expect to incur losses in the future 
we may not become profitable 
we have incurred quarterly net losses from june through december  except for a profit in the third quarter of which was attributable to an income tax refund 
because of those losses  we had an accumulated deficit of  as of december  successful engineering development and market penetration in the product areas we have chosen to compete in require high levels of engineering and product development expense 
we intend to continue to spend significant amounts on new product and technology development 
our networking products are reaching 
table of contents maturity  and revenue from this product line has declined and is expected to decline further over the next twelve months 
we anticipate that our existing cash will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment  and provide adequate working capital for at least the next months 
we expect to incur losses in the future and may not achieve our goals of positive net income and cash flow 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional capital 
if funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to hire or retain employees  fund our operations or compete effectively 
we believe that our existing capital resources and cash generated from operations will enable us to maintain our operations for at least the next months 
however  if our capital requirements or results of operations vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available to us on acceptable terms  our ability to hire  train or retain employees  to fund our operations and sales and marketing efforts  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we depend on networking  wireless  and telecommunications spending for our revenue 
any decrease or delay in spending in these industries would negatively impact future operating results and financial condition 
demand for our products in the future will depend on the amount and timing of spending by network providers  manufacturers of wireless consumer products  and telecommunications equipment suppliers 
spending in these areas depends upon a variety of factors  including competitive pressures  discretionary consumer spending patterns  and general economic conditions 
during and and  new orders slowed  customers cancelled or placed holds on existing orders  and orders dropped from prior periods  due to developments in the general economy and capital markets 
this situation could recur in the future 
because the majority of our revenue comes from sales to a few customers  a delay in orders from one customer could have a significant negative effect on future revenues 
relatively short product life cycles characterize the computer network equipment and digital cordless telephone markets 
if one or more of our significant customers were to select circuits manufactured by a competitor for future products  our business would suffer 
the loss of one or more of our current customers  failure to attract new customers  or disruption of our sales and distribution channels could harm our business and operating results 
our customer base is concentrated 
the loss of one or more key customers or distributors would harm our business 
a significant majority of our revenue comes from sales to relatively few customers 
sales to the ten largest customers  excluding domestic distributors  in   and accounted for approximately   and of net revenue  respectively 
sales to domestic distributors in   and accounted for approximately   and of net revenue 
we anticipate that a limited number of key customers and distributors will continue to provide a significant portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our current customers and attract new customers 
a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more significant customers could materially harm our operating results 
in addition  our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources for the products we now supply them 
generally  customers may cancel or reschedule orders to purchase standard products without significant penalty until days prior to requested shipment 
customers frequently revise delivery schedules  and the 
table of contents quantities of products to be delivered  to reflect changes in their needs 
since backlog can be canceled or rescheduled  our backlog at any time is not necessarily indicative of future revenue 
we depend on international sales and are subject to the risks associated with international operations  which may negatively affect our business 
sales to customers outside of the united states in   and represented   and of net revenue  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to generate a substantial proportion of net revenue for the foreseeable future 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks  including changes in regulations and laws of foreign governments and telecommunications standards  import and export legislation and license requirements  tariffs  taxes  quotas and other trade barriers  compliance with foreign laws  treaties and technical standards  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  difficulty in managing foreign operations  loss of one or more international distributors  geopolitical risks  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and economic instability  and the effects of the terrorist attacks on the united states  the war in iraq  the united states war on international terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide 
substantially all of our international sales must be licensed by the office of export administration of the us department of commerce 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties in obtaining export licenses 
our international sales are typically denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country  while competitors products denominated in local currencies become less expensive 
this may lead to a reduction in sales or profitability in that country  which could adversely affect our business 
gains and losses on the conversion to us dollars of accounts receivable  accounts payable and other international assets and liabilities may contribute to fluctuations in operating results 
in addition  international customers typically take longer to pay for purchases than customers in the united states 
if foreign markets do not continue to develop  or foreign sales cycles prove unpredictable  our revenue and business would be adversely affected 
selling prices for wireless products typically decrease  which could lead to lower operating results 
average selling prices for products in the wireless markets have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  price performance enhancements  product introductions by competitors  price pressure from significant customers  and product maturity and obsolescence 

table of contents the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we continue to develop and market new products that incorporate valued new features and sell at higher prices 
failure to deliver new products offering increased value would result in a decline in both revenue and margins  harming our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
defects in our products  product returns and product liability could result in a decrease in customers and revenue  unexpected expenses and loss of market share 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects  and bugs upon release 
despite thorough testing by micro linear  our test houses and customers  these errors  defects and bugs are sometimes discovered after we begin to ship products 
we expend significant resources to remedy these problems  but occasionally have faced legal claims by customers and others 
product defects can also cause interruptions  delays or cancellations of sales to customers  in addition to claims against us  all of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on the health of the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical 
the decline in demand in the semiconductor industry could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry experiences significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry also experiences significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this causes significant variances in product demand and production capacity  and aggravates both our manufacturing costs and product selling prices 
these cyclical patterns  which we expect to continue  may substantially harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately forecast demand for our products  we may incur product shortages or excess product inventory 
we regularly request indications from customers as to their future plans and requirements  to ensure that we will be prepared to meet production demand for our products 
however  we may not receive anticipated purchase orders for our products 
we must be able to effectively manage the expenses and inventory risks associated with meeting potential demand 
if we fail to meet customers supply expectations  we may lose business from such customers 
if we expend resources and purchase materials  or enter into commitments to acquire materials and manufacture products  and customers do not purchase these products  our business and operating results would suffer 
design wins  which require significant expenditures  often precede the generation of volume sales by a year or more 
the value of any design win will largely depend upon the commercial success of the customer s product  and on the extent to which the design of the customer s product accommodates components manufactured by our competitors 
we cannot assure that we will achieve design wins  or that any design win will result in significant future revenue 
we depend on a limited number of outside foundries and test subcontractors in the manufacturing process  and any failure to obtain sufficient foundry or testing capacity could significantly delay our ability to ship our products  damage our customer relationships  and result in reduced revenue 
we utilize outside foundries for all wafer production 
we believe that utilizing outside foundries enable us to focus on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and access diverse manufacturing technologies 
we currently intend to continue to rely exclusively upon our outside foundries for our wafer fabrication requirements 
however  there are significant risks associated with the reliance on outside foundries  including the lack of assured wafer supply and control over delivery schedules  delays in obtaining access to key process technologies  and limited control over manufacturing yields and production costs 
the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technically demanding process 
we have diversified our sources of wafer supply and have worked closely with our foundries to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields 
however  our foundries have sometimes experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and 
table of contents start up of new processes 
reduced yields have  at times  negatively affected our operating results  a situation which may recur in the future 
dependence on foundries located outside of the united states subjects us to numerous risks  including exchange rate fluctuations  export and import restrictions  trade sanctions  political instability and tariff increases 
one of our main foundries is located in singapore  which presents specific risks due to political instability in that region 
we purchase wafers from outside foundries pursuant to customers purchase orders 
we generally do not have a guaranteed level of wafer capacity or wafer costs at our foundries 
our wafer suppliers could prioritize capacity for other uses  or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
in addition  we depend upon a limited number of foundries for our wafer requirements 
any sudden demand for an increased amount of wafers  or sudden reduction or elimination of any source of wafers  could result in a material delay in the shipment of products 
disruptions in supply  which have occurred in the past  may occur in the future 
if such a disruption occurred  and we were unable to qualify alternative manufacturing sources for our products in a timely manner  or if such sources were unable to produce wafers with acceptable manufacturing yields  our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we rely on four outside test service subcontractors to test our products 
the same risks described in the paragraphs above  concerning guaranteed capacity  dependence upon a limited number of test service subcontractors  and disruptions in service  also apply to our test and assembly subcontractors 
rapid technological change and frequent new product introductions characterize the markets for our products 
to remain competitive  we must develop or obtain access to new semiconductor process technologies in order to reduce die size  increase die performance and functional complexity  and improve manufacturing yields 
if we are unable to obtain access to advanced wafer processing technologies  limiting our ability to introduce competitive products on a timely basis  our future operating results would be harmed 
minute levels of contaminants in the semiconductor manufacturing environment  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer  difficulties in the fabrication process and other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
many of these manufacturing problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming and expensive to remedy 
our foundries have  at times  experienced lower than anticipated yields  which have adversely affected production and operating results 
the manufacturing processes utilized by our foundries are continuously being improved in order to increase yield and product performance 
process changes can  however  result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields 
new process technologies and new products are especially susceptible to wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
irregularities  adverse yield fluctuations or other manufacturing problems at our foundries could result in production interruption or delivery delays  which would harm our business and results of operations 
we have granted nontransferable  limited process licenses to some of our foundries to utilize our processes to manufacture and sell wafers to other customers 
we protect our proprietary technology  particularly our design methodology  but may not be able to prevent its misappropriation by our foundries or others 
we and the independent foundries and subcontractors we use to manufacture and test our products are subject to environmental laws 
failure to comply with these laws could delay manufacturing of our products and result in unexpected expenses 
our wafer suppliers and test and assembly subcontractors are subject to a variety of us and foreign government regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in their manufacturing processes 
failure by our suppliers or subcontractors to comply with environmental regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
environmental regulations could also require our suppliers or subcontractors to acquire equipment or incur other expenses to 
table of contents comply with environmental regulations 
if our suppliers or subcontractors incur substantial additional expenses  product costs could significantly increase  adversely affecting our results of operations 
we are also subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to our operations 
if we fail to comply with present and future regulations  the government could impose fines on us  or compel us to suspend or cease operations 
if we or our suppliers or subcontractors fail to control the use or discharge of hazardous substances  we could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities  which could harm our business and operating results 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel  which could have an impact upon the development or sales of our products 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  especially those with engineering design experience and expertise 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such qualified personnel 
competitors may attempt to recruit our employees 
while employees are required to sign standard agreements concerning confidentiality and ownership of inventions  we do not have employment contracts or non competition agreements with most of our personnel 
the loss of the services of key employees  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  or delays in hiring personnel  particularly engineers and other technical personnel could negatively affect our business and prevent us from achieving our business goals 
our success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we own twelve us patents  and have five us patent applications and ten foreign patent applications pending 
through a sale of a portion of our assets  we maintain a royalty free license to forty five us patents  three foreign patents  seven us patent applications  and three foreign patent applications 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  licensing arrangements  maintaining certain technology as trade secrets and other measures 
however  any patent  trademark  copyright or other intellectual property rights we own may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
we cannot be certain that our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages  or that any pending or future patent applications will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by us 
competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around the patents that we own 
in addition  effective patent  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries in which we do business 
we believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate technological expertise and innovation into new and enhanced products 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  vendors and customers  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may not be able to prevent the misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  we have taken legal action to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  protect our trade secrets  determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  and defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
if a third party makes a valid claim  and we cannot obtain a license to the technology on reasonable terms  our operations could be harmed 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  including claims of alleged infringement of the proprietary rights and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming  and could divert our management s attention away from running our business 
we have in the past  and may in the future  be parties to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial impact on us 
in december  pioneer magnetics  inc pioneer filed a complaint in the federal district court for the central district of california alleging that certain of our integrated circuits violate a pioneer patent 

table of contents pioneer sought monetary damages and an injunction against the alleged patent violation 
the district court concluded that micro linear did not infringe on pioneer s patent 
pioneer then appealed the district court s decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit  which affirmed the district court judgment 
in may  pioneer filed a petition for appeal with the supreme court 
on june   the supreme court granted the petition  vacated the judgment  and remanded the case to the court of appeals for further consideration  in light of the recently decided case of festo corp 
v 
shoketsu kinzoku kogyo kabushiki 
on june   the court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the district court s judgment 
pioneer s only right of appeal was to the supreme court through a writ of certiorari 
pioneer did not exercise their right of appeal within the statutory time limit and therefore  this case has now been concluded in our favor 
from time to time we have received correspondence from vendors  distributors  customers or end users of our products regarding disputes with respect to contract rights  product performance or other matters that occur in the ordinary course of business 
some of these disputes may involve us in costly litigation or other actions  the outcome of which cannot be determined in advance and may adversely affect our business 
the defense of lawsuits or other actions could divert our management s attention away from running our business 
in addition  negative developments with respect to litigation could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile because of stock market fluctuations that affect the price of technology stocks 
a decline in our stock price could result in securities class action litigation against us  which could divert management s attention and harm our business 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
between january  and december   our stock price has closed as high as on december   and as low as on june  our stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including variations in our actual or anticipated operating results  sales of substantial amounts of our stock  announcements about us or about our competitors  including technological innovation or new products  litigation and other developments relating to our patents or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors  conditions in the computer networking equipment and wireless markets  governmental regulation and legislation  and changes in securities analysts estimates of our performance  or our failure to meet analysts expectations 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market prices of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the objects of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  stockholder rights plan and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a change in control  even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws  the shareholder rights plan  our stock option plans and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire 
table of contents us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
under the shareholder rights plan  adopted in august  each share of our outstanding common stock carries one right to purchase of a share of series a participating preferred stock at an exercise price of per right 
if someone acquires or more of our common stock  each right not owned by a holder of or more of our common stock entitles the holder  upon payment of the exercise price  to receive common stock having a current market value of 
this issuance of additional common stock would significantly reduce the percentage of common stock held by a potential acquirer 
the rights expire in august in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of micro linear 
specifically  section prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met 
also  in the event outstanding options granted pursuant to certain of our stock option plans are not assumed by an acquiring corporation  the unvested portion of such options may be accelerated upon a change of control 
in addition  some individual stock option grants provide for the partial or complete acceleration of vesting upon a change of control 
recently enacted regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the sec and nasdaq  could cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new and proposed rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of us government obligations  commercial paper and money market funds  typically with maturities of less than months see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
some of these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december  and december   the fair market value of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we intend to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  do not expect to recognize an adverse impact from interest rate changes on income or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk our international sales are significant in relation to our total sales and are  therefore  subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
we limit our foreign currency risks principally by maintaining minimal foreign currency balances 
to date  our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant
