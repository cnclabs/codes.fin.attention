the following is an analysis of pepco holdings short term debt as of december  and as of december  in millions type phi pepco dpl ace ace funding conectiv energy pci conectiv pepco holdings consolidated variable rate demand bonds current portion of long term debt construction loan floating rate note commercial paper total as of december  in millions type phi pepco dpl ace ace funding conectiv energy pci conectiv pepco holdings consolidated variable rate demand bonds current portion of long term debt construction loan floating rate note commercial paper total cash flow activity during  million in cash was provided from operating activities  million in cash was used by investing activities  and million of cash was used by financing activities  resulting in an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents during the year to million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents were million 
because the purchase method of accounting was used to record the august  acquisition of conectiv by pepco  phi s cash flow activities during the years   and are not comparable 
capital requirements construction expenditures pepco holdings construction expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million of which million was related to its power delivery businesses and the remainder related to conectiv energy 
for the five year period through  total construction expenditures are projected to be approximately billion  of which approximately billion is related to the power delivery businesses 
this amount includes estimated costs for environmental compliance by phi s subsidiaries 
see item business environmental matters 
pepco holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash from the power delivery businesses 
dividends pepco holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration  among other factors  current and possible future developments that may affect phi s income and cash flows 
phi s board of directors declared quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock payable on march   june   september  and december  under puhca  phi is prohibited  without sec approval  from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus 
phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
in addition to their future financial performance  the ability of phi s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by i state corporate and regulatory laws  which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and  in the case of regulatory laws  as applicable  may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid  ii puhca  which prohibits a subsidiary of a registered public utility holding company from paying a dividend out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior approval of the sec  iii the prior rights of holders of existing and futu re preferred stock  mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries  and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities  and iv certain provisions of the charters of pepco  dpl and ace  which impose restrictions on payment of common stock dividends for the benefit of preferred stockholders 
pepco s articles of incorporation and dpl s certificate and articles of incorporation each contains provisions restricting the amount of dividends that can be paid on common stock when preferred stock is outstanding if the applicable company s capitalization ratio is less than 
for this purpose  the capitalization ratio is equal to i common stock capital plus surplus  divided by ii total capital including long term debt plus surplus 
in addition  dpl s certificate and articles of incorporation and ace s certificate of incorporation each provides that if preferred stock is outstanding  no dividends may be paid on common stock if  after payment  the applicable company s common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock 
currently  none of these charter restrictions limits the ability of pepco  dpl or ace to pay dividends 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl  ace and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
following the consummation of the acquisition of conectiv by pepco on august   the pepco general retirement plan and the conectiv retirement plan were merged into the retirement plan on december  the provisions and benefits of the merged retirement plan applicable to pepco employees are identical to those in the original pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to dpl and ace employees are identical to those in the original conectiv plan 
as of the valuation  the retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without any additional funding 
however  phi s funding policy with regard to the retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accrued benefit obligation 
in and  phi made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the retirement plan in accordance with its funding policy 
in  the accumulated benefit obligation for the retirement plan increased over  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation  which reflected the declining interest rate environment in however  the financial markets experienced a recovery during  and the retirement plan assets achieved returns in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  in october phi contributed a total of million of which million was funded by pepco and million funded by ace to the retirement plan 
the contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions  the funding level at year end would be in excess of of the accrued benefit obligation 
in  phi contributed a total of million all of which was funded by pepco to the retirement plan 
phi currently estimates that no contributions will be required i n to maintain a funding level in excess of of the accumulated benefit obligation 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary information about pepco holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   is as follows contractual maturity obligation total less than year years years after years dollars in millions short term debt variable rate demand bonds long term debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption capital and operating leases purchase power contracts total third party guarantees  indemnifications and off balance sheet arrangements pepco holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below 
as of december   pepco holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit  performance residual value  and other commitments and obligations 
the fair value of these commitments and obligations was not required to be recorded in pepco holdings consolidated balance sheets  however  certain energy marketing obligations of conectiv energy were recorded 
the commitments and obligations  in millions of dollars  were as follows guarantor phi conectiv pci total energy marketing obligations of conectiv energy energy procurement obligations of pepco energy services standby letters of credit of pepco holdings guaranteed lease residual values loan agreement construction performance guarantees other total pepco holdings and conectiv have contractual commitments for performance and related payments of conectiv energy and pepco energy services to counterparties related to routine energy sales and procurement obligations  including requirements under bgs contracts for ace 
pepco holdings has issued standby letters of credit of million on behalf of subsidiary operations related to conectiv energy s competitive energy activities and third party construction performance 
these standby letters of credit were put into place in order to allow the subsidiaries the flexibility needed to conduct business with counterparties without having to post substantial cash collateral 
while the exposure under these standby letters of credit is million  pepco holdings does not expect to fund the full amount 
subsidiaries of conectiv have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value related to certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements 
as of december   obligations under the guarantees were approximately million 
assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from years to years 
historically  payments under the guarantee have not been made by the guarantor as  under normal conditions  the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal 
as such  phi believes the likelihood of requiring payment under the guarantee is remote 
pepco holdings has issued a guarantee on behalf of a subsidiary s unconsolidated investment in a limited liability company for repayment of borrowings under a loan agreement of approximately million 
conectiv has performance obligations of million relating to obligations to third party suppliers of equipment 
other guarantees comprise o pepco holdings has guaranteed payment of a bond issued by a subsidiary of million 
pepco holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee

in addition  in connection with the conectiv bethlehem revolving credit agreement  conectiv provides a guarantee associated with conectiv energy s agreement to purchase energy and capacity from conectiv bethlehem and other guarantees related to obligations of pepco holdings subsidiaries under agreements related to constructing and operating the conectiv bethlehem mid merit plant 
generally  conectiv s guarantee obligations do not exceed the amount of the debt outstanding under the credit agreement and do not guarantee conectiv bethlehem s obligation to repay the debt 
as of december   the outstanding balance under the conectiv bethlehem credit facility was million 
pepco holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties 
these indemnification agreements typically cover environmental  tax  litigation and other matters  as well as breaches of representations  warranties and covenants set forth in the agreements 
typically  claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim 
the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction 
the total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors  including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities 
contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and other transactions  the affected company may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the applicable company are downgraded one or more levels 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
as of december   a one level downgrade in the credit rating of phi and all of its affected subsidiaries would have required phi and such subsidiaries to provide aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit of approximately up to million 
an additional approximately million of aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit would have been required in the event of subsequent downgrades to below investment grade 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels that are in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements 
as of december   pepco holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities were in receipt of a net holder of cash collateral in the amount of million in connection with their competitive energy activities 
environmental remediation obligations phi s accrued liabilities as of december  include approximately million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  for potential cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party  is alleged to be a third party contributor  or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property 
for information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities  see business environmental matters 
the principal environmental remediation obligations as of december   were million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl for remediation and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the indian river power plant that was sold on june   reflecting the terms of a related consent agreement reached with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control during as a result of the discontinuation of the second competitive bidding process for ace s fossil fuel fired generating stations  ace anticipates that it will incur costs of approximately million and million  respectively  in environmental remediation costs associated with its deepwater generating station and its bl england generating station 
ace established a million reserve for the deepwater related portion of these remediation costs 
in march  ace transferred the ownership of the deepwater generation plant  along with the reserve for deepwater related remediation costs to conectiv energy which has assumed responsibility for the remediation at deepwater 
ace continues to be responsible for the bl england related remediation costs 
in  conectiv energy expects to incur approximately  in such costs associated with deepwater and ace expects to incur  million in such costs associated with bl england 
ace anticipates that costs of cleanup  remediation and restoration in response to a december oil release at bl england will be approximately million  of which  has been accrued as a liability

sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
internally generated cash the primary source of pepco holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business 
a discussion of cash flows for is included above 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco  dpl  and ace have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  up to million  and up to million  respectively

pepco holdings credit limit under these facilities is million  and the credit limit of each of pepco  dpl and ace under these facilities is the lower of million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission  except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by pepco  dpl and ace at any given time under these facilities may not exceed million 
funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes 
either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies 
the three year and day credit agreements contain customary financial and other cov enants that  if not satisfied  could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements 
among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of or less  computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements 
as of december   the applicable ratios for pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace were 
 and  respectively 
the credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements  including i the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due  or the acceleration of  certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements  ii certain bankruptcy events  judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries  and iii a change in cont rol as defined in the credit agreements of pepco holdings or the failure of pepco holdings to own all of the voting stock of pepco  dpl and ace 
conectiv bethlehem entered into a credit agreement with various banks and financial institutions in june in connection with the construction of the bethlehem mid merit power plant 
under this agreement  conectiv bethlehem may borrow up to million as a construction loan and convert the construction loan to a term loan after completing the construction and testing of its mid merit power plant 
conectiv bethlehem expects that the construction loan will convert to a term loan in and that the term loan period will be approximately two years

long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to refund or refinance existing securities 
puhca restrictions because pepco holdings is a public utility holding company registered under puhca  it must obtain sec approval to issue securities 
puhca also prohibits pepco holdings from borrowing from its subsidiaries 
under an sec financing order dated july  the financing order  pepco holdings is authorized to issue equity  preferred securities and debt securities in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion through an authorization period ending june   subject to a ceiling on the effective cost of these funds 
pepco holdings is also authorized to enter into guarantees to third parties or otherwise provide credit support with respect to obligations of its subsidiaries for up to billion 
of this amount  only billion may be on behalf of subsidiaries engaged in energy marketing activities 
pepco holdings may issue common stock to satisfy its obligations under its shareholder dividend reinvestment plan and various employee benefit plans 
under the financing order  pepco holdings is limited to issuing no more than an aggregate of million shares of common stock under its shareholder dividend reinvestment plan and employee benefit plans during the period ending june  the financing order requires that  in order to issue debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  pepco holdings must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization consisting of common stock  preferred stock  if any  long term debt and short term debt of at least percent 
at december   pepco holdings common equity ratio was percent 
the financing order also requires that all rated securities issued by pepco holdings be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
accordingly  if pepco holdings common equity ratio were less than percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade  pepco holdings could not issue the security without first obtaining an amendment to the financing order from the sec 
if an amendment to the financing order is required to enable pepco holdings or any of its subsidiaries to effect a financing  there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of sec action 
the failure to obtain timely relief from the sec  in such circumstances  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of pepco holdings and its subsidiaries 
the foregoing financing limitations also generally apply to pepco  dpl  ace and certain other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
money pool pepco holdings has received sec authorization under puhca to establish the pepco holdings system money pool 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of the phi subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
consequently  pepco holdings external borrowing requirements fluctuate based on the amount of funds required to be deposited in the money pool 
regulatory and other matters relationship with mirant corporation in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant corporation  formerly southern energy  inc as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  mirant 
on july   mirant corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
under bankruptcy law  a debtor generally may  with authorization from a bankruptcy court  assume or reject executory contracts 
a rejection of an executory contract entitles the counterparty to file a claim as an unsecured creditor against the bankruptcy estate for damages incurred due to the rejection of the contract 
in a bankruptcy proceeding  a debtor can normally restructure some or all of its pre petition liabilities 
depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below  the mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of pepco holdings and pepco 
however  management currently believes that pepco holdings and pepco currently have sufficient cash  cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy the additional cash requirements that are expected to arise due to the mirant bankruptcy 
accordingly  management does not anticipate that the mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of pepco holdings or pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures 
on this basis  management currently does not believe that the mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of either company 
transition power agreements as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement for the pepco generation assets the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco and mirant entered into transition power agreements for maryland and the district of columbia  respectively collectively  the tpas 
under these agreements  mirant was obligated to supply pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in maryland through june and its standard offer service obligations in the district of columbia into january  in each case at rates that were lower than the rates that pepco charges to its customers 
the original rates under the tpas were less than the prevailing market rates 
at the time mirant filed for bankruptcy  the purchase prices for energy and capacity under the tpas were below the prevailing market rates 
to avoid the potential rejection of the tpas pepco and mirant corporation and its affiliate mirant americas energy marketing  lp the mirant parties entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the bankruptcy court on november  the settlement agreement 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the mirant parties have assumed both of the tpas and the tpas have been amended  effective october   to increase the purchase price of energy thereunder as described below 
the settlement agreement also provides that pepco has an allowed  pre petition general unsecured claim against each of the mirant parties in the amount of million the pepco tpa claim  and has the right to assert the pepco tpa claim against other mirant debtors 
on december   pepco filed proofs of claim in the amount of million against the appropriate mirant debtors 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  the purchase price of energy under the tpas has increased from to per megawatt hour during summer months may through september and from to per megawatt hour during winter months october through april under the district of columbia tpa and has increased from to per megawatt hour during summer months and from to per megawatt hour during winter months under the maryland tpa 
under the amended tpas  the purchase prices paid by pepco for capacity in the district of columbia and maryland remain per megawatt hour and the charge paid by pepco for certain ancillary services remain 
per megawatt hour 
the amendments to the tpas have resulted in an increase in the average purchase price to pepco for energy from approximately cents per kilowatt hour under the original terms of the tpas to an average purchase price of approximatel y cents per kilowatt hour 
the revenues produced by the currently approved tariff rates that pepco charges its customers for providing standard offer service average approximately cents per kilowatt hour 
pepco estimates that  as a result of the price increases  it will pay mirant an additional million for the purchase of energy beginning october  through the remaining terms of the tpas 
these payments will be offset by a reduction of payments by pepco to customers for the period through of approximately million pursuant to the generation procurement credit established pursuant to regulatory settlements entered into in the district of columbia and maryland under which pepco and its customers share any margin between the price paid by pepco to procure standard offer service and the price paid by customers for standard offer service 
as a result  pepco currently anticipates that it will incur a net additional cash outlay of approximately million due to the amendments of the respective tpas 
the foregoing estimates are based on current service territory load served by competitive suppliers and by standard offer service and does not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to fluctuation 
the amount  if any  that pepco will be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the pepco tpa claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate 
no receivable has been recorded in pepco s accounting records in respect of the pepco tpa claim 
any recovery would be shared with customers pursuant to the generation procurement credit 
power purchase agreements under agreements with firstenergy corp  formerly ohio edison firstenergy  and allegheny energy  inc  both entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from firstenergy megawatts of capacity and energy annually through december the firstenergy ppa 
under an agreement with panda  entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from panda megawatts of capacity and energy annually through the panda ppa 
in each case  the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market prices 
as a part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into a back to back arrangement with mirant 
under this arrangement  mirant is obligated  among other things  to purchase from pepco the capacity and energy that pepco is obligated to purchase under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa at a price equal to the price pepco is obligated to pay under the ppas the ppa related obligations 
pepco pre petition claims when mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on july   mirant had unpaid obligations to pepco of approximately million  consisting primarily of payments due to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations the mirant pre petition obligations 
the mirant pre petition obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding 
pepco has filed proofs of claim in the mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately million to recover this indebtedness  however  the amount of pepco s recovery  if any  is uncertain 
the million difference between mirant s unpaid obligation to pepco and the million proofs of claim filed by pepco primarily represents a tpa settlement adjustment which is included in the million proofs of claim filed by pepco on december  against the mirant debtors 
in view of this uncertainty  pepco  in the third quarter of  expensed million million after tax to establish a reserve against the million receivable from mirant 
the amount expensed represents pepco s estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy  although the amount ultimately recoverable could be higher or lower 
mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations on august   mirant filed with the bankruptcy court a motion seeking authorization to reject its ppa related obligations 
mirant s motion also sought injunctions to prohibit pepco from initiating  or encouraging any person or entity to initiate  any proceedings before the ferc that seek to require mirant to perform the ppa related obligations and to prohibit ferc from taking any action to require mirant to perform the ppa related obligations 
on september   the bankruptcy court entered an order stating that it was not necessary to issue an injunction against pepco because the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code prohibit pepco from commencing or continuing any judicial or administrative proceedings against mirant 
the bankruptcy court s order did grant a preliminary injunction that prohibits ferc from i taking any action to require or coerce mirant to abide by the terms of the ppa related obligations or commencing or continuing any proceeding outside of the bankruptcy court with respect to the ppa related obligations and ii taking any action  or encouraging any person or entity to take an action  to require or coerce mirant to abide by the terms of the tpas 
the bankruptcy court also ordered mirant to continue to perform the ppa related obligations and its obligations under the tpas until relieved of those obligations by an order of an appropriate court 
upon motions filed by pepco and ferc  on october   the us district court for the northern district of texas the district court withdrew jurisdiction over both the rejection and preliminary injunction proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
on december   the district court denied mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations 
on january  mirant filed with the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the circuit court a notice of appeal of the district court s december decision 
on january   the official committee of unsecured creditors of mirant corporation the creditors committee filed with the circuit court a separate notice of appeal of the december decision 
also on january   the district court entered an order dissolving all injunctive relief granted by the bankruptcy court in respect of the ppa related obligations  and mirant and the creditors committee each subsequently filed a motion with the circuit court for a stay of the dissolution order pending resolution of the appeals  as well as motions to expedite the appeals 
on january   the circuit court denied mirant s and the creditors committee s motions to expedite the appeal 
on january   the circuit court denied mirant s and the creditors committee s motions to stay the district court s order 
oral argument will be scheduled the week of may  pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing mirant s continued attempts to reject the ppa related obligations in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders 
while pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements  the outcome of mirant s efforts to reject the ppa related obligations is uncertain 
in accordance with the bankruptcy court s september order  mirant is continuing to perform the ppa related obligations pending the resolution of the ongoing proceedings 
however  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting  and is otherwise permitted to stop performing the ppa related obligations  pepco could be required to repay to mirant  for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection which date could be prior to the date of the court s order and possibly as early as september  and ending on the date mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from pepco  all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity 
pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to mirant in the unlikely event september   is determined to be the effective date of rejection  as of march   is approximately million 
this repayment would entitle pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid 
mirant has also asked the bankruptcy court to require pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity  for the period july  the date on which mirant filed its bankruptcy petition to september   on the theory that mirant did not receive value for those payments 
pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to mirant on the disgorgement theory is approximately million 
pepco believes a claim based on this theory should be entitled to administrative expense status for which comp lete recovery could be expected 
if pepco were required to repay any such amounts for either period  the payment would be expensed at the time the payment is made 
the following are estimates prepared by pepco of its additional exposure if mirant s motion to reject its ppa related obligations ultimately is successful 
these estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity  and do not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation 
the estimates assume no recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery  either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss 
pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries 
based on these assumptions  pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of march   representing the loss of the future benefit of the ppa related obligations to pepco  is as follows if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from firstenergy commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the firstenergy ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  and million in  the last year of the firstenergy ppa 
if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from panda commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents  and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the panda ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  million in  and million in and approximately million to million annually thereafter through the contract termination date 
the ability of pepco to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the mirant pre petition obligations and damages if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether pepco s claims are allowed  the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors and pepco s priority relative to other creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate  whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment  or the timing of any recovery 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations and pepco s full claim is not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  pepco may seek authority from the mpsc and the dcpsc to recover its additional costs 
pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers 
under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the mpsc and the dcpsc in the deregulation proceedings in which pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions  the ppas were to become assets of pepco s distribution business if they could not be sold 
pepco believes that  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the ppas that are not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered through pepco s distribution rates 
if pepco s interpretation o f the settlement agreements is confirmed  pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset 
however  there is no assurance that pepco s interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions 
if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected  and there is no regulatory recovery  pepco will incur a loss 
however  the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors  and is not determinable at this time 
the smeco agreement as a term of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco assigned to mirant a facility and capacity agreement with southern maryland electric cooperative  inc smeco under which pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by smeco at a former pepco generating station the smeco agreement 
the agreement contemplates a monthly payment to smeco of approximately 
million 
pepco is responsible to smeco for the performance of the smeco agreement if mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder 
at this time  mirant continues to make post petition payments due to smeco 
rate proceedings on february   ace filed a petition with the njbpu to increase its electric distribution rates and its regulatory asset recovery charge rarc in new jersey 
the petition was based on actual data for the nine months ended september   and forecasted data for the three months ended december  and sought an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of an approximately million increase in electricity distribution rates and million for recovery of regulatory assets through the rarc 
on october   ace updated the filing with actual data for the full twelve month test year ended december  and made other corrections 
the update supported an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of a million increase in electricity distribution rates and a rarc of million 
this petition is ace s first increase request for electric distribution rates since the requested increase would apply to all rate schedules in ace s tariff 
the ratepayer advocate filed testimony on january   proposing an annual rate decrease of million 
intervenor groups representing industrial users and local generators filed testimony that did not take a position with respect to an overall rate change but their proposals  if implemented  would affect the way in which an overall rate increase or decrease would be applied to the particular rates under which they receive service 
ace s rebuttal testimony  filed february   makes some changes to its october filing and proposes an overall rate increase of approximately million  consisting of a increase in distribution rates and a million increase in the rarc 
on july   the njbpu issued an order transferring to the base rate proceeding consideration of million of actual and projected deferred restructuring costs for which ace was seeking recovery in a separate proceeding  which is discussed below  relating to the restructuring of ace s electric utility business under the new jersey electric discount and energy competition act edeca 
in its october  filing  ace presented testimony supporting recovery of an increase in the amount of deferred restructuring costs recoverable from million to million  consisting of i million associated with bgs costs  ii million of restructuring transition related costs and iii of transition costs related to fossil generation divestiture efforts 
on december   the njbpu issued an order also consolidating outstanding issues from several other proceedings into the base rate case proceeding 
on december   ace filed a motion for reconsideration in which it suggested that these issues be dealt with in a phase ii to the base rate case to address the outstanding issues identified in the december  order 
after discussion with the parties to the base rate case  it was agreed that a phase ii to the base rate case to these issues  along with the million of deferred restructuring costs previously moved into the base rate case  would be initiated in april ace cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proceeding 
on march   dpl filed with the dpsc for an annual gas base rate increase of million  or an increase of in total operating revenue for dpl s gas business 
the filing included a request for a roe of 
dpl is currently authorized a roe of in delaware 
this is the first increase requested for dpl s gas distribution business since on may   dpl exercised its statutory right to implement an interim base rate increase of million  or of total operating revenue for dpl s gas business  subject to refund 
on october   a settlement agreement was filed with the dpsc that provides for an annual gas base revenue increase of million  with a roe  which equates to a increase in total revenues for dpl s gas business 
the settlement agreement provides that dpl is not required to refund the previously implemented int erim rate increase 
in addition  the settlement agreement provides for establishment of an environmental surcharge to recover costs associated with remediation of a coal gas site 
on december   the dpsc approved the settlement  making the interim million increase final with no refunds and implementing an additional million increase effective as of december  at the same time the dpsc approved a supplemental settlement which addresses customer service issues in the electric cost of service filing described below 
dpl filed on february  for a change in electric ancillary service rates that has an aggregate effect of increasing annual revenues by million or 
this filing was prompted by the increasing ancillary service costs charged to dpl by pjm 
the phi merger agreement  approved by the dpsc in docket no 
 provides that delmarva shall have the right to file to change in ancillary components of rates to reflect the then applicable ancillary ch arges billed to delmarva by pjm or successor organization 
on february   the dpsc accepted dpl s filing and placed the rates into effect on march   subject to refund 
dpl made this filing on february  in future years dpl will make filings to update the analysis of out of pocket environmental costs recoverable through the environmental surcharge rate 
on march  dpl submitted a cost of service study with the dpsc demonstrating it was not over earning on its electric distribution rates 
on october   the dpsc approved a settlement with respect to the march  filing confirming that no increase or decrease in dpl s electric distribution rates was necessary 
this settlement was consistent with the provisions of settlement approved by the dpsc in connection with the pepco and conectiv merger that provided for no change in dpl s distribution base rates until may  the rate settlement also establishes objectives and procedures to reduce the number of customers whose bills are estimated over or more months due to difficulties in obtaining access to the meter and to establish a reduced interest charge for customers who are paying past due bills under a payment arrangement 
the dpsc also approved a supplemental settlement on december   regarding quality of service by dpl 
in the supplemental settlement  dpl agreed to additional customer service provisions  including opening full time walk in facilities that accept payments  and standards for call center performance 
on august   dpl submitted its annual gas cost recovery gcr rate filing to the dpsc 
in its filing  dpl sought to increase its gcr rate by approximately in anticipation of increasing natural gas commodity costs 
the rate  which passes dpl s increased gas costs along to its customers  became effective november  and is subject to refund pending evidentiary hearings that will commence in april in compliance with the merger settlement approved by the mpsc in connection with the merger of pepco and conectiv  on december   dpl and pepco submitted testimony and supporting schedules to establish electricity distribution rates in maryland effective july   when the current distribution rate freeze caps end 
dpl s filing demonstrates that it is in an under earning situation and  as allowed in the merger settlement  dpl requested that a temporary rate reduction implemented on july  for non residential customers be terminated effective july  dpl estimates that the termination of the rate reduction would increase its annual revenues by approximately million 
with limited exceptions  the merger settlement does not permit dpl to file for any additional rate increase until december  pepco s filing also demonstrates that it is in an under earning situation 
however the merger settlement provides that pepco s distribution rates after july  can only remain the same or be decreased 
with limited exceptions  pepco is not entitled to file for a rate increase until december  although the outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted  dpl and pepco each believes that the likelihood that its distribution rate will be reduced as of july  is remote 
stranded cost determination and securitization on january   ace filed a petition with the njbpu seeking an administrative determination of stranded costs associated with the b 
l 
england generating station 
the net after tax stranded costs included in the petition were approximately million 
an administrative determination of the stranded costs was needed due to the cancelled sale of the plant 
on july  the njbpu rendered an oral decision approving the administrative determination of stranded costs at a level of million 
as a result of this order  ace reversed million million after tax of previously accrued liability for possible disallowance of stranded costs 
this credit to expense is classified as an extraordinary item in phi s and ace s consolidated statements of earnings because the original accrual was part of an extraordinary charge resulting from the discontinuation of sfas no 
in conjunction with the deregulation of ace s energy business in september on february   the njbpu issued an order on its own initiative seeking input from ace and the ratepayer advocate as to whether and by how much to reduce the pre tax return that ace was then authorized to earn on b 
l 
england 
ace responded on february with arguments that reduced costs to ratepayers could be achieved legally through timely approvals by the njbpu of the stranded cost filing made by ace on january  and a securitization filing made the week of february   and it would be unlawful  perhaps unconstitutional  and a breach of settlement and prior orders for the njbpu to deny a fair recovery on prudently incurred investment and to do so without evidentiary hearings or other due process 
on april   the njbpu issued an order making the return previously allowed on b 
l 
england interim  as of the date of the order  and directing that the issue of the appropriate return for b 
l 
england be included in the stranded cost proceeding 
on july   the njbpu voted to approve a pre tax return reflecting a roe for the period april  through august  the rate authorized by the njbpu from august   through such time as ace securitizes the stranded costs was  which the njbpu represented as being approximately equivalent to the securitization rate 
on september   the njbpu issued a written order memorializing its july  decision 
on february   ace filed a bondable stranded costs rate order petition with the njbpu 
the petition requested authority to issue million of transition bonds to finance the recovery of stranded costs associated with b 
l 
england and costs of issuance 
on september  the njbpu issued a bondable stranded cost rate order authorizing the issuance of up to million of transition bonds 
on december   ace funding issued million of transition bonds 
see long term debt above 
restructuring deferral pursuant to a july  summary order issued by the njbpu under edeca which was subsequently affirmed by a final decision and order issued march   ace was obligated to provide basic generation service from august  to at least july  to retail electricity customers in ace s service territory who did not choose a competitive energy supplier 
the order allowed ace to recover through customer rates certain costs incurred in providing bgs 
ace s obligation to provide bgs was subsequently extended to july  at the allowed rates  for the period august  through july   ace s aggregate allowed costs exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying bgs 
these under recovered costs were partially offset by a million deferred energy cost liability existing as of july  leac liability that was related to ace s levelized energy adjustment clause and ace s demand side management programs 
ace established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance 
on august   ace filed a petition with the njbpu for the recovery of approximately million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of bgs and other restructuring related costs incurred by ace over the four year period august  through july  the deferred balance is net of the offset for the leac liability 
the petition also requests that ace s rates be reset as of august  so that there will be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date 
the increase sought represents an overall annual increase in electric rates and is in addition to the base rate increase discussed above 
ace s recovery of the deferred costs is subject to review and approval by the njbpu in accordance with edeca 
on july   the njbpu issued a summary order permitting ace to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and to reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of edeca 
the summary order approved the recovery of million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning august  the summary order also transferred to ace s pending base rate case for further consideration approximately million of the deferred balance 
the njbpu estimated the overall deferral balance as of july  at million  of which million was disallowed recovery by ace 
since the amounts included in this decision are based on estimates through july   the actual ending deferred cost balance will be subject to review and finalization by the njpbu and ace 
the approved rates became effective on august  based on an analysis of the summary order and in accordance with prevailing accounting rules  ace recorded a charge of million million after tax during the second quarter of this charge is in addition to amounts previously accrued for disallowance 
ace believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the njbpu 
ace is awaiting the final written order from the njbpu and is evaluating its options related to this decision 
the njbpu s action is not appealable until a final written order has been issued 
pepco regulatory matters divestiture cases final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on july  following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers  on an approximately basis  the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
as of december   the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were  respectively  approximately million and 
million  respectively 
other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the normalization rules 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately of the generation related aditc balance  would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to dc customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
it is uncertain when the dcpsc will issue a decision 
pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that was raised in the dc case 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
on november   the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on mary land allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit  ie  million  and the generation related aditc 
if such sharing were to violate the normalization rules  pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately of the generation related aditc balance  would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance  as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the maryland retail jurisdictional t ransmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
under maryland law  if the proposed order is appealed to the mpsc  the proposed order is not a final  binding order of the mpsc and further action by the mpsc is required with respect to this matter 
pepco has appealed the hearing examiner s decision on the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs to the mpsc 
pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided 
pepco believes that its calculation of the maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately of the edit and aditc balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
standard offer service sos district of columbia on february   the dcpsc opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to a the establishment of terms and conditions for providing sos in the district of columbia after pepco s obligation to provide sos terminates on february   and b the selecting of a new sos provider 
under current district of columbia law  if the dcpsc selects a retail sos provider ie  some entity or entities other than pepco to provide sos after february   it must make the selection s before july   however  if the dcpsc decides to have pepco continue as the sos provider after february   it need not complete the procurement process before july  the law also allows the selection of pepco as the sos provider in the event of insufficient or inadequate bids from potential sos providers other than pepco 
on december   the dcpsc issued an order which sets forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new sos provider s and the provision of sos by pepco on a contingency basis 
on december   the dcpsc also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if pepco continues as the sos provider after february  on january   the dcpsc issued an order in which it requested initial and reply comments by january   and february   respectively  on which sos model ie  the wholesale sos model  under which pepco would continue as the sos provider after february   or the retail model  under which some entity or entities other than pepco would be the sos provider after february  would best meet the needs of the dc sos customers after february  pepco and most of the other parties in the case filed applications for reconsideration and or clarification of various parts of the two dcpsc orders that set forth the terms and conditions that would apply under the retail and wholesale sos models 
pepco and most parties also filed initial and reply comments on which sos model would best serve the needs of the sos customers in dc

virginia on december   dpl and conectiv energy filed with the vscc an amendment to extend the power supply agreement for one year  ie  through december   and on a month to month basis thereafter  as it applies to power supply for dpl s virginia polr customers 
the vscc approved the amendment in an order issued on march  after december  either dpl or conectiv energy can terminate conectiv energy s obligation to provide supplies to meet dpl s virginia polr obligations by giving days written notice to the other party 
critical accounting policies general the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
accounting policy choices pepco holdings management believes that based on the nature of the businesses that its subsidiaries operate  pepco holdings has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes 
for instance  the most significant portion of pepco holdings business consists of its regulated utility operations  which are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 

sfas no 
allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates 
however  in the areas that pepco holdings is afforded accounting policy choices  management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial condition or resu lts of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of significant estimates used by pepco holdings include the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in goodwill and asset impairment evaluations  fair value calculations based on estimating market pricing associated with derivative instruments  pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions  unbilled revenue calculations  and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets 
although pepco holdings believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
goodwill impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain  actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 require the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas no 
indicates that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill  an impairment charge may be necessary 
in order to estimate fair value pepco holdings may discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment  or employ other valuation techniques 
substantially all of pepco holdings goodwill was generated in the merger transaction between pepco and conectiv during and was allocated to pepco holdings rate regulated entities 
during pepco holdings tested its goodwill for impairment as of july  this testing c oncluded that pepco holdings goodwill balance was not impaired 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long term asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill  discussed above 
for a discussion of the impairment t esting results related to conectiv energy s combustion turbines  refer to part ii  item  note conectiv energy events  herein 
investment impairment evaluation pepco holdings is required to evaluate its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb no 
 the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under apb no 
is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered to be other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments under apb no 
involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with sfas no 
however  additional judgment is required by management in order to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary 
during early  pepco holdings announced plans to sell its percent interest in starpower as part of an ongoing effort to redirect pepco holdings investments and to focus on its energy related businesses 
at december   pepco holdings had an investment in starpower of million 
however  because of the distressed telecommunications market and the changed expectations of starpower s future performance  pepco holdings has determined that the fair value of its investment in starpower at december  is million 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  pepco holdings recorded a noncash charge to its consolidated earnings of million million after tax 
derivative instruments pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and interest rate fluctuations  there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances  actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to pepco holdings assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income loss  and results of operations 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure for risk management purposes 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
ch ange in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco holdings follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
no 
 when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement 
plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date  december regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
apply to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace 
pepco holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
new accounting standards new accounting policies adopted sfas no 
pepco holdings adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
entitled accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
on january  this statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations 
based on the implementation of sfas no 
 at december   million in asset removal costs million for dpl and million for pepco and million in asset removal costs at december  million for dpl and million for pepco have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
effective july  pepco holdings implemented sfas no 
entitled accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its consolidated balance sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement resulted in pepco holdings reclassification initially as of september  of its company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust which holds solely parent junior subordinated debentures toprs and mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock on its consolidated balance sheet to a long term liability classification 
additionally  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 dividends on the toprs and mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock  declared subsequent to the july  implement ation of sfas no 
 are recorded as interest expense in pepco holdings consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 prior period amounts were not reclassified on either the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of earnings 
in  potomac electric power company trust i redeemed all million of its trust originated preferred securities at par 
also during  atlantic capital i redeemed all million of its quarterly income preferred securities at par 
effective with the december  implementation of fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin  pepco holdings subsidiaries toprs were deconsolidated and therefore not included in its consolidated balance sheet at december  additionally  based on the provisions of fin pepco holdings recorded its investments in its toprs trusts and its debentures issued to the trusts on its consolidated balance sheet at december  these items were previously eliminated in consolidation 
for additional information regarding pepco holdings implementation of fin refer to the fin implementation section below 
accordingly  pepco holdings consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects only the reclassification of pepco s mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock into its long term liability section 
in december  the fasb deferred for an indefinite period the application of the guidance in sfas no 
to non controlling interests that are classified as equity in the financial statements of a subsidiary but would be classified as a liability in the parent s financial statements under sfas no 
the deferral is limited to mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
pepco holdings does not have an interest in any such applicable entities as of december   but will continue to evaluate the applicability of this deferral to entities which may be consolidated as a result of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin pepco holdings and its subsidiaries applied the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  commencing in to their agreements that contain guarantee and indemnification clauses 
these provisions expand those required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  by requiring a guarantor to recognize a liability on its balance sheet for the fair value of obligation it assumes under certain guarantees issued or modified after december  and to disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance under the guarantee is remote 
as of december   pepco holdings and its subsidiaries did not have material obligations under guarantees or indemnifications issued or modified after december   which are required to be recognized as a liability on its consolidated balance sheets 
fin in january fin was issued 
fin was revised and superseded by fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r which clarified some of the provisions of fin and exempted certain entities from its requirements 
fin r requires the application of either fin or fin r by public entities to all special purpose entities  as defined in fin r spes  created prior to february  at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  pepco holdings year end financial statements 
all entities created after january  by public entities were already required to be analyzed under fin  and they must continue to do so  unless fin r is adopted early 
fin r will be applicable to all non spes created prior to february  by public entities that are not small business issuers at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  pepco holdings first quarter ended march  financial statements 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the following entities were impacted at december  trust preferred securities dpl and ace have wholly owned financing subsidiary trusts that have common and preferred trust securities outstanding and hold junior subordinated debentures the debentures issued by dpl and ace 
dpl and ace own all of the common securities of the trusts  which constitute approximately of the liquidation amount of all of the trust securities issued by the trusts 
the trusts use interest payments received on the debentures  which are the trusts only assets  to make cash distributions on the trust securities 
the obligations of dpl and ace pursuant to the debentures and guarantees of distributions with respect to the trusts securities  to the extent the trusts have funds available therefore  constitute full and unconditional guarantees of the obligations of the trusts under the trust securities the trusts have issued 
the preferred trust securities are subject to mandatory redemption upon payment of the debentures at maturity or upon redem ption 
the debentures mature in to the debentures are subject to redemption  in whole or in part  at the option of dpl or ace  as applicable  at of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  and as a result of the deconsolidation of the trusts from phi s financial statements  dpl and ace s debentures held by the trusts and dpl and ace s investments in the trusts are included in phi s consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the previously recorded preferred trust securities have been removed from phi s consolidated balance sheets as of december  accordingly  the deconsolidation of the trusts overall does not significantly impact phi s consolidated balance sheet at december  ace funding ace formed ace funding during ace funding is a wholly owned subsidiary of ace 
ace funding was organized for the sole purpose of purchasing and owning bondable transition property  issuing transition bonds to fund the purchasing of bondable transition property  pledging its interest in bondable transition property and other collateral to the trustee for the transition bonds to collateralize the transition bonds  and to perform activities that are necessary  suitable or convenient to accomplish these purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  ace funding was assessed and it was determined that it should remain consolidated with pepco holdings and ace s financial statements as of december  accordingly  the implementation of fin did not impact pepco holdings or ace s consolidated balance sheet at december  leveraged leases pci manages a portfolio of financial investments in leveraged leases 
these leveraged lease transactions involve pci s purchase and leaseback of utility assets  located outside of the united states  that are designed to provide a long term  stable stream of cash flow and earnings 
the leases are in separate legally isolated trusts established to hold the leased assets and the majority of the financing for such transactions has been third party  non recourse debt over the base term 
in accordance with the provisions of fin  and as a result of the deconsolidation of the leveraged lease trusts from phi s financial statements  the underlying leases held by the leveraged lease trusts are excluded and phi s investments in the trusts are included in phi s consolidated balance sheet as of december  using the line item investment in finance leases held in trust 
the deconsolidation of the leveraged lease trusts did not significantly impact pepco holdings consolidated balance sheet at december  other in accordance with the provisions of fin  two small entities created after january  were required to be consolidated at december  which previously were not consolidated 
these entities are not material to pepco holdings operations and therefore their consolidation did not have a significant impact on pepco holdings overall financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  pepco holdings has analyzed its interests in entities with which it has power sale agreements and has determined those entities do not qualify as spe as defined in fin r 
the company will continue to analyze interests in investments and contractual relationships including power sale agreements to determine if such entities should be consolidated or deconsolidated in accordance with fin r 
pepco holdings is presently unable to determine the effect  if any  on its financial statements of applying fin r to these entities 
new accounting standards issued in july  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and not held for trading purposes as defined in eitf issue no 
issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
this eitf concluded that determining whether realized gains and losses on physically settled derivative contracts not held for trading purposes should be reported in the income statement on a gross or net basis is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances 
pepco holdings is in the process of completing its evaluation of the extent of its subsidiaries operating revenue and operating expense reclassifications that may be required 
pepco hold ings anticipates that the implementation of eitf  including the associated reclassification of certain operating revenues and operating expenses  will not have an impact on its overall financial position or net results of operations 
risk factors the business and operations of phi and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of phi and its subsidiaries  including  depending on the circumstances  their results of operations and financial condition 
phi and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if phi or any of its subsidiaries receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  phi s business could be negatively affected 
phi is a registered public utility holding company that is subject to regulation by the sec under puhca 
as a registered public utility holding company  phi requires sec approval to  among other things  issue securities  acquire or dispose of utility assets or securities of utility companies and acquire other businesses 
in addition  under puhca transactions among phi and its subsidiaries generally must be performed at cost and subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends out of an accumulated deficit or paid in capital without sec approval 
the utility businesses conducted by phi s power delivery subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is regulated by public service commissions in its service territories  with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity 
in addition  the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the ferc 
the companies cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operatin g its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  the financial results of that company  and correspondingly  phi  will be adversely affected 
phi s subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses 
phi believes that its subsidiaries have obtained the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for their existing operations and that their businesses are conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  phi is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require phi s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or to change the way they conduct their operations 
phi s business could be adversely affected by the mirant bankruptcy 
in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant 
as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries 
on july   mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  the mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect phi s business 
see relationship with mirant corporation 
pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations regulatory and other matters 
the operating results of phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
the businesses of phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries are seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  phi s power delivery and competitive energy subsidiaries historically have generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
the facilities of phi s subsidiaries may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease their revenues or increase their expenses 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt generation  transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if phi s operatin g subsidiaries are unable to perform their contractual obligations for any of these reasons  they may incur penalties or damages 
the transmission facilities of phi s power delivery subsidiaries are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the operations of phi s subsidiaries 
the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
the ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco  dpl and ace operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impa ct on the operations of the other utilities 
however  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl or ace 
if any of pepco  dpl or ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its and phi s business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase the expenses of phi and its subsidiaries 
the operations of phi s subsidiaries  both regulated and unregulated  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require phi s subsidiaries to make capital expenditures and to incur other expenditures to  among other things  meet emissions standards  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
phi s subsidiaries also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if phi s subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond their control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  phi s subsidiaries incur costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if phi s subsidiaries fail to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of phi s subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs 
phi s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
phi s competitive energy business is highly competitive the unregulated energy generation  supply and marketing businesses in the mid atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels 
phi s competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators  independent power producers  wholesale power marketers and brokers  and traditional utilities that continue to operate generation assets 
this competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs 
phi s competitive energy businesses rely on some transmission and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale electricity and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities 
phi s competitive energy businesses depend upon transmission facilities owned and operated by others for delivery to customers 
the operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal  natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others 
if electric transmission is disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable  the competitive energy businesses ability to sell and deliver wholesale power  and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations  could be adversely affected 
similarly  if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available the competitive energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected 
changes in technology may adversely affect phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity  including fuel cells  microturbines and photovoltaic solar cells 
it is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies  thereby making the generating facilities of phi s competitive energy businesses less competitive 
in addition  increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect phi s power delivery businesses 
phi s risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses 
the operations of phi s competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk 
however  actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations 
in particular  risks in phi s energy activities were measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of the potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movement 
these estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes 
consequently  if prices significantly deviate from historical prices  phi s risk management systems  including assumptions supporting risk limits  may not protect phi from significant losses 
in addition  adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in phi s earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules 
the commodity hedging procedures used by phi s competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices 
to lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  phi s competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations 
as part of this strategy  phi s competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  tolling agreements  futures  financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
conectiv energy s goal is to hedge of both the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities 
however  the actual level of hedging coverage may vary from these goals 
due to the high heat rate of the pepco energy services power plant generation  pepco energy services infrequently locks in the forward value of these plants with wholesale contracts 
to the extent that phi s competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their h edging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect phi s businesses 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect the operations of phi and its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force phi and its subsidiaries to increase security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets 
if any of phi s infrastructure facilities  such as its electric generation  fuel storage  transmission or distribution facilities  were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of phi and its subsidiaries to raise needed capital 
the insurance coverage of phi and its subsidiaries may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that they might incur 
phi and its subsidiaries currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
phi and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for phi s power delivery and competitive energy businesses 
phi and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect their business 
phi and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in credit ratings of phi or its subsidiaries  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect their ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
phi may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan 
phi follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan 
in accordance with these accounting standards  phi makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on phi s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on phi s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  phi could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the pension plan if phi s defined benefit plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
phi s cash flow  ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries 
phi s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries 
phi is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries  and all of phi s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  phi s cash flow  its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to phi in the form of dividends 
the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by phi or to make any funds available for such payment 
because the claims of the creditors and preferred stockholders of phi s subsidiaries are superior to phi s entitlement to dividends  the unsecured debt and obligations of phi are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of preferred stock to receive dividend payments 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render phi and its subsidiaries vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as phi and its subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law and phi s organizational documents may discourage an acquisition of phi 
phi s organizational documents and the delaware general corporation law both contain provisions that could impede the removal of phi s directors and discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire phi 
for example  phi has a staggered board of directors that is divided into three classes of equal size  with one class elected each year for a term of three years 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  phi is subject to the business combination law set forth in section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of phi

dividends under puhca  phi is prohibited  without sec approval  from paying dividends on its common stock from capital or unearned surplus 
phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries

for this purpose  the capitalization ratio is equal to i common stock capital plus surplus  divided by ii total capital including long term debt plus surplus 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl  ace and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
following the consummation of the acquisition of conectiv by pepco on august   the pepco general retirement plan and the conectiv retirement plan were merged into the retirement plan on december  the provisions and benefits of the merged retirement plan applicable to pepco employees are identical to those in the original pepco plan and the provisions and benefits applicable to dpl and ace employees are identical to those in the original conectiv plan 
as of the valuation  the retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without any additional funding 
however  phi s funding policy with regard to the retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accrued benefit obligation 
in and  phi made discretionary tax deductible cash contributions to the retirement plan in accordance with its funding policy 
in  the accumulated benefit obligation for the retirement plan increased over  primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the accumulated benefit obligation  which reflected the declining interest rate environment in however  the financial markets experienced a recovery during  and the retirement plan assets achieved returns in excess of the levels assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  in october phi contributed a total of million of which million was funded by pepco and million funded by ace to the retirement plan 
the contribution was made to ensure that under reasonable assumptions  the funding level at year end would be in excess of of the accrued benefit obligation 
in  phi contributed a total of million all of which was funded by pepco to the retirement plan 
phi currently estimates that no contributions will be required i n to maintain a funding level in excess of of the accumulated benefit obligation 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary information about pepco s consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   is as follows contractual maturity obligation total less than year years years after years dollars in millions short term debt long term debt preferred stock subject to mandatory redemption capital and operating leases total sources of capital pepco s sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
pepco s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
see risk factors for a discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
short term funding sources pepco has traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to temporarily fund long term capital requirements 
pepco maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
the commercial paper notes can be issued with maturities up to days from the date of issue 
in july  pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace entered into i a three year working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of million and ii a day working capital credit facility with an aggregate credit limit of million 
pepco holdings credit limit under these facilities is million  and the credit limit of each of pepco  dpl and ace under these facilities is the lower of million and the maximum amount of short term debt authorized by the appropriate state commission  except that the aggregate amount of credit utilized by pepco  dpl and ace at any given time under these facilities may not exceed million 
funds borrowed under these facilities are available for general corporate purposes 
either credit facility also can be used as credit support for the commercial paper programs of the respective companies 
the three year and day credit agreements contain customary financial and other cove nants that  if not satisfied  could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements or restrict the ability of the companies to borrow under the agreements 
among these covenants is the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of or less  computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreements 
as of december   the applicable ratios for pepco holdings  pepco  dpl and ace were 
 and  respectively 
the credit agreements also contain a number of customary events of default that could result in the acceleration of repayment obligations under the agreements  including i the failure of any borrowing company or any of its significant subsidiaries to pay when due  or the acceleration of  certain indebtedness under other borrowing arrangements  ii certain bankruptcy events  judgments or decrees against any borrowing company or its significant subsidiaries  and iii a change in control as defined in the credit agreements of pepco holdings or the failure of pepco holdings to own all of the voting stock of pepco  dpl and ace 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for pepco are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to refund or refinance existing securities 
puhca restrictions an sec financing order dated july  the financing order  requires that  in order to issue debt or equity securities  including commercial paper  pepco must maintain a ratio of common stock equity to total capitalization consisting of common stock  preferred stock  if any  long term debt and short term debt of at least percent 
at december   pepco s common equity ratio was percent 
the financing order also requires that all rated securities issued by pepco be rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized rating agency 
accordingly  if pepco s common equity ratio were less than percent or if no nationally recognized rating agency rated a security investment grade  pepco could not issue the security without first obtaining from the sec an amendment to the financing order 
if an amendment to the financing order is required to enable pepco to effect a financing  there is no certainty that such an amendment could be obtained  as to the terms and conditions on which an amendment could be obtained or as to the timing of sec action 
the failure to obtain timely relief from the sec  in such circumstances  could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of pepco 
other liquidity considerations for a discussion of the potential impact of the mirant bankruptcy on liquidity  see relationship with mirant corporation section that follows 
regulatory and other matters relationship with mirant corporation in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant corporation  formerly southern energy  inc as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries collectively  mirant 
on july   mirant corporation and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas the bankruptcy court 
under bankruptcy law  a debtor generally may  with authorization from a bankruptcy court  assume or reject executory contracts 
a rejection of an executory contract entitles the counterparty to file a claim as an unsecured creditor against the bankruptcy estate for damages incurred due to the rejection of the contract 
in a bankruptcy proceeding  a debtor can normally restructure some or all of its pre petition liabilities 
depending on the outcome of the matters discussed below  the mirant bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of pepco 
however  management currently believes that pepco currently have sufficient cash  cash flow and borrowing capacity under their credit facilities and in the capital markets to be able to satisfy the additional cash requirements that are expected to arise due to the mirant bankruptcy 
accordingly  management does not anticipate that the mirant bankruptcy will impair the ability of pepco to fulfill their contractual obligations or to fund projected capital expenditures 
on this basis  management currently does not believe that the mirant bankruptcy will have a material adverse effect on pepco s financial condition 
transition power agreements as part of the asset purchase and sale agreement for the pepco generation assets the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco and mirant entered into transition power agreements for maryland and the district of columbia  respectively collectively  the tpas 
under these agreements  mirant was obligated to supply pepco with all of the capacity and energy needed to fulfill its standard offer service obligations in maryland through june and its standard offer service obligations in the district of columbia into january  in each case at rates that were lower than the rates that pepco charges to its customers 
the original rates under the tpas were less than the prevailing market rates 
at the time mirant filed for bankruptcy  the purchase prices for energy and capacity under the tpas were below the prevailing market rates 
to avoid the potential rejection of the tpas pepco and mirant corporation and its affiliate mirant americas energy marketing  lp the mirant parties entered into a settlement agreement  which was approved by the bankruptcy court on november  the settlement agreement 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the mirant parties have assumed both of the tpas and the tpas have been amended  effective october   to increase the purchase price of energy thereunder as described below 
the settlement agreement also provides that pepco has an allowed  pre petition general unsecured claim against each of the mirant parties in the amount of million the pepco tpa claim  and has the right to assert the pepco tpa claim against other mirant debtors 
on december   pepco filed proofs of claim in the amount of million against the appropriate mirant debtors 
in accordance with the settlement agreement  the purchase price of energy under the tpas has increased from to per megawatt hour during summer months may through september and from to per megawatt hour during winter months october through april under the district of columbia tpa and has increased from to per megawatt hour during summer months and from to per megawatt hour during winter months under the maryland tpa 
under the amended tpas  the purchase prices paid by pepco for capacity in the district of columbia and maryland remain per megawatt hour and the charge paid by pepco for certain ancillary services remain 
per megawatt hour 
the amendments to the tpas have resulted in an increase in the average purchase price to pepco for energy from approximately cents per kilowatt hour under the original terms of the tpas to an average purchase price of approximatel y cents per kilowatt hour 
the revenues produced by the currently approved tariff rates that pepco charges its customers for providing standard offer service average approximately cents per kilowatt hour 
pepco estimates that  as a result of the price increases  it will pay mirant an additional million for the purchase of energy beginning october  through the remaining terms of the tpas 
these payments will be offset by a reduction of payments by pepco to customers for the period through of approximately million pursuant to the generation procurement credit established pursuant to regulatory settlements entered into in the district of columbia and maryland under which pepco and its customers share any margin between the price paid by pepco to procure standard offer service and the price paid by customers for standard offer service 
as a result  pepco currently anticipates that it will incur a net additional cash outlay of approximately million due to the amendments of the respective tpas 
the foregoing estimates are based on current service territory load served by competitive suppliers and by standard offer se rvice and does not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to fluctuation 
the amount  if any  that pepco will be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the pepco tpa claim will depend on the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate 
no receivable has been recorded in pepco s accounting records in respect of the pepco tpa claim 
any recovery would be shared with customers pursuant to the generation procurement credit 
power purchase agreements under agreements with firstenergy corp  formerly ohio edison firstenergy  and allegheny energy  inc  both entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from firstenergy megawatts of capacity and energy annually through december the firstenergy ppa 
under an agreement with panda  entered into in  pepco is obligated to purchase from panda megawatts of capacity and energy annually through the panda ppa 
in each case  the purchase price is substantially in excess of current market prices 
as a part of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco entered into a back to back arrangement with mirant 
under this arrangement  mirant is obligated  among other things  to purchase from pepco the capacity and energy that pepco is obligated to purchase under the firstenergy ppa and the panda ppa at a price equal to the price pepco is obligated to pay under the ppas the ppa related obligations 
pepco pre petition claims when mirant filed its bankruptcy petition on july   mirant had unpaid obligations to pepco of approximately million  consisting primarily of payments due to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations the mirant pre petition obligations 
the mirant pre petition obligations constitute part of the indebtedness for which mirant is seeking relief in its bankruptcy proceeding 
pepco has filed proofs of claim in the mirant bankruptcy proceeding in the amount of approximately million to recover this indebtedness  however  the amount of pepco s recovery  if any  is uncertain 
the million difference between mirant s unpaid obligation to pepco and the million proofs of claim filed by pepco primarily represents a tpa settlement adjustment which is included in the million proofs of claim filed by pepco on december  against the mirant debtors 
in view of this uncertainty  pepco  in the third quarter of  expensed million million after tax to establish a reserve against the million receivable from mirant 
the amount expensed represents pepco s estimate of the possible outcome in bankruptcy  although the amount ultimately recoverable could be higher or lower 
mirant s attempt to reject the ppa related obligations on august   mirant filed with the bankruptcy court a motion seeking authorization to reject its ppa related obligations 
mirant s motion also sought injunctions to prohibit pepco from initiating  or encouraging any person or entity to initiate  any proceedings before the ferc that seek to require mirant to perform the ppa related obligations and to prohibit ferc from taking any action to require mirant to perform the ppa related obligations 
on september   the bankruptcy court entered an order stating that it was not necessary to issue an injunction against pepco because the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code prohibit pepco from commencing or continuing any judicial or administrative proceedings against mirant 
the bankruptcy court s order did grant a preliminary injunction that prohibits ferc from i taking any action to require or coerce mirant to abide by the terms of the ppa related obligations or commencing or continuing any proceeding outside of the bankruptcy court with respect to the ppa related obligations and ii taking any action  or encouraging any person or entity to take an action  to require or coerce mirant to abide by the terms of the tpas 
the bankruptcy court also ordered mirant to continue to perform the ppa related obligations and its obligations under the tpas until relieved of those obligations by an order of an appropriate court 
upon motions filed by pepco and ferc  on october   the us district court for the northern district of texas the district court withdrew jurisdiction over both the rejection and preliminary injunction proceedings from the bankruptcy court 
on december   the district court denied mirant s motion to reject the ppa related obligations 
on january  mirant filed with the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit the circuit court a notice of appeal of the district court s december decision 
on january   the official committee of unsecured creditors of mirant corporation the creditors committee filed with the circuit court a separate notice of appeal of the december decision 
also on january   the district court entered an order dissolving all injunctive relief granted by the bankruptcy court in respect of the ppa related obligations  and mirant and the creditors committee each subsequently filed a motion with the circuit court for a stay of the dissolution order pending resolution of the appeals  as well as motions to expedite the appeals 
on january   the circuit court denied mirant s and the creditors committee s motions to expedite the appeal 
on january   the circuit court denied mirant s and the creditors committee s motions to stay the district court s order 
oral argument will be scheduled the week of may  pepco is exercising all available legal remedies and vigorously opposing mirant s continued attempts to reject the ppa related obligations in order to protect the interests of its customers and shareholders 
while pepco believes that it has substantial legal bases to oppose the attempt to reject the agreements  the outcome of mirant s efforts to reject the ppa related obligations is uncertain 
in accordance with the bankruptcy court s september order  mirant is continuing to perform the ppa related obligations pending the resolution of the ongoing proceedings 
however  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting  and is otherwise permitted to stop performing the ppa related obligations  pepco could be required to repay to mirant  for the period beginning on the effective date of the rejection which date could be prior to the date of the court s order and possibly as early as september  and ending on the date mirant is entitled to cease its purchases of energy and capacity from pepco  all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity 
pepco estimates that the amount it could be required to repay to mirant in the unlikely event september   is determined to be the effective date of rejection  as of march   is approximately million 
this repayment would entitle pepco to file a claim against the bankruptcy estate in an amount equal to the amount repaid 
mirant has also asked the bankruptcy court to require pepco to disgorge all amounts paid by mirant to pepco in respect of the ppa related obligations  less an amount equal to the price at which mirant resold the purchased energy and capacity  for the period july  the date on which mirant filed its bankruptcy petition to september   on the theory that mirant did not receive value for those payments 
pepco estimates that the amount it would be required to repay to mirant on the disgorgement theory is approximately million 
pepco believes a claim based on this theory should be entitled to administrative expense status for which complete recovery could be expected 
if pepco were required to repay any such amounts for either period  the payment would be expensed at the time the payment is made 
the following are estimates prepared by pepco of its additional exposure if mirant s motion to reject its ppa related obligations ultimately is successful 
these estimates are based in part on current market prices and forward price estimates for energy and capacity  and do not include financing costs  all of which could be subject to significant fluctuation 
the estimates assume no recovery from the mirant bankruptcy estate and no regulatory recovery  either of which would mitigate the effect of the estimated loss 
pepco does not consider it realistic to assume that there will be no such recoveries 
based on these assumptions  pepco estimates that its pre tax exposure as of march   representing the loss of the future benefit of the ppa related obligations to pepco  is as follows if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from firstenergy commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the firstenergy ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  and million in  the last year of the firstenergy ppa 
if pepco were required to purchase capacity and energy from panda commencing as of march   at the rates provided in the ppa with an average price per kilowatt hour of approximately cents  and resold the capacity and energy at market rates projected  given the characteristics of the panda ppa  to be approximately cents per kilowatt hour  pepco estimates that it would cost approximately million for the remainder of  million in  and million in and approximately million to million annually thereafter through the contract termination date 
the ability of pepco to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate in respect of the mirant pre petition obligations and damages if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected will depend on whether pepco s claims are allowed  the amount of assets available for distribution to creditors and pepco s priority relative to other creditors 
at the current stage of the bankruptcy proceeding  there is insufficient information to determine the amount  if any  that pepco might be able to recover from the mirant bankruptcy estate  whether the recovery would be in cash or another form of payment  or the timing of any recovery 
if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations and pepco s full claim is not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate  pepco may seek authority from the mpsc and the dcpsc to recover its additional costs 
pepco is committed to working with its regulatory authorities to achieve a result that is appropriate for its shareholders and customers 
under the provisions of the settlement agreements approved by the mpsc and the dcpsc in the deregulation proceedings in which pepco agreed to divest its generation assets under certain conditions  the ppas were to become assets of pepco s distribution business if they could not be sold 
pepco believes that  if mirant ultimately is successful in rejecting the ppa related obligations  these provisions would allow the stranded costs of the ppas that are not recovered from the mirant bankruptcy estate to be recovered through pepco s distribution rates 
if pepco s interpretation o f the settlement agreements is confirmed  pepco expects to be able to establish the amount of its anticipated recovery as a regulatory asset 
however  there is no assurance that pepco s interpretation of the settlement agreements would be confirmed by the respective public service commissions 
if the ppa related obligations are successfully rejected  and there is no regulatory recovery  pepco will incur a loss 
however  the accounting treatment of such a loss depends on a number of legal and regulatory factors  and is not determinable at this time 
the smeco agreement as a term of the asset purchase and sale agreement  pepco assigned to mirant a facility and capacity agreement with southern maryland electric cooperative  inc smeco under which pepco was obligated to purchase the capacity of an megawatt combustion turbine installed and owned by smeco at a former pepco generating station the smeco agreement 
the agreement contemplates a monthly payment to smeco of approximately 
million 
pepco is responsible to smeco for the performance of the smeco agreement if mirant fails to perform its obligations thereunder 
at this time  mirant continues to make post petition payments due to smeco 
regulatory matters divestiture cases final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed on july  following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers  on an approximately basis  the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
as of december   the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were  respectively  approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues in the proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the normalization rules 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately of the generation related aditc balance  would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance was approxima tely million 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to dc customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
it is uncertain when the dcpsc will issue a decision 
pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application in maryland in april reply briefs were filed in may the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that was raised in the dc case 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generation assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
on november   the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on mary land allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit  ie  million  and the generation related aditc 
if such sharing were to violate the normalization rules  pepco  in addition to sharing with customers an amount equal to approximately of the generation related aditc balance  would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s million maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance  as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
as of december   the maryland retail jurisdictional t ransmission and distribution related aditc balance was approximately million 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
under maryland law  if the proposed order is appealed to the mpsc  the proposed order is not a final  binding order of the mpsc and further action by the mpsc is required with respect to this matter 
pepco has appealed the hearing examiner s decision on the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs to the mpsc 
pepco cannot predict what the outcome of the appeal will be or when the appeal might be decided 
pepco believes that its calculation of the maryland customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately of the edit and aditc balances described above and make additional gain sharing payments related to the disallowed severance payments 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse e ffect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial condition 
standard offer service sos district of columbia on february   the dcpsc opened a new proceeding to consider issues relating to a the establishment of terms and conditions for providing sos in the district of columbia after pepco s obligation to provide sos terminates on february   and b the selecting of a new sos provider 
under current district of columbia law  if the dcpsc selects a retail sos provider ie  some entity or entities other than pepco to provide sos after february   it must make the selection s before july   however  if the dcpsc decides to have pepco continue as the sos provider after february   it need not complete the procurement process before july  the law also allows the selection of pepco as the sos provider in the event of insufficient or inadequate bids from potential sos providers other than pepco 
on december   the dcpsc issued an order which sets forth the terms and conditions for the selection of a new sos provider s and the provision of sos by pepco on a contingency basis 
on december   the dcpsc also issued an order adopting terms and conditions that would apply if pepco continues as the sos provider after february  on january   the dcpsc issued an order in which it requested initial and reply comments by january   and february   respectively  on which sos model ie  the wholesale sos model  under which pepco would continue as the sos provider after february   or the retail model  under which some entity or entities other than pepco would be the sos provider after february  would best meet the needs of the dc sos customers after february  pepco and most of the other parties in the case filed applications for reconsideration and or clarification of various parts of the two dcpsc orders that set forth the terms and conditions that would apply under the retail and wholesale sos models 
pepco and most parties also filed initial and reply comments on which sos model would best serve the needs of the sos customers in dc 
in its comments  pepco supported the wholesale sos model 
on march   the dcpsc issued an order adopting the wholesale sos model  ie  pepco will continue to be the sos provider in the district of columbia after february  the dcpsc also granted in part and denied in part the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale model 
finally  the dcpsc denied as moot the applications for reconsideration and or clarification of the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the retail sos model because the dcpsc adopted the wholesale sos model 
parties have until march  to apply for reconsideration of the order adopting the wholesale model 
generally  parties have until april  to seek judicial review of the order denying reconsideration of the order that adopted the terms and conditions applicable to the retail sos model and the order granting in part and denying in part the order adopting the terms and conditions applicable to the wholesale sos model 
maryland in april  the mpsc approved a settlement to extend the provision of sos in maryland 
under the settlement  pepco will continue to provide sos supply to customers at market prices after the existing fixed sos supply rate expires in july for periods of four years for residential and small commercial customers  two years for medium sized commercial customers and one year for large commercial customers 
in accordance with the settlement  pepco will purchase the power supply required to satisfy its market rate sos supply obligation from one or more wholesale suppliers under contracts entered into pursuant to a competitive bid procedure approved by the mpsc 
the settlement provides for pepco to recover from its sos customers the costs associated with the acquisition of the sos supply as well as an average margin of per kilowatt hour 
critical accounting policies general the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations  and which require it to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates represent those estimates and assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on financial condition or operating performance 
accounting policy choices pepco s management believes that based on the nature of the business in which it operates  it has very little choice regarding the accounting policies it utilizes 
for instance  its operations are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 

sfas no 
allows regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities and to defer the income statement impact of certain costs that are expected to be recovered in future rates 
however  in the areas that pepco is afforded accounting policy choices  management does not believe that the application of different accounting policies than those that it chose would materially impact its financial condition or results of operations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as statement of position disclosure of certain significant risks and uncertainties  requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
examples of significant estimates used by pepco include the calculation of future cash flows and fair value amounts for use in asset impairment evaluations  pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions  unbilled revenue calculations  and judgment involved with assessing the probability of recovery of regulatory assets 
although pepco believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco believes that the estimates involved in its long term asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  actual results could vary from those used in pepco estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco s assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed to not be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco considers historical cash flows 
pepco uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans pepco believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other post retirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and changes in assumptions could impact pepco s expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other post retirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  pepco estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
additionally  pepco estimates that a 
change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and income statements and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and income statements 
pepco s management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
no 
 when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and post retirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the income statement 
regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
apply to pepco s business 
pepco believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco s estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco s assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
new accounting standards new accounting policies adopted sfas no 
pepco adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
entitled accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
on january  this statement establishes the accounting and reporting standards for measuring and recording asset retirement obligations 
based on the implementation of sfas no 
 million and million in asset removal costs at december  and  respectively  have been reclassified from accumulated depreciation to a regulatory liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
effective july  pepco implemented sfas no 
entitled accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its consolidated balance sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement resulted in pepco s reclassification initially as of september  of its company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust which holds solely parent junior subordinated debentures toprs and mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock on its consolidated balance sheet to a long term liability classification 
additionally  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 dividends on the toprs and mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock  declared subsequent to the july  implementation of sfas no 
 are recorded as interest expense in pepco s consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
 prior period amounts were not reclassified on either the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  potomac electric power company trust i redeemed all million of its trust originated preferred securities at par and therefore they were not included on the accompanying december  consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  pepco s consolidated balance sheet as of december  reflects only the reclassification of pepco s mandatorily redeemable serial preferred stock into its long term liability section 
fin pepco applied the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  commencing in to their agreements that contain guarantee and indemnification clauses 
these provisions expand those required by fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  by requiring a guarantor to recognize a liability on its balance sheet for the fair value of obligation it assumes under certain guarantees issued or modified after december  and to disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance under the guarantee is remote 
as of december   pepco did not have material obligations under guarantees or indemnifications issued or modified after december   which are required to be recognized as a liability on its consolidated balance sheets 
fin in january fin was issued 
fin was revised and superseded by fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r which clarified some of the provisions of fin and exempted certain entities from its requirements 
as of december   pepco did not have any entities that were impacted by the provisions of fin risk factors the business and operations of pepco are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of pepco  including  depending on the circumstances  its results of operations and financial condition 
pepco is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if pepco receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  pepco s business could be negatively affected 
pepco s utility business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations 
pepco s operations are regulated in maryland by the mpsc and in washington  dc by the dcpsc with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity 
in addition  the rates that pepco can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the ferc 
pepco cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit pepco to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  pepco s profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by pepco in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  pepco s financial results will be adversely affected 
pepco also is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business 
pepco believes that it has obtained the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  pepco is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require pepco to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations 
pepco s business could be adversely affected by the mirant bankruptcy 
in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generation assets to mirant 
as part of the sale  pepco entered into several ongoing contractual arrangements with mirant and certain of its subsidiaries 
on july   mirant and most of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  the mirant bankruptcy could adversely affect on pepco s business 
see relationship with mirant corporation 
pepco could be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition an d results of operations regulatory and other matters 
the operating results of pepco fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
pepco s electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  pepco historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
pepco s facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if pepco is unable to perform its contractual obligat ions for any of these reasons  it may incur penalties or damages 
pepco s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on pepco s operations 
the transmission facilities of pepco are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
the ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
pepco is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
ho wever  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco 
if pepco were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase pepco s expenses 
pepco s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require pepco to incur expenses to  among other things  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
pepco also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if pepco fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  pepco incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if pepco fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on pepco s operations or require it to incur significant additional costs 
pepco s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
changes in technology may adversely affect pepco s electricity delivery businesses 
increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect pepco s business 
in addition  changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect pepco s business 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect pepco s business 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect pepco s operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force pepco to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets 
if any of pepco s transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of pepco to raise needed capital 
pepco s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur 
pepco currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
pepco may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for pepco 
pepco is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect its business 
pepco relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in pepco s credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
pepco may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to the retirement plan 
pepco follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan in which pepco s employees participate 
in accordance with these accounting standards  pepco makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on pepco s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on pepco s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  pepco could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the retirement plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render pepco vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as pepco in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
because pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations 
all of the members of pepco s board of directors  as well as many of pepco s executive officers  are officers of phi 
among other decisions  pepco s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  including limitations imposed by puhca  and subject to the financial covenants under pepco s outstanding debt instruments  pepco s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on pepco s earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations delmarva power light company results of operations the results of operations discussion for dpl is presented only for the year ended december  in accordance with general instruction i a 
all amounts in the tables below are in millions 
electric revenues change regulated electric revenues non regulated electric revenues total electric revenues the table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation regulated and that are not subject to price regulation non regulated 
regulated electric revenues include revenues for delivery transmission and distribution service and electricity supply service within the service areas of dpl 
regulated electric revenues the increase in regulated electric revenues was primarily due to the following i a million increase from higher sales in residential and commercial sales offset by lower industrial sales  ii a million increase from higher sales to delaware municipal electric corporation  iii a million decrease in weather related sales  iv a million decrease due to lower rates for residential space heating  v a million decrease in interchange sales  and vi an million decrease in sales due to more use of alternative suppliers by customers 
customers who have chosen alternate suppliers accounted for of billed sales for the period compared to for the period 
gas revenues change regulated gas revenues non regulated gas revenues total gas revenues dpl has gas revenues from natural gas sales to retail customers connected to dpl s gas distribution facilities  which generally are subject to price regulation  and from the transportation of natural gas for customers 
the table above shows the amounts of gas revenues from sources that were subject to price regulation regulated and that were not subject to price regulation non regulated 
the increase in regulated gas revenues primarily resulted from higher revenues of million from colder winter weather in  and a million increase in residential space heating sales 
the increases were partially offset by rate decreases of million primarily resulting from gas cost rate decreases effective november and  and other variances totaling a million decrease 
heating degree days increased by for the twelve months ended december  the increase in non regulated gas revenues is primarily due to an increase in sales to large industrial customers 
operating expenses electric fuel and purchased energy electric fuel and purchased energy increased by million to million for  from million for the increase was due to increased polr and sos sales during gas purchased gas purchased increased by million to million for  from million for the over all increase was due to increased costs of natural gas for the regulated gas delivery business 
merger related costs dpl s operating results for included costs related to the conectiv pepco merger of million million after income taxes 
the million of costs included the following i million for severances and stock options settled in cash  and ii million for contributions to certain funds based on the terms of orders issued by the mpsc and dpsc 
based on the terms of the settlement agreements and commission orders in the states having regulatory jurisdiction over dpl  none of the costs related to the conectiv pepco merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases 
such costs are  and will be  excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings 
other operation and maintenance other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by million to million for  from million for the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in estimated uncollectible accounts receivable which resulted in lower bad debt expense of approximately million and a million decrease in rent expense due to lower building and property rents 
the decreases were partially offset by incremental storm costs of million incurred due to hurricane isabel 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by million to million for  from million for the decrease was primarily due a million reduction in the amortization of recoverable stranded costs partially offset by an increase of million in depreciation of plant in service 
other income expenses other expenses decreased by million to a net expense of million for  from a net expense of million for primarily due to the following i million decrease in interest charges can be attributed to the reduction in long term debt from prior year  ii a million decrease in money pool interest income  and iii a million increase in interest expense due to distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities that in accordance with sfas no 
were reclassified to interest expense 
income taxes dpl s effective tax rate in and was and  respectively  as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
in both years  the major reason for this difference is state income taxes net of federal benefit 
risk factors the business and operations of dpl are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of dpl  including  depending on the circumstances  its results of operations and financial condition 
dpl is a public utility that is subject to substantial governmental regulation 
if dpl receives unfavorable regulatory treatment  dpl s business could be negatively affected 
dpl s utility business is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects its operations 
dpl s operations are regulated in maryland by the mpsc  in delaware by the dpsc and in virginia by the vscc with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the delivery of electricity and gas 
in addition  the rates that dpl can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by the ferc 
dpl cannot change delivery or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved delivery and transmission rates are intended to permit dpl to recover its costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  dpl s profitability is affected by the rates it is able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by dpl in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approv ed rates  dpl s financial results will be adversely affected 
dpl also is required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate its business 
dpl believes that it has obtained the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  dpl is unable to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require dpl to incur additional expenses or to change the way it conducts its operations 
the operating results of dpl fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
dpl s electric utility business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally greater in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and gas is generally greater in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  dpl historically has generated less revenues and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer 
dpl s facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease its revenues or increase its expenses 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance 
furthermore  if dpl is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons  it may incur penalties or damages 
dpl s transmission facilities are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on the dpl s operations 
the electricity transmission facilities of dpl are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and as such are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
the ferc has designated a number of regional transmission operators to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
dpl is a member of pjm  which is the regional transmission operator that coordinates the movement of electricity in all or parts of delaware  maryland  new jersey  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
dpl operates its transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm and the other regional transmission operators have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
how ever  the systems put in place by pjm and the other regional transmission operators may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of dpl 
if dpl were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on its business 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws is significant and new environmental laws may increase dpl s expenses 
dpl s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations  relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations require dpl to incur expenses to  among other things  conduct site remediation and obtain permits 
dpl also may be required to pay significant remediation costs with respect to third party sites 
if dpl fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  dpl incurs costs to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval or if dpl fails to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on dpl s operations or require it to incur significant additional costs 
dpl s current compliance strategy may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
changes in technology may adversely affect dpl s electricity and gas delivery businesses 
increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas supply and distribution  which could adversely affect dpl s business 
in addition  changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect dpl s business 
acts of terrorism could adversely affect dpl s business 
the threat of or actual acts of terrorism may affect dpl s operations in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force dpl to increase security measures and cause disruptions of power markets 
if any of dpl s transmission or distribution facilities were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  its operations could be adversely affected 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could affect the ability of dpl to raise needed capital 
dpl s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that it might incur 
dpl currently has insurance coverage for its facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that it considers appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
dpl may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for dpl 
dpl is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect its business 
dpl relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy its capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from its operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in dpl s credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect its ability to access one or more financial markets 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
dpl may be required to  or may elect to  make significant cash contributions to the retirement plan 
dpl follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under the retirement plan  a non contributory defined benefit plan in which dpl s employees participate 
in accordance with these accounting standards  dpl makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affects the calculation of projected benefit obligations  accumulated benefit obligation  reported pension liability on dpl s balance sheet  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on dpl s income statement 
furthermore  as a result of actual pension plan experience being different from expected  the accumulated benefit obligation abo could be greater than the fair value of pension plan assets 
if this were to occur  dpl could be required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas no 
the liability would be recorded as a reduction to common equity through a charge to other comprehensive income oci  and would not affect net income for the year 
the charge to oci would be restored through common equity in future periods when the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation 
phi s funding policy is to make cash contributions to the pension plan sufficient for plan assets to exceed the abo  and avoid the recognition of an additional minimum liability 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements for the retirement plan if it did not meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render dpl vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during recent natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as dpl in a favorable light and may cause them to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
because dpl is an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over its dividend policy and business and operations 
all of the members of dpl s board of directors  as well as many of dpl s executive officers  are officers of phi 
among other decisions  dpl s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  including limitations imposed by puhca  and subject to the financial covenants under dpl s outstanding debt instruments  dpl s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on dpl s earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations atlantic city electric company results of operations the results of operations discussion for ace is presented only for the year ended december  in accordance with general instruction i a 
all amounts in the table below are in millions 
electric revenues change regulated electric revenues non regulated electric revenues total electric revenues the table above shows the amounts of electric revenues earned that are subject to price regulation regulated and that are not subject to price regulation non regulated 
regulated electric revenues include revenues for delivery transmission and distribution service and electricity supply service within the service areas of ace 
regulated electric revenues the increase in regulated electric revenues was due to the following i regulated electric retail revenues increased million 
the million increase was attributed to i million increase from residential and small commercial business growth  ii million increase from august rate increase  iii a million decrease from more customers choosing alternative suppliers  iv million decrease in weather related sales  and v a million increase from other sales and rate variances 
customers who have chosen alternate suppliers accounted for of billed sales for the period compared to for the corresponding period 
interchange sales increased million due to the new jersey njbpu mandate that each new jersey utility participate in an auction to allow third party energy suppliers to provide basic generation service to the customers in its territory 
as of august   approximately of the customer megawatts per hour load  which ace was serving  began to be served by other suppliers 
this means that ace now has generation to sell to pjm  which was previously used by supply customers in the territory 
as of december   of the ace customer bgs megawatts per hour load is being supplied by other suppliers through the auction process  so now all ace generation is sold to pjm 
operating expenses electric fuel and purchased energy electric fuel and purchased energy increased by million to million for  from million for there was a million increase due to colder winter weather  higher prices and increased interchange sales partially offset by a decrease of million in purchased capacity 
in august  due to the njbpu required auction sale of bgs load  ace began supplying of its bgs energy requirements 
with the drop in energy supply  there was a corresponding drop in capacity obligations under pjm formulas 
merger related costs ace s operating results for include costs related to the conectiv pepco merger of million million after income taxes 
the million of costs included the following i a million write down of deferred electric service costs based on the terms of the decision and order issued by the njbpu on july  that required ace to forgo recovery of such costs effective upon the conectiv pepco merger  ii million for severances and stock options settled in cash  and iii million for a contribution to a certain fund based on the terms of an order issued by the njbpu 
based on the terms of the settlement agreements and commission orders in the states having regulatory jurisdiction over ace  none of the costs related to the conectiv pepco merger are recoverable in future customer rate increases 
such costs are  and will be  excluded from studies submitted in base rate filings 
other operation and maintenance other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by million to million for  from million for the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in estimated uncollectible accounts which resulted in a million decrease in bad debt expense  a million decrease in general expenses and a million decrease resulting from a severance accrual reversal made for deepwater 
the decreases were partially offset by incremental storm restoration costs of million incurred due to hurricane isabel 
impairment losses the impairment loss of million in represents the write down of the deepwater power plant due to impairment of value based on the results of a competitive bidding process 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million for  from million for primarily due to the following i million for amortization of bondable transition property as result of transition bonds issued in december  and ii million for amortization of a regulatory tax asset related to new jersey stranded costs 
deferred electric service costs deferred electric service costs decreased by million due to lower costs related to ace providing basic generation service and due to the million charge described below 
the balance for ace s deferred electric service costs was million as of december  on july   the njbpu issued its summary order permitting ace to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs that were incurred as a result of edeca and to reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of edeca 
the summary order approved the recovery of million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning august  the summary order also transferred to ace s pending base case for further consideration approximately million of the deferred balance 
the summary order estimated the overall deferral balance as of july  at million  of which million was disallowed recovery by ace 
since the amounts included in this decision are based on estimates through july   the actual ending deferred cost balance will be subject to review and finalization by the njpbu and ace 
the approved rates became effective on august  based on analysis of the order and in accordance with prevailing accounting rules  ace recorded a charge of million million after tax during the second quarter of this charge is in addition to amounts previously accrued for disallowance 
ace believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the njbpu 
ace is awaiting the final written order from the njbpu and is evaluating its options related to this decision 
the njbpu s action is not appealable until a f inal written order has been issued 
other income expenses other expenses increased by million to a net expense of million for  from a net expense of million for this increase is primarily due to higher interest expense of million due to increased amounts of outstanding long term debt  a million decrease in billings to customers to recover ace s income tax expense on contributions in aid of construction  a million decrease in interest income accrued in on deferred electric service costs and a million increase in interest expense due to distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities that in accordance with sfas no 
were reclassified to interest expense 
income taxes ace s effective tax rate in was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the major reason for this difference is state income taxes net of federal benefit 
in  the effective rate was as compared to the federal statutory rate of 
the major reasons for this difference are state income taxes net of federal benefit partially offset by the flow through deferred investment tax credits and other book tax differences 
extraordinary item on july   the njbpu approved the determination of stranded costs related to ace s january  petition relating to its bl england generating facility 
the njbpu approved recovery of million 
as a result of the order  ace reversed million of accruals in june for the possible disallowances related to these stranded costs

schedule of credit risk exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts dollars in millions december  rating exposure before credit collateral credit collateral net exposure number of counterparties greater than net exposure of counterparties greater than investment grade non investment grade split rating no external ratings internal rated investment grade internal rated non investment grade total credit reserves investment grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s or moody s rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
if it has a split rating ie  rating not uniform between major rating agencies  it is presented separately 
exposure before credit collateral includes the mtm energy contract net assets for open unrealized transactions  the net receivable payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to mtm 
amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place 
thus  this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting  but before considering collateral held 
credit collateral the face amount of cash deposits  letters of credit and performance bonds received from counterparties  not adjusted for probability of default  and if applicable property interests including oil and gas reserves 
using a percentage of the total exposure note pepco holdings attempts to minimize credit risk exposure from its competitive wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessments of counterparty creditworthiness that result in the establishment of an internal credit quality score with a corresponding credit limit  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and has established reserves for credit losses 
table this table provides point in time information on the amount of estimated production and fuel requirements hedged for the competitive energy segment s merchant generation facilities based on economic availability projections 
merchant plant owned assets hedging information estimated three calendar years estimated plant output hedged estimated plant gas requirements hedges pepco holdings portfolio of electric generating plants includes mid merit assets and peaking assets 
mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis 
these plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher 
the above information represents a hedge position for a single point in time and does not reflect the ongoing transactions executed to carry a balanced position 
pepco holdings dynamically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the projected levels of output and fuel needs change 
the percentages above are based on modeled volumetric requirements using data available at december  hedged output is for on peak periods only 
while on peak generation is economically hedged  pepco holdings has polr load requirements that are forecasted to exceed  on average  the dispatch level of generation in the fleet 
in total  pepco holdings has installed capacity that exceeds the level of polr 
the peaking units are generally not used to meet polr load requirements 
natural gas is the primary fuel for the majority of the mid merit fleet 
fuel oil is the primary fuel for the majority of the peaking units 
table value at risk associated with energy contracts for the year ended december  dollars in millions pepco holdings uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its electricity  gas  coal  and petroleum product commodity activities 
the model includes physical forward contracts used for hedging and trading  and commodity derivative instruments 
var represents a confidence interval of the probability of experiencing a mark to market loss of no more than the indicated amount on instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period 
pepco holdings estimates var across its power  gas  coal  and petroleum products commodity business using a delta gamma variance covariance model with a percent  one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
this table provides the var for all propriety trading positions of the competitive energy segment 
var represents the potential gain or loss on energy contracts and or portfolios due to changes in market prices  for a specified time period and confidence level 
proprietary trading var var for energy derivative contracts confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low notes includes all derivative contracts held for trading and marked to market under sfas no 
includes all derivative contracts under sfas no 
 including trading positions and cash flow hedges 
as var calculations are shown in a standard delta or delta gamma closed form day holding period tail normal distribution form  traditional statistical and financial methods can be employed to reconcile prior k and q vars to the above approach 
in this case  day vars divided by the square root of equal day vars  and tail vars divided by times equal tail vars 
note that these methods of conversion are not valid for converting from day or less holding periods to over month holding periods and should not be applied to non standard closed form var calculations in any case 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures pepco holdings market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
certain of pepco holdings financial instruments are exposed to market risk in the form of interest rate risk  equity price risk  commodity risk  and credit and nonperformance risk 
pepco holdings management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks

the effect of a hypothetical change in interest rates on the annual interest costs for short term and variable rate debt was approximately million as of december  equity price risk phi through its subsidiaries holds investments in marketable equity securities and venture capital funds  which invest in securities of technology and service companies related to energy  utility  and communication industries and invests in marketable securities  which consist primarily of preferred stocks with mandatory redemption features and investment grade commercial paper 
pepco holdings is exposed to equity price risk through the investments in the marketable equity securities and the venture capital funds 
the potential change in the fair value of these investments resulting from a hypothetical decrease in quoted securities prices was approximately million as of december  due to the nature of these investments and market conditions  the fair value of these investments may change by substantially more than 
commodity price risk pepco holdings is at risk for a decrease in market liquidity to levels that affect its capability to execute its commodity participation strategies 
phi believes the commodity markets to be sufficiently liquid to support its market participation 
conectiv s participation in wholesale energy markets includes marketing  trading  and arbitrage activities  which expose conectiv to commodity market risk 
to the extent conectiv has net open positions  controls are in place that are intended to keep risk exposures within management approved risk tolerance levels 
conectiv engages in commodity hedging activities to minimize the risk of market fluctuations associated with the purchase and sale of energy commodities natural gas  petroleum  coal and electricity 
the majority of these hedges relate to the procurement of fuel for its power plants  fixing the cash flows from the plant output  and securing power for electric load service 
conectiv s hedging activities are conducted using derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  which are designed to reduce the volatility on future cash flows 
conectiv s energy commodity hedging objectives  in accordance with its risk management policy  are primarily the assurance of stable and known cash flows and the fixing of favorable prices and margins when they become available 
conectiv manages to the objective of hedging the variability in future cash flows for forecasted energy output from its generation assets at or greater of such forecasted output over a period of months 
as of december  conectiv s average forecasted hedge position for the forward months was projected to meet that objective 
credit and nonperformance risk certain of phi s subsidiaries agreements may be subject to credit losses and nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  phi anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the agreements 
phi s subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness that results in the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and has established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and with non investment grade counterparties
