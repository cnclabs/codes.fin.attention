item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes related thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and management estimates the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab provides guidance in applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states to revenue recognition issues  and specifically addresses revenue recognition for up front  nonrefundable fees received in connection with research collaboration arrangements 
in accordance with sab  revenues from up front fees from our collaborators are deferred and recorded over the term that we provide ongoing services 
similarly  research support payments are recorded as revenue as we perform the research under the related agreements 
we record grant revenues as we incur expenses related to the grant projects 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research grants are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from our collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievement was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a comparable level to that before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board reached consensus on issue eitf issue addresses the accounting for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  we will apply the principles of issue to multiple element agreements that we may enter into after july  the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not

results of operations general in october  the company entered into a research collaboration and an exclusive license agreement with les laboratoires servier servier 
the agreement will allow servier to develop and commercialize the company s ampakine technology for the treatment of declines in cognitive performance associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases 
the indications covered include  but are not limited to  alzheimer s disease  mild cognitive impairment  sexual dysfunction  and the dementia associated with multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
the agreement with servier  as amended in december  includes a nonrefundable up front fee of  and research support payments of  per year through early december subject to cortex providing agreed upon levels of research personnel 
the amount of research support is subject to annual adjustment based upon the increase in the us department of labor s consumer price index 
currently  cortex receives research support of approximately  per year 
the agreement also includes potential milestone payments  plus royalty payments on sales in licensed territories 
in october  servier agreed to provide cortex with  of additional research support  in exchange for rights to our ampakine compounds for the potential treatment of anxiety disorders  in servier s licensed territories 
the  will be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period  beginning in october in january  the company entered into a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement with nv organon organon  a pharmaceutical business unit of akzo nobel 
the agreement will allow organon to develop and commercialize the company s proprietary ampakine technology for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression 
in connection with the agreement  the company received a  up front licensing payment and research support payments of approximately  per year for two years 
the agreement with organon also includes milestone payments based upon clinical development  plus royalty payments on worldwide sales 
cortex achieved its first milestone under the agreement in may  when organon selected a candidate compound to pursue in phase i clinical testing as a treatment for schizophrenia 
achieving this milestone triggered a  payment from organon  which cortex recorded as revenue upon achievement 
cortex achieved its second milestone under the agreement in september  when organon elected to continue development of the selected compound in phase ii clinical testing 
achieving the second milestone triggered another  payment from organon  with the related revenue recorded upon achievement of the milestone 
in december  organon paid cortex an additional  in order to retain its rights to the ampakine technology in the field of depression 
cortex recorded the revenue related to this milestone upon its achievement 
from inception february  through june   the company sustained losses aggregating  due to projected fluctuations in funding  continuing losses are likely over the next several years  as the company s ongoing operating expenses will only be offset  if at all  by research support payments and possible milestone payments from its research collaborations with servier and organon  or 
table of contents under planned strategic alliances that the company is seeking with other pharmaceutical companies for the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of its products 
the nature and timing of payments to cortex under the servier and organon agreements or other planned strategic alliances  if and when entered into  are likely to significantly affect the company s operations and financing activities and to produce substantial period to period fluctuations in reported financial results 
over the longer term  the company will require successful commercial development of its products by servier  organon  or its other prospective partners to attain sustained profitable operations from royalties or other product based revenues 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on its ongoing operations to date 
fiscal years ended june  and for the year ended june   the company s net loss of  compared to a net loss of  for the prior year  with the increase primarily attributable to non cash charges of  recorded for warrants issued in the company s private placements of its common stock  as discussed more fully below 
revenues for the year ended june  increased from  to  or by compared to the prior year  primarily due to a  milestone payment received from organon 
the related agreement required this payment in order for organon to retain its rights to the company s ampakine technology in the field of depression 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  increased from  to  or by compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase mostly resulted from charges incurred to develop the second generation ampakine compound  cx  which entered phase i human clinical trials in may the increase for the current year also reflected increased personnel related expenses  including recruiting fees to expand the company s clinical staff 
additionally  increased research and development expenses included technology access payments related to the organon milestone 
cortex licenses the ampakine technology from the university of california 
under the related agreement  cortex is required to remit a portion of certain remuneration received in connection with sublicensing agreements 
in late december  when cortex achieved its milestone under its agreement with organon  a technology access payment to the university of california became due and was paid by the company shortly thereafter 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  decreased from  to  or by compared to the corresponding prior year period 
the decrease resulted from reduced salary related expenses due to severance costs in the prior year period to the company s former president and chief executive officer 
increased non cash stock compensation charges primarily included the estimated fair value for the vesting of warrants issued earlier with a professional services agreement 
other expenses for the year ended june  represent non cash charges for the change in the estimated value of warrants issued in connection with the private equity financing in august  as explained more fully in note to the financial statements 
net interest income for the year ended june  increased from  to  or by compared to the prior year  due to the cash available for investing from the company s two private placements during the year

in exchange for those rights  cortex will receive  of research funding from servier  paid as  per quarter over a two year period 
with the amendment to the agreement  cortex extended the period that it amortizes revenues from servier s earlier up front fee 
under the original october agreement  cortex received a  licensing fee from servier  which cortex was recording as revenue over that agreement s three year collaborative research phase 
after amending the agreement in october  cortex began amortizing the remaining unearned licensing revenues over the two year period of the extended research support 
compared to the prior year  licensing revenues for the year ended june  decreased by approximately  as a result of this change 
revenues for fiscal year included a  milestone payment from the agreement with organon  the company s other collaborative partner 
organon triggered this milestone in september when it elected to continue its development of an ampakine compound by entering phase ii studies for schizophrenia 
cortex recorded the revenue from this milestone upon achievement as the company has no ongoing obligations under the related agreement 
research and development expenses for the year ended june  decreased to  or by compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from charges incurred in the prior year for the phase ii clinical study in mci being conducted with servier 
in connection with the mci study  in january the company sponsored a meeting of the clinical investigators participating in the trial 
nearly all other costs for this study were borne by servier 
the decrease for the current year also reflected decreased personnel related expenses of  from comparatively lower staffing levels and a resultant decrease of  in spending for animals and laboratory supplies 
in addition  prior year research and development expenses included technology access payments related to the organon milestone

beginning in october  
table of contents servier has agreed to provide an additional  of research support to cortex  to be paid in quarterly installments of  over a two year period 
the agreement also includes milestone payments based upon successful clinical development and royalties on sales in licensed territories 
research and licensing payments received in connection with the agreement with organon totaled  through june  of this amount  cortex received  during the year ended june   representing the third milestone from organon 
the related agreement required the milestone payment in order for organon to retain its rights to the company s ampakine technology in the field of depression 
under the terms of the agreement  cortex may receive additional milestone payments based on clinical development of the licensed technology and ultimately  royalties on worldwide sales 
in august  the company completed a private placement to accredited investors of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at per share and five year warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the company received approximately  in net proceeds from the private placement 
the warrants are subject to a call right in favor of the company to the extent that the closing price of the company s common stock exceeds per share for any thirteen consecutive trading day period following december  in january  the company received proceeds of approximately  from the exercise of warrants issued in connection with this private placement

in january  the company completed a private placement of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock at per share and five year warrants to purchase up to an additional aggregate of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the company received approximately  in net proceeds from the private placement 
the warrants are subject to a call right in favor of the company to the extent that the closing price of the company s common stock exceeds per share for any consecutive trading day period following march  if the warrants are fully exercised  of which there can be no assurance  these warrants would provide approximately  of additional capital 
cash proceeds as of june  the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  and working capital of  as of june   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and a working capital deficit of  the increases in cash and working capital reflect approximately  of net proceeds from the private placements of the company s common stock and warrants in august and january commitments the company leases approximately  square feet of research laboratory  office and expansion space under an operating lease that expires may  the commitments under the lease agreement for the years ending june     and are     and  respectively 
from inception february  through june   expenditures for furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements aggregated  the company is committed to nearly  for sponsored research to academic institutions  of which  is payable over the next months 
remaining cortex commitments for the phase i clinical study for cx approximate  all of which is payable within the next months 
in june  the company received  from the institute  which will partially offset the company s costs for the testing in patients with mci 
given that cortex committed to use the funding 
table of contents from the institute solely for clinical trials  the company recorded the amounts received as restricted cash in its balance sheet 
provided that cortex complies with the conditions of the funding agreement  repayment of the advance shall not be required unless cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical trials for alzheimer s disease 
upon such potential clinical trials  repayment would include interest computed at a rate equal to one half of the prime lending rate 
in lieu of cash  in the event of repayment the institute may elect to receive the balance of outstanding principal and accrued interest as shares of cortex common stock 
the conversion price for such form of repayment shall initially equal per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations as of june  contractual obligations payments due by period total less then year years years more than years operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap other contractual obligations total these liabilities represent the company s unearned licensing revenues from its  non refundable  upfront payment that it received from servier in october these unearned revenues are amortized as revenue ratably over the research phase of the related agreement  which began in december and ends in december when the related revenue will be fully earned 
the liabilities do not represent a payment obligation of cortex  but rather an obligation to provide committed services 
staffing as of june   cortex had employees 
cortex anticipates a modest increase in the number of its full time employees within the coming year 
the company expects that it will require modest investments in plant and equipment within the same timeframe 
outlook cortex anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and scheduled research support payments from its agreements with servier will be sufficient to satisfy the company s capital requirements through at least mid calendar year additional funds will be required to continue operations beyond that time 
cortex may receive additional milestone payments from the organon and servier agreements  but there is no assurance that the company will receive such milestone payments within the desired timeframe  or at all 
see risk factors we will need additional capital in the future and  if it is not available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may need to scale back our research and development efforts and may be unable to continue our business operations 

table of contents in order to provide for both its longer term spending requirements  the company is presently seeking collaborative or other arrangements with larger pharmaceutical companies 
under these agreements  it is intended that such companies would provide additional capital to the company in exchange for exclusive or non exclusive license or other rights to certain of the technologies and products the company is developing 
competition for such arrangements is intense  however  with a large number of biopharmaceutical companies attempting to secure alliances with more established pharmaceutical companies 
although the company has been engaged in discussions with candidate companies  there is no assurance that an agreement or agreements will arise from these discussions in a timely manner  or at all  or that revenues that may be generated thereby will offset operating expenses sufficiently to reduce the company s short and longer term funding requirements 
because there is no assurance that the company will secure additional corporate partnerships  the company may raise additional capital through the sale of debt or equity securities 
there is no assurance that funds will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if equity securities are issued to raise additional funds  dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the company s proposed products are in the preclinical or early clinical stage of development and will require significant further research  development  clinical testing and regulatory clearances 
they are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies 
these risks include the possibilities that any or all of the proposed products will be found to be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  that the proposed products  although effective  will be uneconomical to market  that third parties may now or in the future hold proprietary rights that preclude the company from marketing them  or that third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict whether its research and development activities will result in any commercially viable products or applications 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the company does not expect to be able to commercialize any therapeutic drug for at least five years  either directly or through its prospective corporate partners or licensees 
there can be no assurance that the company s proposed products will prove to be safe or effective or receive regulatory approvals that are required for commercial sale

off balance sheet arrangements the company does not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements within the meaning of item a of regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its marketable securities and borrowing arrangement 
all investments in marketable securities are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the company is not subject to risks from currency rate fluctuations as it does not typically conduct transactions in foreign currencies 
in addition  the company does not utilize hedging contracts or similar instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises from financial instruments entered into in the normal course of business 
certain of the company s financial instruments are fixed rate  short term investments in government and corporate notes and bonds  which are available for sale and have been marked to market in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the investments  however  because these financial instruments are considered available for sale  all such changes are reflected in the financial statements in the period affected 
the company manages interest rate risk on its investment portfolio by matching scheduled investment maturities with its cash requirements 
as of june   the company s investment portfolio had a carrying amount of approximately  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 
table of contents from levels as of june   the resulting decline in the fair value of fixed rate bonds held within the portfolio would not be material to the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s borrowing consists solely of its advance from the institute  which is subject to potential repayment in the event that cortex enters an ampakine compound into phase iii clinical testing as a potential treatment for alzheimer s disease 
potential repayment would include interest accruing at a discount to the prime lending rate 
changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of such debt  but  based upon historical activity  such changes are not expected to have a material impact on earnings or cash flows 
as of june   the principal and accrued interest of the advance amounted to
