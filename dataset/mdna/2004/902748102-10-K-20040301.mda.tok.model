overview and strategy uil holdings corporation uil holdings operates in two principal lines of business utility and non utility 
the utility business consists of the operations of the united illuminating company ui  while the non utility business consists of the direct operations of xcelecom  inc xcelecom and american payment systems  inc aps  discontinued operations 
the non utility business also includes united capital investments  inc uci  and united bridgeport energy  inc ube  entities which indirectly support the operations of their respective passive investments 
as a result of connecticut s electric industry restructuring legislation  ui divested its ownership interests in generation facilities 
over the past four years uil holdings invested the proceeds of the sale of ui s generation facilities in non utility businesses to offset the expected reduction in utility earnings resulting from this restructuring 
some of these investments have not generated expected results due to a number of factors including the following a slow economy resulting in less construction business with lower margins for xcelecom  poor investment market conditions offsetting the value of uci s passive investments  high natural gas prices affecting the value of ube  and contract issues related to certain xcelecom projects 
uil holdings overall corporate strategy is to create shareholder value by actively managing the ui and xcelecom operating businesses to maximize earnings and cash flow  while providing superior reliability and customer satisfaction within its service territory 
uil holdings plans to improve the value of both the utility and non utility businesses and investments through operating initiatives designed to improve results and strategic objectives designed to increase value 
in particular  uil holdings plans to actively manage its costs  capitalize on synergies within the xcelecom operating segment to improve performance  and evaluate the possible restructuring or refinancing of certain of the passive investments 
the united illuminating company ui  the largest business unit of uil holdings  is a transmission and distribution electric utility whose primary objective is to provide reliable  cost effective service to the customers in the seventeen towns or cities in which it operates 
to provide reliable service  management will prudently invest in  and maintain  its transmission and distribution infrastructure 
as such  ui  together with the connecticut light and power company which also provides electric transmission and distribution service in connecticut has applied for siting approval to construct a major transmission upgrade in southwest connecticut 
ui plans to manage operating and maintenance costs to optimize return on equity  earnings and cash flow 
while revenues are expected to remain level  earnings from ui s cta component are expected to decline over time due to the planned amortization and resulting reduction in the stranded cost rate base 
ui s investment in infrastructure may not offset the decline of the stranded cost rate base  as the opportunity to invest in transmission infrastructure is limited by the size of its service territory 
xcelecom  inc 
xcelecom  the second largest business unit of uil holdings  is an electrical and mechanical contractor and voice data video design company that operates in the eastern portion of the united states 
xcelecom was built through a series of acquisitions over the past four years 
xcelecom s primary objective is to continue to improve its operating performance in the markets that it serves 
xcelecom expects to improve performance  in part  by capitalizing on synergies throughout its network of subsidiaries  including best practices for safety and risk management  project management and estimation  information systems  cross sales development and cash management and banking 
through these and other initiatives  xcelecom plans to manage operating costs to maximize earnings and cash flow that will be used to meet substantially all of the operating and most contractual commitments of its business 
over the last several years  xcelecom has expanded its business by pursuing an aggressive acquisition program 
due to the effects of the economic downturn on xcelecom s business  in addition to the lack of available and potentially desirable acquisitions  xcelecom has curtailed its acquisition program 
xcelecom currently does not intend to grow materially through acquisitions in the foreseeable future  however  it will continually evaluate acquisition prospects that could complement and expand its existing business platforms

american payment systems  inc 
aps is a walk in bill payment and financial services company that operates in states 
through uil holdings investment  aps became a nationwide leader in the walk in bill payment business 
while aps was successful under uil holdings ownership  management believes that a company specializing in payment processing or financial services  such as checkfree corporation checkfree  could accelerate the future success of aps 
accordingly  on december   uil holdings entered into an agreement to sell aps to checkfree  a leading provider of financial electronic commerce services and products 
under the terms of the agreement  and pending receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of customary closing conditions  checkfree will pay approximately million in cash for the outstanding stock of aps 
the transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of  with the resulting gain on sale to be recognized at that time 
uil holdings currently plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
checkfree will not be acquiring aps telephony assets  which includes aps ownership interest in cellcards of illinois  llc cci 
following execution of the agreement to sell aps  management determined that the telephony business is not part of uil holdings overall strategic business focus  and therefore developed a plan to pursue the sale of aps telephony assets 
as part of that plan  on february   cci was sold for book value to an independent third party 
the effects of the decision to dispose of aps telephony assets  along with the agreements to sell aps and cci  will eliminate the aps reporting segment 
accordingly  aps has been categorized as held for sale for financial accounting purposes as of december   and as such  its results are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
major influences on financial condition uil holdings corporation uil holdings financial condition and financing capability will be dependent on many factors  including the level of income and cash flow of uil holdings subsidiaries  conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  interest rates  legislative and regulatory developments  and the ability to retain key personnel 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations for uil holdings operating subsidiaries ui  xcelecom and aps 
these operations depend on the continued efforts of their respective current and future executive officers  senior management and management personnel 
xcelecom has acquired a number of companies in the past 
the success of these acquisitions is dependent on the continued involvement of the operating management of these entities 
uil holdings cannot guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time 
if uil holdings were to lose a number of key personnel  its operations could be adversely affected 
the united illuminating company ui is an electric transmission and distribution utility whose structure and operations are significantly affected by legislation and regulation 
ui s rates and authorized return on equity are regulated by the federal energy regulation commission ferc and the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
legislation and regulatory decisions implementing the legislation establish a framework for ui s operations 
primary factors affecting ui s financial results  in addition to legislation and regulation  are operational matters such as sales volume  major weather disturbances  ability to control expenses  and capital expenditures 
ui expects significant growth in its capital investment in transmission  and has applied for siting approval to construct a major transmission project in southwest connecticut 
legislation state legislation has significantly restructured the electric utility industry in connecticut 
the primary restructuring legislation includes public act the restructuring legislation and public act  as amended in part by public act the restructuring legislation 
as a result of the restructuring legislation  ui divested its non nuclear generation assets in  and divested its nuclear generation assets in and since  ui s retail customers have been able to choose their electricity suppliers 
during  the restructuring legislation required ui to offer retail service to its customers under a regulated standard offer rate to retail customers who did not choose an alternate electricity supplier 
the restructuring legislation requires that ui offer a transitional standard offer rate during the period january  december  to retail customers who do not choose an alternate electric supplier 
the restructuring legislation provides for ui to recover its costs of acquiring and providing generation services  and directed the dpuc to establish each electric distribution company s transitional standard offer rates 
as part of the restructuring pursuant to the restructuring legislation  ui s distribution and transmission rates were unbundled on customers bills  which also included separate charges as of january  for a competitive transition assessment cta  generation services charge gsc  conservation and load management c lm charge  renewable energy investment rei charge  and systems benefits charge sbc 
as of january   federally mandated congestion costs  defined by the restructuring legislation to include the costs of regional standard market design  are also identified separately on customers bills in accordance with the legislation 
the restructuring legislation makes other changes to the restructuring legislation  such as the imposition of renewable portfolio standards  the support of the development of renewable energy resources  and supplier of last resort service after the transitional standard offer period ends  and a requirement that any new rate case filings include a four year rate plan proposal 
the restructuring legislation provides for ui to collect a fee of kilowatt hour from transitional standard offer service customers  beginning january   as compensation for providing transitional standard offer service 
this fee is included in the amounts charged to transitional standard offer customers  and is excluded by the legislation from determinations of whether ui s rates are just and reasonable 
for  this fee is expected to generate approximately million to million in revenue 
the restructuring legislation also provides for the dpuc to establish an incentive plan for the procurement of long term contracts for transitional standard offer service that compares ui s actual average contract price to a regional average price for electricity  making adjustments as deemed appropriate by the dpuc 
if ui s price is lower than the average  the legislation provides for the plan to allocate kilowatt hour of transitional standard offer service to the distribution company 
the dpuc has not yet established an incentive plan or made any determination with respect to the incentive fee 
regulation in december  the dpuc established ui s transitional standard offer rates to be effective january   in accordance with the restructuring legislation 
during  it is expected that the dpuc will continue its implementation of other provisions of the restructuring legislation 
the dpuc s decision establishing the transitional standard offer rates determined that ui s rates complied in all respects with the restructuring legislation 
the transitional standard offer rates increase the gsc charged to customers for generation services compared to the standard offer gsc  modify the cta for some retail rates  and provide for the collection of federally mandated congestion costs 
the gsc rate changes reflect an increase  compared to the gsc  in the cost of generation services and related market costs  as well as a reduction in the adder included in the gsc expected charge in excess of expected cost 
the gsc for the transitional standard offer is designed to collect all of the costs of procuring and providing transitional standard offer service 
distribution and transmission rates remain unchanged from the levels established in september on september   the dpuc had reduced ui s customer rates in ui s retail customer ratemaking rate case proceeding 
the dpuc s decision provided for a million reduction in ui s annual revenue requirements  including a million reduction to ui s customer rates a reduction  million to be applied annually for additional funding of conservation programs  million to be applied annually for accelerated amortization to reduce stranded costs  and million to be applied to a combination of uncollectibles  taxes and rate base changes 
the final rate case decision established rates on the basis of an authorized return on equity of  excluding ui s investment in transmission rate base 
the decision further provided that earnings above the authorized return would be shared to customers and to net income  with the customers share divided equally between bill reductions and an accelerated amortization of stranded costs 
the rate case decision recognizes that the revenue requirements determination for transmission  including the applicable return on equity  is within the jurisdiction of the ferc 
ui s authorized return on equity for transmission is 
on march   the dpuc issued a decision granting ui s request to reopen the september rate case decision  to examine increased pension and postretirement benefits expenses of ui for on june   the dpuc issued a decision denying  without prejudice  ui s request for recovery of million in increased pension and postretirement benefits expenses 
on september   the dpuc granted ui s request to reopen the june  decision 
on november   ui and the prosecutorial division of the dpuc pro reached a settlement agreement  which was filed with the dpuc providing for the annual recovery by ui of an additional million of expenses effective with final dpuc approval of the agreement 
the settlement also would have modified the earnings sharing mechanism from to shareholders and to customers  to to shareholders and to customers  with the entire customer portion being utilized to reduce stranded costs 
the settlement agreement also stipulated that ui will not file a rate case before january  on february   the dpuc issued a draft decision that accepted the settlement agreement provided that ui and pro agreed to reduce the million annual recovery to million and to increase the customer portion of shared earnings in excess of the authorized return to from 
while ui believes million is not sufficient to offset the increased costs  it will offer some level of relief above what is currently included in rates 
as such  ui accepted the changes required by the draft decision 
on february   the dpuc issued a final decision approving the settlement with the specified modifications 
operations in implementing the restructuring legislation  ui established a distribution division and other unbundled components for accounting purposes  to reflect other unbundled components on customer bills 
initially  the distribution division included both transmission and distribution 
ui has now separated transmission from distribution into separate divisions for accounting purposes 
changes to income and expense items related to transmission and distribution have an immediate net income and earnings per share impact  while changes to items in other unbundled utility components do not 
the other components are the cta  the sbc  the gsc  the c lm charge  and rei charge 
the cta and sbc both earned an return on the equity portion of their respective rate bases until the september  effective date of the rate case decision  and thereafter in accordance with that decision 
those returns were achieved either by accruing additional amortization expenses  or by deferring such expenses  as required to achieve the authorized return 
amortization expenses in the cta and sbc components impact earnings indirectly through changes to rate base 
the gsc  c lm and rei are essentially pass through components revenues are matched to recover costs 
except for the procurement fee in gsc previously discussed  and a small management fee earned in the c lm component  expenses are either accrued or deferred or revenues are transferred such that there is no net income associated with these three unbundled components 
ui s cta collection recovers costs that have been reasonably incurred  or will be incurred  to meet its public service obligations and that will likely not otherwise be recoverable in a competitive market 
these stranded costs include above market long term purchased power contract obligations  regulatory asset recovery and above market investments in power plants 
subject to future regulatory changes to the cta rate or to the level of amortization  cta revenues are expected to remain relatively constant  with amortization increasing over time as the allowed earnings trend downward due to the decreasing rate base 
a significant amount of ui s earnings is generated by the authorized return on the equity portion of as yet unamortized stranded costs in the cta rate base 
the cta rate base earns exactly that return  no more and no less  by adjustments made to amortization expense in each period 
ui s earnings per share attributable to cta for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
a significant portion of ui s cash flow from operations is also generated from those earnings and from the recovery of the cta rate base 
cash flow from operations related to cta for the years ended december   and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
cta rate base has declined from year to year for a number of reasons  including amortization of stranded costs  the sale of the nuclear units  and any adjustments made through the annual dpuc review process 
the original rate base component of stranded costs  as of january   was million 
it has since declined to million at year end  million at year end  million at year end  and million at year end the result is subject to dpuc review  pursuant to an annual review of ui s cta revenues and expenses  and may be adjusted in accordance with that review 
during july  the dpuc issued an order requiring that the reduction of cta rate base utilizing excess gsc revenues be discontinued pursuant to the restructuring legislation 
ui s cta earnings will decrease while  based on ui s current projections  cash flow will remain fairly constant until stranded costs are fully amortized between and  depending upon the dpuc s future decisions which could affect future rates of stranded cost amortization 
the primary distribution division operational factors affecting ui s financial results are sales volume  ability to control expenses and capital expenditures 
retail electric sales volume can be significantly affected by economic growth and weather 
the weather can also have an impact on expenses  dependent on the level of work required as a result of storms or other extreme conditions 
ui s major expense components are purchased power  amortization of stranded costs  wages and benefits  depreciation  and regional network service rns transmission costs 
purchased power expenses are a pass through expense  collected from customers in the gsc and as federally mandated congestion costs 
on october   ui entered into an agreement with pseg energy resources trade llc pseg for the supply of all of ui s transitional standard offer generation service needs  excluding requirements for special contract customers  from january  through december   the end of the transitional standard offer period 
ui continues to purchase generation services pursuant to a december  agreement with dominion energy marketing dominion to supply special contract customers through december  the contract with pseg contains numerous financial assurances including a guaranty from pseg s parent company  pseg power  various credit requirements including maintaining a minimum moody s credit rating of baa or equivalent  and a letter of credit to secure performance through the initial stages of the contract 
ui is also required to maintain a minimum credit rating of baa or equivalent 
ui s current moody s credit rating is a  which is three levels above the required minimum 
prior to january   ui purchased generation services to supply standard offer service pursuant to the agreement with dominion 
ui s agreement with dominion replaced an earlier wholesale power agreement and other related agreements with enron power marketing  inc epmi 
refer to note j  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in order to maintain and improve its electricity delivery system and to provide quality customer service  ui is required to spend a significant amount each year on capital projects in the distribution and transmission divisions 
a large portion of the funds required for capital projects is provided internally through the recovery of depreciation and from amortization of stranded costs 
the remainder must be financed externally 
for more information  see capital expenditure program and liquidity and capital resources included later in this item of this form k 
ui  together with the connecticut light and power company  has filed with the connecticut siting council an application for a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to construct a kilovolt transmission line from middletown  connecticut to norwalk  connecticut 
this approximately million project is necessary to improve the reliability of the transmission system in southwest connecticut 
the two companies are working together for permitting  and will each construct  own and operate its respective portion of the transmission line and related facilities 
ui will construct  own  and operate transmission and substation facilities comprising approximately of the total project 
a decision by the connecticut siting council is presently expected in october other governmental permitting  together with approvals from iso new england  will be required for the project  and the total project cost could change depending on final permit requirements and final specifications 
ui s costs for the project are expected to be included in and recovered through transmission rates under ferc jurisdiction 
risk management and insurance ui s primary risk management and insurance exposures include bodily injury  property damage  fiduciary responsibility  and injured workers compensation 
ui is insured for general liability  automobile liability  property loss  fiduciary liability and workers compensation liability 
ui s general liability and automobile liability programs provide insurance coverage for third party liability claims for bodily injury including pain and suffering and property damage  subject to a deductible 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
ui reviews the general liability reserves quarterly to ensure that ui is adequately reserved 
the reserve is based on historical claims  business events  industry averages and actuarial studies 
insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors such as incidents incurred but not reported and awards greater than expected  therefore reserve adjustments may become necessary as cases unfold 
ui insures its own property subject to deductibles depending on the type of property 
ui s fiduciary liability program and workers compensation program provides insurance coverage  subject to deductibles as well

as a result of the pending sale of aps to checkfree  and management s decision to dispose of aps telephony assets  there are now two principal risks affecting the financial condition of aps and uil holdings operating risk and disposition risk 
operating risk relates to the risk factors inherent in aps business operations  whereas disposition risk relates to the risk factors that could impact the outcome of the potential sale of aps  and separately the sale of aps remaining telephony assets 
the four primary operating risk factors affecting the financial results of aps and its subsidiaries are the ability to recruit and retain agents  the ability to manage and control agent fraud to ensure that the agents are depositing the funds collected from the consumers in a timely fashion the maintenance of internal control systems and procedures to account for the movement of significant amounts of cash from the agents to aps and on to the biller  on whose behalf the funds are collected  and compliance with increasingly complex regulatory requirements applicable to its business 
aps has programs and procedures in place to mitigate the operating risk factors described above 
these include a formal program to recruit and train agents  as well as processes to monitor cash movements and reconcile high dollar volume accounts on a daily basis 
in addition  aps reviews its internal control systems and procedures to ensure that these controls are maintained in an effective manner and regularly evaluates  and when deemed appropriate implements new technologies to improve the existing internal control systems and procedures 
these operating risks will no longer affect uil holdings upon closing of the sale of aps to checkfree 
there are significant disposition risks relating to the potential sale of aps to checkfree 
uil holdings and checkfree made the required filings under the federal hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act  and as of january   the mandatory waiting periods thereunder expired 
in addition  the parties have made notice filings or submitted applications for approval of the transaction to state regulatory authorities in more than thirty states in which aps holds licenses in connection with its money transmittal business 
the sale of aps to checkfree will not close until certain of those state regulatory authorities have approved the transaction 
aps telephony assets primarily consist of its ownership interest in cci  and point of sale activation posa technology 
cci sells prepaid long distance telephone service  prepaid telephone calling cards and prepaid wireless telephone service in check cashing and convenience store locations nationwide  as well as through aps network of agents 
as part of management s plan to divest aps telephony assets  cci was sold for book value to an independent third party on february  as a result of the sale  neither aps  nor uil holdings will be subject to the put option previously in place with respect to cci pursuant to which the other owners of cci had a put option to require aps to purchase the remaining of cci beginning in may separately  in connection with the acquisition of the posa technology in  aps loaned money to the vendor from which the technology was acquired 
subsequently the vendor defaulted under the loan and as part of the foreclosure procedures the remaining loan balance was restructured 
as consideration for an accelerated payment schedule  aps agreed to forgive a portion of the outstanding loan balance  bringing the restructured amount due to million 
the accelerated payment schedule calls for three principal payments  all to be received within the first quarter of if any of the payments are delinquent  interest will be charged daily at graduated rates  beginning on the day after the payment was due 
any interest payments are due weekly  with full settlement of any delinquent principal due before the end of the second quarter of in january  all posa assets  including the aforementioned loan receivable  were transferred from aps to one of uil holdings non utility subsidiaries 
xcelecom  inc 
the principal factors affecting the financial results of xcelecom and its subsidiaries are construction and technology spending  competition  fixed priced contract estimation and bidding  work related hazards and insurance  attracting and retaining management expertise  overall liquidity and ability to obtain surety bonding  and risks of attaining required labor productivity levels to meet or exceed contract estimates 
additional risk factors include general economic conditions  the pace of technological changes  recoverability and potential for impairment of goodwill  and collectibility of receivables 
more than half of xcelecom s business involves the installation of electrical  mechanical and integrated network information systems in newly constructed and renovated buildings and plants 
downturns in levels of construction starts and business spending can have a material adverse effect on xcelecom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  xcelecom s business is subject to seasonal variations in operations and demand that affect the construction business  particularly in new construction 
quarterly results may also be affected by regional economic conditions 
accordingly  xcelecom s performance in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other quarter or for the entire year 
the competitive bidding process for new business contracts normally intensifies during economic downturns  leading to lower profit margins and an increased potential for project cost overruns or losses 
xcelecom s contracts are entered into principally on the basis of competitive bids 
the final terms and prices of those contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer 
although contract terms vary considerably  most are made on either a fixed price or unit price basis in which xcelecom agrees to do the work for a fixed amount for the entire project fixed price or for units of work performed unit price  although services are sometimes performed on a cost plus or time and materials basis 
xcelecom s most significant cost drivers are the cost of labor  including employee benefits  the cost of products and materials  and the cost of casualty insurance 
these costs may vary from the costs originally estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price and unit price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits for a project differing from those originally estimated and could result in losses on projects 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
hazards related to xcelecom s industry include  but are not limited to  electrocutions  fires  mechanical failures  and transportation accidents 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  and may result in suspension of operations 
xcelecom s third party insurance is subject to large deductibles for which reserves are established 
accordingly  xcelecom self insures for this exposure 
xcelecom believes its insurance and provisions for self insurance of deductibles are adequate to cover reasonably foreseeable losses and liabilities 
losses impacting self insurance provisions or exceeding insurance limits could impact xcelecom s operating results 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on xcelecom s business  financial condition and results of operations 
xcelecom s operations depend on the continued efforts of current and future executive officers  senior management and management personnel at the companies which have been acquired 
certain steps taken to mitigate the risk of loss of key personnel of acquired companies were the use of earn out payments  promissory notes  and covenant not to compete agreements 
a criterion used in evaluating acquisition candidates was the quality of their management 
there is no guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or subsidiary level will continue in their capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of a group of key personnel could adversely affect xcelecom s operations 
billings under fixed price contracts are generally based upon achieving certain benchmarks and will be accepted by the customer once it is demonstrated that those benchmarks have been met 
if xcelecom is unable to show the compliance with billing requests  or fails to issue a project billing  the likelihood of collection could be delayed or impaired  which could have a materially adverse effect on operations 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for unknown collection issues is maintained  in addition to reserves for specific accounts receivable where collection is considered doubtful 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  customers access to capital  customers willingness to pay  general economic conditions and the ongoing relationships with customers 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately one third of xcelecom s construction related business has required bonds 
while xcelecom has enjoyed a longstanding relationship with its surety  current market conditions as well as changes in the surety s assessment of xcelecom s operating and financial risk could cause the surety to decline to issue bonds for work 
if that were to occur  alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that such alternatives could be easily achieved 
accordingly  if xcelecom were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  its operating results could be adversely impacted 
xcelecom s business is primarily driven by labor 
the ability to perform contracts at acceptable margins depends on the ability to deliver substantial labor productivity 
it cannot be guaranteed that productivity will continue at acceptable levels for a particular period of time 
the loss of productivity could adversely affect the margins on existing contracts or the ability to obtain new contracts 
historically  a significant amount of xcelecom s growth has come through acquisitions 
from july of to xcelecom s last significant acquisition in april of  xcelecom made acquisitions 
xcelecom currently does not intend to grow materially through acquisitions in the foreseeable future  however  it will continually evaluate acquisition prospects to complement and expand its existing business platforms 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition effort and the associated potential capital commitments cannot be predicted 
each acquisition involves a number of risks 
these risks include the diversion of management s attention from existing businesses to integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  possible adverse effects on operating results during the integration process  and possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the combination 
if future acquisitions do not perform as expected  xcelecom may be required to write off some or all of the value of any goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisitions 
financial results may also be impacted by the degree of integration of acquisitions  including the ability to achieve synergies over the network of subsidiaries 
xcelecom s revenue growth over the past several years has been generated principally through acquisitions 
in the absence of economic improvement in the regional markets in which xcelecom operates  xcelecom does not expect any material revenue growth in the computer industry in general has felt the effects of the slowdown in the united states economy  and xcelecom has specifically seen a decrease in demand for the products and services it sells 
sales can be dependent on specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on xcelecom s sales if they failed to react in a timely manner to such changes 
operating results are also highly dependent upon the level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales which fluctuates due to numerous factors  including changes in prices from suppliers  reductions in the amount of supplier reimbursements that are made available  changes in customer mix  the relative mix of products sold during the period  general competitive conditions  the availability of opportunistic purchases and opportunities to increase market share 
in addition  expense levels  including the costs and salaries incurred in connection with the hiring of sales and technical services personnel  are based  in part  on anticipated sales 
therefore  xcelecom may not be able to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales or margin shortfalls 
as a result  comparisons of xcelecom s quarterly financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
cost drivers as a service business  xcelecom s cost structure is highly variable 
primary costs include labor  materials and insurance 
approximately of costs are derived from labor and related expenses 
for the years ended december   and  labor related expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
approximately of xcelecom s costs incurred are for materials installed on projects and equipment and other products sold to customers 
this component of the expense structure is variable based on the demand for services 
costs are generally incurred for materials once work begins on a project or a customer order is received 
materials are ordered when needed  shipped directly to the jobsite or customer facility  and installed within days 
materials consist of commodity based items such as conduit  pipe  data cabling  wire and fuses as well as specialty items such as fixtures  switchgear  switches and routers  servers and control panels 
for the years ended december   and  material and equipment expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively 
regulations xcelecom s operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including licensing requirements applicable to electricians  steamfitters and plumbers  building  mechanical and electrical codes  regulations relating to consumer protection  including those governing residential service agreements  and regulations relating to worker safety and protection of the environment 
xcelecom believes they have all licenses required to conduct operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of operating licenses or an inability to perform government work 
many state and local regulations governing electricians  steamfitters and plumbers require permits and licenses to be held by individuals 
in some cases  a required permit or license held by a single individual may be sufficient to authorize specified activities for all employees who work in the state or county that issued the permit or license 
it is xcelecom s policy to ensure that  where possible  any permits or licenses that may be material to its operations in a particular geographic area are held by multiple xcelecom employees within that area 
risk management and insurance the primary risks in xcelecom s operations include health  bodily injury  property damage and injured workers compensation 
xcelecom is insured for workers compensation  automobile liability  general liability and employee related health care claims  subject to large deductibles 
a general liability program provides coverage for bodily injury and property damage neither expected nor intended 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based upon our estimates of the liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the accruals are derived from actuarial studies  known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
xcelecom believes such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of xcelecom s safety programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation  adjustments to the reserve may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
united capital investments  inc 
uci s investments in the venture funds described at overview and strategy were viewed as an opportunity to earn reasonable returns and promote local economic development 
due to the nature of its investments and market conditions  the value of the zero stage vi fund has decreased substantially since the end of the other two funds have been established more recently and are not yet fully invested 
excluding the effects of fund management fees and syndication costs  these funds have retained their market value 
the cross sound project has been opposed on environmental  safety  and economic concerns by a number of public officials and private groups who have participated actively in governmental permitting proceedings relative to the project 
in january  the connecticut siting council csc granted a certificate of environmental compatibility and public need to construct the cable 
the connecticut attorney general appealed the csc s decision without success to the connecticut superior court 
he also appealed the superior court s decision to the connecticut supreme court  but in september withdrew the appeal  leaving intact the superior court s decision upholding the csc approval 
the project received all necessary permits prior to the cable being installed in the spring of after installation  it was determined that several sections of the cable in new haven harbor were not buried to the depths required by the permits 
the authorized depth was not achieved due to the obstruction of rock ledge  sediment and other more movable types of obstruction  such as tree stumps and metal plate debris 
the connecticut department of environmental protection cdep and united states army corp of engineers have raised no environmental or navigational concerns related to operation of the cable as currently buried  however  the cdep has indicated that under the current permit  the permit depth must be reached before commercial operation can begin 
cross sound is developing proposals for achieving the required burial depth 
on june  cross sound submitted a new permit application to the cdep requesting that the cdep issue a permit to allow cross sound to operate the cable as installed in its current location through december  a connecticut legislative moratorium on installing new gas and utility lines across long island sound through early june has been enacted 
this moratorium has impacted the permitting process 
cross sound expects the cdep to act on cross sound s new permit application no later than when the moratorium expires 
on august   the day of the blackout that affected the northeast and the upper midwest areas of the united states as well as portions of canada  the department of energy doe declared a federal emergency and issued an emergency order to allow immediate operation of the cross sound cable through september  on august  the doe issued a new order for the cable to operate until all of the appropriate actions that should be taken to prevent future power outages in the region have been identified and implemented 
on august   the connecticut attorney general and the cdep filed a request for stay or rehearing to the doe of the august doe emergency order 
briefs were filed in october and november and a decision by the doe is expected sometime in the first half of on september   the connecticut attorney general also filed an appeal to the federal circuit court of appeals in new york of the august doe emergency order 
this appeal cannot proceed before the doe issues its decision on stay or rehearing 
the range of outcomes from the doe decision and future court  agency and legislative actions that may affect the operation of the cable  includes the doe order continues in effect  and the cable continues to operate  the doe order is revoked  and connecticut s moratorium is extended and not struck down on legal grounds  thus preventing operation  the doe order is revoked  and the cdep grants a permit modification or approves remediation  enabling the cable to operate  and federal legislation requires that the cable be permitted to continue to operate 
on october   the cdep issued a request for proposal to hire an independent consultant to compare the environmental impacts of cable operation in the current location with the impacts that would result from reburying the cable to the permitted depth 
the study results are due by june  uci expects the study results will show that the cable  operating in its current location  poses no harm to the environment 
such conclusion could potentially help cross sound achieve commercial operation at a faster pace 
uci s share of the estimated total final cost of the project is million 
as of december   uci s share of the actual project cost for the cross sound cable was million 
uci has provided an equity infusion of million to cross sound and uil holdings loaned million to cross sound 
in addition  a guarantee of million  in support of hydro quebec s guarantees to third parties in connection with the construction of the project has been provided 
it is expected that any obligations of cross sound that are supported by the guarantee would be funded by capital contributions from the owners  who are affiliates of the guarantors  in amounts in proportion of their respective ownership shares of cross sound 
no liability was recorded related to the guarantee  as the likelihood of uil holdings having to perform under the guarantee is remote 
upon commercial operation  the loan from uil holdings is expected to be refinanced with external project financing 
uci will be responsible for of any additional cost of project completion over the estimated amount 
uci has recorded million in income for the project in under the provisions of an interim operating contract that covers cross sound s compensation for the operation of the cable under the emergency order 
although the terms of the interim contract have been approved by the long island power authority s lipa board of trustees  approval by the new york state comptroller s office is still required 
in addition  ferc approval is required for the interim operating contract 
resolution of permit issues for commercial operation of the cable is still pending 
united bridgeport energy  inc 
the principal factors which affect the financial condition of ube are natural gas prices  maintenance costs  installed capability icap revenues  and intercompany financing costs 
as ube holds a minority interest in be  there are additional risk factors associated with the activities of the majority owner  an affiliate of duke energy 
results at ube continue to be hampered by high natural gas prices that drive down both margins and sales volumes at be 
although natural gas prices have remained at elevated levels in recent years  doe annual energy outlook projections show improving conditions in the future 
based on these projections no conditions were noted to give rise to an impairment with respect to the current million carrying value of the investment in be 
ube will continue to monitor its investment in be for recoverability  as changes in the assumptions noted could have a negative impact on the carrying value of the investment in the future 
although routine maintenance is performed on the plant on a regular basis  from time to time the plant must be brought offline for a major overhaul 
the results did not include any significant major overhaul expenses 
the next major overhaul is planned for under the current contract  the plant has begun incurring some of these costs  and they are being accrued until the outage occurs 
be has sufficient cash to fund these costs in  however  based on the current earnings estimate  be will require additional capital calls from the owners to cover the additional costs in when the outage occurs 
based on current projections  ube s additional capital call could be as great as million 
the icap market is designed to offer an incentive to developers to build adequate generating capacity 
be receives icap revenues based on the plant s installed capacity 
the plant began initial operation with a multi year contract for icap 
since the contract ended in  be has only been able to sell its icap in the forward month market at a much lower price  reducing icap revenues by approximately to 
ferc has directed iso ne to develop a locational installed capacity market  with the intent to provide higher capacity payments to generators within designated congestion areas  this is scheduled to enter the market in june the full impact that locational icap will have is not known at this time  although it is expected to have a positive effect on be 
through the end of  any capital requirements  including amounts which were invested in be  that exceeded ube s available cash were provided by uil holdings in the form of capital contributions and intercompany loans 
any amounts loaned to ube by uil holdings were interest bearing 
due to the relatively low amounts of cash available at ube to pay interest  the intercompany loans have been restructured to equity in the majority owner of be  an affiliate of duke energy  has a interest in duke energy trading and marketing detm which is a joint venture with exxon mobil corporation 
be has an agreement through august with detm that gives detm the right to deliver natural gas to the facility and market all the electricity generated by the facility 
detm reimburses be under a formula based on the difference between gas costs and electric prices 
in early january  duke energy announced it plans to wind down detm as part of a plan to restructure its merchant energy business 
ube does not anticipate these plans to have a negative impact on the operations of be at this time 
capital expenditure program uil holdings estimated capital expenditure program is budgeted as follows total in millions ui distribution transmission southwest connecticut reliability project information technology real estate other total ui non utility xcelecom capital expenditures earn out payments promissory note payments non compete payments xcelecom subtotal ube capital call net uci other subtotal continuing operations discontinued operations capital expenditures total uil holdings these amounts represent ui s current estimates based upon the proposed configuration of the transmission lines 
there has been opposition to the planned configuration as proposed  particularly the overhead portions  and it has yet to be approved by the connecticut siting council 
if the project is approved in a form different than proposed  these estimates will change accordingly 
in january  ui exercised the million purchase option in connection with its capital lease for the electric system work center property located in shelton  connecticut 
ui is considering the replacement of this property in  but the potential sale of the existing property is not included in the above amounts 
xcelecom s earn out payments are payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies and are contingent on various future financial results of each company 
the actual payments may vary widely from these estimated amounts 
xcelecom s promissory note payments are amounts payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies 
several of the promissory notes have indemnification provisions that may cause the principal balance to change 
xcelecom s non compete payments are amounts payable to the former owners of certain acquired companies 
the net capital calls at ube are payable in the years when the plant is scheduled for major overhaul work 
represents required capital expenditures of aps  primarily computer related equipment  through the first half of the aps sale transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of  at which time any future capital expenditure obligations would transfer to the new owner 
liquidity and capital resources uil holdings capital requirements are presently projected as follows in millions unrestricted cash and temporary cash investments on hand beginning of year short term debt beginning of year funds from operations before dividends ui xcelecom minority interest investment other uil corporate unallocated subtotal from operating discontinued operations total funds from operations before dividends less capital expenditures and investing activities ui xcelecom minority interest investment other uil corporate unallocated subtotal from operating discontinued operations total capital expenditures proceeds from cross sound cable project loan total capital expenditures and investing activities plus intercompany dividends ui uci uil corporate unallocated total intercompany dividends less common dividends to shareowners plus net cash after tax from aps sale and telephony assets sale cash available required to pay debt maturities and redemptions less maturities and mandatory redemptions uil maturities and mandatory redemptions ui external financing requirements surplus plus issuance of long term debt increase decrease in short term borrowings short term borrowings temp cash investments ui end of year uil corporate and other end of year total end of year balance excludes restricted cash in ui of million  xcelecom of million and aps discontinued operations of million 
the unrestricted cash and temporary cash investments on hand at the beginning of include million at uil corporate  at ui  million at aps and million at xcelecom 
the short term borrowing balance at december  was million  all of it borrowings by uil corporate 
funds from operations before dividends  capital expenditures and investing activities and external financing requirements surplus are estimates based on current earnings  dividend levels and cash flow projections 
all of these estimates are subject to continual review by the uil holdings board of directors and change due to future events and conditions that may be substantially different from those used in developing the projections 
the ability of ui to maintain the shareholder level of dividends to uil holdings  while maintaining its service and reliability levels to its customers  depends on ui s free cash flow cash flow from operation activities less capital expenditures  and  to some extent  ui s net income level 
if ui continues to pay dividends to uil holdings that are in excess of ui s net income  then ui s equity capitalization ratio  ultimately used to determine the equity portion of ui s regulated rate base and  therefore  ui s regulated earnings for common stock  will continue to decline 
under that circumstance  ui can avoid a decrease in its equity ratio only if it generates enough cash to pay the dividend and to reduce long term debt by a proportionate amount 
the ability of ui to achieve such results cannot be assured 
see the major influences on financial condition section for more information 
ui will issue short term debt to finance a portion of its swct reliability project 
during the construction period  ui would earn afudc on the construction work in process balance for this project 
when the project is completed and placed in service  currently anticipated in  ui would likely procure permanent financing for the asset 
in and beyond  ui is currently expected to continue to pay dividends to uil holdings in the amount necessary for uil holdings to pay a dividend to shareholders  approximately million per share 
this amount is not as much as the million and million ui provided in and  respectively 
in those years  ui was generating more cash than it needed  primarily through the cta  and ui was able to dividend extra amounts to uil holdings while maintaining an appropriate equity capitalization ratio because ui eliminated approximately million of long term debt through the termination of the seabrook sale leaseback agreement at the time of the sale of the plant 
primarily due to ui s projected capital expenditure program  particularly for transmission projects  ui may have to borrow additional funds in and beyond 
also  the currently expected future dividend amounts from ui to uil holdings  at the rate of uil holdings external dividend payments  could be in excess of ui s expected earnings for those years 
this could reduce ui s equity capitalization ratio from the current 
these factors could impact ui s ability to continue providing  through dividends from earnings to uil holdings  the amount of uil holdings dividends to shareholders 
additionally  uil corporate will continue to be entirely dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries and from external borrowings to provide the cash necessary for debt service  to pay administrative costs  to meet other contractual obligations that cannot be met by the non utility subsidiaries  and to pay common dividends to uil holdings shareholders 
the amount of uil holdings cash dividends in and beyond is expected to be equal to the current dividend of per share  with the number of shares growing slightly  through the issuance of esop shares  from the million shares outstanding at year end maintenance of the dividend beyond  both from a payout ratio perspective and from a cash flow perspective  will be dependent on the ability of ui and or uil holdings non utility businesses to generate cash and pay dividends to uil holdings at an appropriate level  and to improve earnings to a level above the dividend  as well as uil holdings ability to borrow for capital needs 
uil holdings current strategy for xcelecom and its minority interest investments calls for those entities to be largely cash self sufficient going forward 
however  the ability of these entities  particularly the minority interest investments  to improve earnings  cash flow  and their ability to dividend cash to uil holdings without causing harm to their own operations or financial conditions cannot be assured 
see the major influences on financial condition section of this item for more information 
uil holdings and its subsidiaries will continue their efforts to improve the earnings and cash flow position of uil holdings  to strengthen its financial position  and improve its dividend to earnings payout ratio to a more robust level 
all capital requirements that exceed available cash will have to be provided by external financing 
although there is no commitment to provide such financing from any source of funds  other than a million revolving credit agreement that uil holdings has with a group of banks  and a million revolving credit agreement that xcelecom has with two banks  future external financing needs are expected to be satisfied by the issuance of additional short term and long term debt 
the continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors  including conditions in the securities markets  economic conditions  and future income and cash flow
