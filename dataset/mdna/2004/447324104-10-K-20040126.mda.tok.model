per share  compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
we attribute our return to profitability to incremental sales from a new  entry level machine model the vm introduced in late fiscal  strengthening european currencies in relation to the us dollar and the implementation of restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past months 
results for fiscal were adversely impacted by million of restructuring expense 
we developed the vm to improve our competitiveness in the entry level machining center market 
the vm has been successful in both the domestic and international markets 
in the united states  we have obtained an approximate market share in the entry level machining center market 
in fiscal  we shipped vm units worldwide  which resulted in approximately million of incremental machine sales 
our operating results for fiscal were also favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the euro  in relation to the us dollar when translating foreign sales and service fees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as noted in the following table  approximately of our net sales and service fees in fiscal were derived from european markets 
the weighted average exchange rate for the euro during fiscal was  as compared to 
for fiscal  an increase of 
net sales and service fees by geographic region the following tables set forth net sales by geographic region for the years ended october  and in thousands october  americas   europe   asia pacific   total   total sales and service fees on a worldwide basis were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a million  or  increase 
however  on a constant dollar basis  sales and service fees were million  a million decrease 
in the americas  sales and service fees from continuing products and services increased million  or  due primarily to the successful introduction of the vm  in late fiscal this increase was offset by a decrease of million in sales of discontinued products  the liquidation of which was substantially completed in fiscal in europe  sales and service fees increased by million as a result of the favorable effect of stronger european currencies 
however  when measured at constant exchange rates  sales and service fees in europe decreased million  or  reflecting the continuing weakness in industrial equipment spending and reduced consumption of machine tools by many manufacturing companies  particularly in germany 
sales and service fees in asia pacific were not significantly affected by currency rates  but reflect improved activity in asian markets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales and service fees improved over the first three fiscal quarters  reflecting an improvement in worldwide computerized machine tool demand from the depressed levels of the past three years 
net sales and service fees by product category the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product category for years ended october  and in thousands october  continuing products and services computerized machine tools   computer control systems and software   service parts   service fees   total   discontinued products and services  total   discontinued product sales were made solely in the united states 
sales of continuing machine tool products increased million  or  of which million was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation 
unit shipments of continuing machine tool models increased  as sales of the vm more than offset a decline in the balance of the product line 
the average net selling price per unit of continuing machine tool models decreased approximately due to product mix and discounting  the effects of which were partially offset by the favorable effects of currency translation 
when measured at constant exchange rates  the average net selling price per continuing unit declined approximately 
new order bookings for fiscal were million  an increase of as compared to million recorded in fiscal when measured at constant exchange rates  new order bookings increased million  or 
new order bookings for continuing products and services increased million  or  when measured at constant exchange rates 
the increase in orders for continuing products in constant us dollars was attributable to orders for the vm model  which more than offset the effect of weak order rates in the first nine months of fiscal related to the balance of the product line 
new order bookings increased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal and were million  million  million and million for each of the four quarters in fiscal backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  gross profit margin increased in fiscal to from excluding a million restructuring charge in fiscal  due in part to strengthening european currencies as well as previously reported employee cost reductions and fewer sales of discontinued products  which were liquidated at discounted prices 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal of million declined  or  from those of the corresponding period 
when measured at constant exchange rates  sg a expenses decreased million  or  from fiscal  as a result of previously reported employee cost reductions  lower research and development expenses  and reduced sales and marketing expenditures 
the decrease was offset  in part  by the effects of a weaker us dollar when translating expenses incurred outside the united states for financial reporting purposes 
other expense  net includes  related to certain stock options which are subject to variable plan accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
expense for this item in future periods will be directly impacted by changes in the price of our common stock until the options are exercised 
other expense  net in fiscal also includes currency exchange losses on inter company receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  net of gains or losses on related forward contracts  and other non operating income and expense items 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  we have net operating loss carryforwards for which we have a valuation reserve at october  the provision for income tax increased in fiscal because of increased earnings from our taxable foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal compared with fiscal our net loss for the year ended october   which was more than five times greater than that reported for fiscal  was due primarily to substantially lower sales and service fees as result of a continuing decline in machine tool orders in both the us and europe 
the association for manufacturing technology  the machine tool industry s trade association  reported that in  the us dollar value of orders for machine tools decreased  and there was a corresponding deterioration in our european markets 
also contributing to the loss for fiscal were restructuring and other special charges totaling million  which consisted primarily of a non cash inventory write downs of million  which were recorded as an increase in the cost of sales  and the write off of capitalized software development costs of million  which was recorded as a restructuring expense  b severance costs of million related to personnel reductions  and c a reserve of million of which  was recorded in the fourth fiscal quarter for potential expenditures that might be required pursuant to a disputed claim regarding a terminated facility lease in the united kingdom  which is more fully discussed below 
during fiscal  we discontinued several under performing product lines  and sold the related assets  to enable us to focus our resources and technology development on our core products 
these continuing core products  known as milling machines and vertical machining centers  consist primarily of general purpose computerized machine tools for the metal cutting industry into which our proprietary ultimax r software and computer control systems have been fully integrated 
discontinued and sold were the delta tm series computer control and related dynapath tm milling machine product line  and related parts and service activities  along with press brake product lines and all tooling products related to press brake applications 
these discontinued product lines were marketed exclusively in the united states 
during fiscal  we also eliminated domestic employee positions  which we expect will result in annual cost reductions of approximately million  of which million was realized in fiscal the positions that were eliminated were those related to the discontinued product lines as well as some positions associated with our realigned and consolidated domestic sales and service operations 
we previously occupied a facility located in england under a lease that expired in april the lease required that  following expiration of the lease  we make certain repairs to the facility resulting from deterioration of the facility during the lease term 
the scope and cost of the repairs alleged by the lessor to be required evolved throughout fiscal and as investigations and negotiations proceeded 
on september   we settled this claim with the lessor for pound  approximately million  which we had previously accrued 
the settlement payment was due and paid in the first quarter of fiscal the following tables set forth net sales by geographic region and product category for the years ended october  and in thousands net sales and service fees by geographic region october  americas   europe   asia pacific   total   net sales and service fees by product category october  continuing products and services computerized machine tools   computer control systems and software   service parts   service fees   total   discontinued products and services   total   our total sales and service fees were million in fiscal  a million  or  decline compared to fiscal sales of computerized machine tools other than discontinued products declined million  or  compared to fiscal  reflecting the continuing global weakness in industrial equipment spending and reduced consumption of machine tools by many manufacturing companies  with the decline comprising million  million and  in the united states  europe and southeast asia  respectively 
non machine tool revenues also declined due to reduced activity levels in our market sectors  with the decline being most pronounced in the us the following table sets forth machine unit volume and average net selling price for computerized machine tools by continuing and discontinued products computerized machine tools units sold continuing products discontinued products total  average net selling price per unit in thousands continuing products discontinued products total the average net selling price per machine unit of continuing products increased due to the effect of stronger european currencies when translating foreign sales for financial reporting purposes which more than offset the effect of increased discounting due to weak market conditions 
new order bookings for continuing products in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
new orders for computerized machine tools other than discontinued products declined in us dollars worldwide 
the decline  which was experienced in all of our geographic markets  reflected a sharp decrease in orders for vertical machining centers  our primary product line 
backlog was million at october   compared to million at october  gross margin for fiscal  exclusive of inventory write downs recorded in cost of sales  declined to from in fiscal  due to the decline in our sales of vertical machining centers and our sale of approximately million in discontinued products at discounted prices 
gross margin did improve in the last three quarters of fiscal compared to the immediately preceding quarter  although the improvement was due primarily to the cost reductions implemented over the preceding eighteen months 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million were million  or  lower than those for fiscal  due to our cost reduction programs 
we expect operating expenses to be lower in as we experience a full year s benefit of cost reductions initiated in fiscal non operating items consisted of interest expense of  in fiscal  which was  or  lower than in fiscal  primarily due to reduced borrowings 
license fee income and litigation settlement fees in fiscal and consisted of several licenses that were granted during the year 
the licensing program that resulted in these fees was effectively completed in the first quarter of fiscal and we do not expect additional license fee income in the foreseeable future 
earnings from equity investments are from our two affiliates which are accounted for using the equity method 
other expense in fiscal was not significant and in fiscal  consisted primarily of the costs of typhoon related flood damage at our manufacturing facility in taiwan 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  exclusive of  restricted cash related to derivative instruments  compared to million at october  cash generated from operations totaled and million at october  and  respectively 
the weakening of the us dollar in relation to european currencies subsequent to october   will result in a temporary increase in restricted cash related to derivative instruments  pending the liquidation of forward contracts in the normal course during fiscal anticipated cash losses on these forward contracts will be funded by the increased us dollar value of the related inter company sales which are being hedged and  as a result  we do not expect cash flow from operations to be adversely affected 
working capital  excluding short term debt  was million at october   approximately the same as at october  cash flow from operations benefited million in fiscal from accelerated collections of accounts receivable and million from planned reductions of finished machines in inventory 
these amounts were substantially offset by reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses due principally to timing of payments related to prior year foreign taxes and other operating items 
we expect our operating working capital requirements to increase in fiscal  commensurate with any increase in sales and service fees 
any such increase will be funded by cash flow from operation and borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
capital investments during the year consisted of normal expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
we funded these expenditures with cash flow from operations 
on october   we issued a secured promissory note for million to the seller of certain patent rights as partial payment for the purchase of those rights 
the note had an interest rate of per annum and was payable in four quarterly installments of  the last of which was paid on december  effective december   we amended and restated our credit agreement with our domestic bank  which extended the maturity date to december  and increased the maximum amount of the facility from million to million 
the credit agreement provides the lender with a security interest in substantially all domestic assets  exclusive of the assets subject to the first mortgage  and of the common stock of our us holding companies  which own our foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings may be made in us dollars  euros or pounds sterling 
interest on all outstanding borrowings is payable at libor for the respective currency plus an applicable margin  or  at our option  prime rate plus a specified margin based on funded debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio  as follows total funded debt ebitda ratio libor margin prime margin greater than greater than and less than or equal to 
greater than and less than or equal to 
less than or equal to 
prior to march   the applicable margin is determined based on the total funded debt ebitda ratio being greater than and less than or equal to thereafter  the applicable margin will be adjusted on the first day of the month following the month after each quarter end 
availability under the facility is limited to the greater of the commitment or a borrowing base  as defined in the agreement  which measured as of october   aggregated million 
the agreement requires that we maintain consolidated net worth of million plus an amount equal to of positive consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended october   and for each fiscal year thereafter 
consolidated net worth is defined as total shareholders equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income 
our consolidated total debt as compared to consolidated total debt plus consolidated net worth ratio cannot be greater than to and our fixed charge coverage ratio cannot be less than to the fixed charge coverage ratio is the ratio of consolidated ebitda minus taxes  unfunded capital expenditures and redemptions of capital stock to principal payments of indebtedness plus consolidated interest expense 
effective january   we entered into an agreement with our principal domestic bank which provides our uk subsidiary with a revolving credit and overdraft facility 
the facility includes a maximum commitment aggregating pound million approximately million and matures january  borrowings will be secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of our uk subsidiary 
interest on outstanding borrowings will be based on libor for fixed rate loans and a base rate for overdrafts  in each case  plus a margin based on consolidated funded debt to ebitda equivalent to that of our domestic bank facility 
we have a million euro credit facility with a european bank 
on december   the maturity date of the facility was extended until november  interest on the facility is payable at per annum or  at our option  above euribor for fixed rate borrowings 
although the facility is uncollateralized  the bank reserves the right to require collateral in the event of increased risk evaluation 
borrowings outstanding under this facility at october  were million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we settled a disputed claim in the united kingdom regarding a terminated facility lease for million  which had been previously accrued 
the settlement payment was due in two equal installments  which where paid in the first quarter of fiscal the settlement payments were funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings available from bank credit facilities 
total debt at october  was million representing of total capitalization  compared to million  or of total capitalization  at october  we were in compliance with all loan covenants and had unused credit availability of million at october  we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings available to us under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal contractual obligations and commitments the following is a table of contractual obligations and commitments as of october  all amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt    operating leases    deferred credits and other total     in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed above  we also have a variety of other contractual agreements related to the procurement of materials and services and other commitments 
with respect to these agreements  we are not subject to any contracts which commit us to material non cancelable commitments 
while some of these contractual agreements are long term supply agreements  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements which are not needed to meet production needs 
we have no material minimum purchase commitments or take or pay type agreements or arrangements 
with respect to capital expenditures  we expect capital spending in fiscal  exclusive of capitalized software development costs  to approximate million  which includes discretionary items 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  our german subsidiary guarantees third party lease financing residuals in connection with the sale of certain machines in europe 
at october  there were third party guarantees totaling approximately million 
a retention of title clause allows our germany subsidiary to obtain the machine if the customer defaults on its lease 
we believe that the proceeds obtained from liquidation of the machine would cover any payments required under the guarantee 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies  including those described below  require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon delivery to the customer  which is normally at the time of shipment  because ownership and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time and payment terms are fixed 
our computerized machine tools are general purpose computer controlled machine tools that are typically used in stand alone operations 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss are not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance 
prior to shipment  we test each machine to ensure the machine s compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our sales literature 
depending upon geographic location  the machine installation at the end user may be completed by a distributor  independent contractor or hurco service technician 
in most instances where a machine is sold through a distributor  we have no installation involvement 
if sales are direct or through sales agents  we will typically complete the machine installation 
the machine installation consists of the reassembly of certain parts that were removed for shipping and the re testing of the machine to ensure that it is performing with the standard specifications 
we consider the machine installation process inconsequential and perfunctory 
service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a pro rata basis over the term of the contract 
sales related to software products are recognized when shipped in conformity with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition 
inventories we must determine at each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
reserves are established to effectively adjust any such inventory to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
deferred tax asset valuation as of october   we have deferred tax assets of million for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance  resulting in zero net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
these future tax benefits relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as federal business tax credits carried forward in the united states 
some of these carryforward benefits expire at certain dates and utilization of certain others is limited to specific amounts each year 
realization of those benefits is entirely dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable earnings in the specific tax jurisdictions before they expire 
due to the recent losses in the united states and the applicable foreign tax jurisdictions  there is uncertainty whether these tax benefits can be utilized before they expire 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance 
the need for this allowance is reviewed periodically  and if reduced in future periods  the associated tax benefits will be recorded in future operations as a reduction of income tax expense 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred to develop new computer software products and significant enhancements to software features of existing products are capitalized as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and amortized over the estimated product life of the related software 
the determination as to when in the product development cycle technological feasibility has been established  and the expected product life  require judgments and estimates by management and can be affected by technological developments  innovations by competitors and changes in market conditions affecting demand 
we capitalized  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal related to software development projects 
also in fiscal  we wrote off million of previously capitalized costs related to a discontinued product line 
at october  we have an asset of million for capitalized software development projects  a significant portion of which relates to projects currently in process and subject to development risk and market acceptance 
we periodically review the carrying values of these assets and make judgments as to ultimate realization considering the above mentioned risk factors 
derivative financial instruments critical aspects of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments include conditions which require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction 
another important element of the policy demands that formal documentation be maintained as required by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings 
we routinely monitor significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments associated with derivative instruments  and compliance with formal documentation requirements 
stock compensation we apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock based compensation  therefore  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options  except for certain shares subject to variable plan accounting  as options are granted at fair market value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation provides an alternative method of accounting for stock options based on an option pricing model  such as black scholes 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
information and assumptions regarding compensation expense under the alternative method is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest expense on our outstanding debt  all of which is subject to floating rates  either libor or prime 
if market interest rates on our outstanding variable rate borrowings were to have increased by one percentage point or basis points over the actual rates paid in that year  interest expense would have increased by  in fiscal and  in fiscal this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in other factors affecting our financial statements that might result from changes in the economic environment which impact interest rates 
note of the consolidated financial statements has a discussion of the interest rates related to our current credit facilities 
at october   outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facilities were million and our total indebtedness was million 
foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal  approximately of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all of our computerized machine tools and computer control systems  as well as certain proprietary service parts  are sourced by our us based engineering and manufacturing division and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  or overseas contract manufacturers 
these purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in some cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements  which reduce but do not eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs 
the predominant portion of our exchange rate risk associated with product purchases relates to the new taiwan dollar 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecast inter company sales  and forecast inter company and third party purchases denominated in  or based on  foreign currencies primarily the euro  pound sterling and new taiwan dollar 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of october  which are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
were as follows contract amount at forward weighted rates in notional amount avg 
us dollars forward in foreign forward contract october  maturity contracts currency rate date dates sale contracts euro    nov oct sterling    nov sept forward contracts for the sale of foreign currencies as of october  which were entered into to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies were as follows contract amount at forward weighted rates in notional amount avg
