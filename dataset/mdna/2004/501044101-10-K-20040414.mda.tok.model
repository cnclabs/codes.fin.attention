item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company the kroger co 
was founded in and incorporated in as of january   we were one of the largest grocery retailers in the united states based on annual sales 
we also manufacture and process food for sale in our supermarkets 
we employ approximately  full and part time employees 
our principal executive offices are located at vine street  cincinnati  ohio and our telephone number is we maintain a web site www 
kroger 
com which includes additional information about our company 
we make available through our web site  free of charge  our annual reports on form k  our quarterly reports on form q and our current reports on form k  including amendments thereto 
these forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them electronically with the sec 
our revenues are earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our supermarkets 
we earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of our costs to make these products available to our customers 
such costs include procurement and distribution costs  facility occupancy and operational costs  and overhead expenses 
our stores as of january   we operated  either directly or through our subsidiaries   supermarkets 
approximately of these supermarkets operated in company owned facilities 
as of january   of these supermarkets had fuel centers 
our current growth strategy emphasizes self development and ownership of store real estate 
our stores operate under several banners that have strong local ties and brand equity 
our supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats combination food and drug stores combo stores  multi department stores  or price impact warehouse stores 
the combo stores are our primary food store format 
they are typically able to earn a return above our cost of capital by drawing customers from a mile radius 
we believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one stop shopping  including whole health sections  pharmacies  general merchandise  pet centers and high quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce 
many combination stores include a fuel center 
multi department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores 
in addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store  multi department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel  home fashion and furnishings  electronics  automotive  toys and fine jewelry 
many multi department stores include a fuel center 
price impact warehouse stores offer a no frills  low cost warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items 
quality meat  dairy  baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage 
the average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store 
in addition to our supermarkets  we operate  either directly or through subsidiaries  convenience stores and fine jewelry stores 
our subsidiaries operated of the convenience stores  while were operated through franchise agreements 
approximately of the convenience stores operated by our subsidiaries were operated in company owned facilities 
the convenience stores offer a limited assortment of staple food items and general merchandise and  in most cases  sell gasoline 
merchandising and manufacturing corporate brand products play an important role in our merchandising strategy 
our supermarket divisions typically stock approximately  private label items 
our corporate brand products are produced and sold in three quality tiers 
private selection is the premium quality brand designed to meet or beat the gourmet or upscale national or regional brands 
the banner brand kroger  ralphs  king soopers  etc  which represents the majority of our private label items  is designed to be equal to or better than the national brand and carries the try it  like it  or get the national brand free guarantee 
fmv for maximum value is the value brand  designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price 
approximately of the corporate brand units sold are produced in our manufacturing plants  the remaining corporate brand items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers 
we perform a make or buy analysis on corporate brand products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market based transfer prices versus open market purchases 
as of january   we operated manufacturing plants 
these plants consisted of dairies  deli or bakery plants  five grocery product plants  three beverage plants  three meat plants and two cheese plants 
operating environment traditional grocery retailers  including kroger  have experienced significant business challenges in recent years 
consumers have remained cautious in their purchases amid concerns about the economy and high unemployment while competition has continued to intensify 
customers today have a larger number of stores and greater variety of retail formats from which to select 
these factors have placed pressure on retail prices 
additionally  our company  as well as several of our traditional competitors  has faced dramatic increases in certain operating costs  particularly labor and employee benefit costs in unionized markets 
our management team identified these trends more than two years ago and implemented strategic initiatives designed to control costs and offer better value to our customers 
we have made progress since that time 
we believe future industry consolidation is likely and presents opportunities for kroger to gain market share and improve financial results as weaker competitors decline in or exit markets and their sales base is picked up by their competitors 
kroger has a high quality asset base that holds the or market share in of our major markets with leading market share in many of the nation s largest and fastest growing markets 
we define a major market as one in which we operate nine or more stores 
according to our internal share estimates  kroger s share increased in of our major markets in on a volume weighted basis  kroger s market share was unchanged 
we are in a stronger financial and cash flow position than are many in our industry and  even at current earnings  we continue to earn more than our cost of capital  excluding the effect of labor disputes and the goodwill and asset impairment charges 
our plan  going forward  is to continue sharpening our focus on price and to make further reductions in operating costs 
we expect those reductions will fund a portion of our price investments 
our focus on operating costs will include those items traditionally recorded as operating  general and administrative og a expenses plus certain items included in merchandise costs 
this focus includes shrink  warehousing and transportation costs  and advertising costs 
rent expense and depreciation expense will be targeted for reduction as well 
further discussion on our industry  the current economic environment and our related strategic plans is included below in outlook 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and compared to comparability is affected by certain income and expense items that fluctuated significantly between and among the periods  including the goodwill and asset impairment charges 
these items are identified below in other items 
kroger s financial results were adversely affected by labor disputes in southern california and in the west virginia area 
these disputes  which are summarized below  adversely affected our sales  fifo gross margin as defined below and operating  general and administrative expenses 
our analysis includes estimates of the effects of these disputes on our results in these areas 
labor dispute summary southern california safeway inc  alberston s  inc 
and kroger  either directly or through their subsidiaries  collectively  the retailers were party to multi employer bargaining with various local unions affiliated with the united food and commercial workers international union ufcw collectively  the unions in southern california 
the retailers and the unions entered into agreements under which a strike against one employer would be deemed a strike against all employers 
in addition  the retailers entered into an agreement among themselves the agreement requiring  among other things  that if one employer were struck  the remaining employers would lock out bargaining unit employees 
the agreement was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others 
the agreement is more fully described below in other items 
on october   the unions initiated a strike against safeway  inc on october   the other retailers locked out the bargaining unit employees as required by the agreement 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  on february   the company announced that it was notified by the ufcw that a new labor contract had been ratified by union members  ending a day work stoppage 
labor dispute summary west virginia area on october   we temporarily closed kroger stores  primarily in west virginia  following a decision by a local union of the ufcw that represents workers in those stores to conduct a strike against kroger 
on december   kroger announced that union members had ratified a new labor contract covering employees in these stores 
we re opened of the stores on december  three stores were not re opened 
sales total sales were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
these sales represented annual increases of in and in total food store sales were billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
the differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions and sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 
we define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters 
we calculate annualized identical food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of identical sales 
our annualized identical food store sales results are summarized in the table below 
identical food store sales in millions excluding stores affected by labor disputes identical food store sales percentage difference we define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations 
we calculated annualized comparable food store sales based on a summation of four quarters of comparable sales 
our annualized comparable food store sales results are summarized in the table below 
comparable food store sales in millions excluding stores affected by labor disputes comparable food store sales percentage difference the labor disputes affected our sales results in several ways 
in the west virginia area  we temporarily closed stores in response to a decision by a local union to conduct a strike against kroger 
our pharmacies in the area remained open 
as a result  we did not realize any sales other than pharmacy sales at these stores for approximately two months of in southern california  sales results were negatively affected by picket lines established outside of our ralphs stores 
picket lines generally dissuade potential customers from entering our stores 
additionally  we were forced to hire temporary employees and transfer current employees from other areas to southern california to staff the stores 
operating with fewer employees and  in most cases  less experienced replacement employees  our stores suffered sales losses due to increased inventory shortages  decreased customer service and the closure of selected service departments 
these negative sales effects were partially offset by sales increases at our food less stores in the region that were not involved in the labor dispute 
also  sales at ralphs stores were favorably affected during those weeks when picket lines were removed from ralphs stores 
sales figures adjusted for effects of the labor disputes exclude stores involved in labor disputes  as well as food less stores whose sales results were favorably affected by the labor disputes in that region 
sales were excluded for the last four weeks of our third quarters and the first six weeks of our fourth quarters for stores in the west virginia area 
sales were excluded for the last five weeks of our third quarters and for our entire fourth quarters for the ralphs and food less stores 
our sales in were also affected by inflation and deflation in various commodity groups  the weak economy  increased competition and the results of our strategic initiatives 
the estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in impact of inflation 
fifo gross margin we calculate first in  first out fifo gross margin as follows sales minus merchandise costs plus last in  first out lifo charge credit 
merchandise costs include advertising  warehousing and transportation  but exclude depreciation expense and rent expense 
fifo gross margin is an important measure used by our management to evaluate merchandising and operational effectiveness 
our fifo gross margin rates were  and in  and  respectively 
these declining rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices 
the effect of our investment in lower retail prices was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities 
improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our fifo gross margin rates in  and because those products carry a higher margin than national brand products 
other items recorded as merchandise costs in and further affected our fifo gross margin rates 
these items  which include estimates of the effects of the labor disputes  are described below in other items 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses  which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs  as a percent of sales were  and in  and  respectively 
og a expenses for were affected by the labor disputes and several items that are more fully described below in other items 
in addition to those items  our og a expense rate in was adversely affected by higher health care benefit and pension costs 
a portion of the decrease in our rate in versus was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives associated with the strategic growth plan that we announced in december our og a rate declined in despite increases in our health care benefit costs  pension costs and credit card fees 
rent expense rent expense  as a percent of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in these rates reflect our current strategy on ownership of real estate 
depreciation expense depreciation expense  as a percent of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to kroger s capital investment program and the ownership of real estate 
goodwill amortization in  goodwill amortization expense totaled million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which became effective for kroger on february   goodwill was not amortized beginning in goodwill impairment charge our annual impairment review performed during the fourth quarter of resulted in a goodwill impairment charge related to our smith s division totaling million 
details of the charge are included in other items 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges totaling million and million were recorded during and the impairments represented write downs of under performing stores to estimated fair market values 
the impairment charges are explained more fully in other items 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in primarily resulted from lower average borrowings in compared to the decrease in  when compared to  resulted from lower interest rates on our floating rate debt in versus interest expense in and included million and million  respectively  due to the early retirement of debt 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and in  and the effective rates for and differ from the effective rate for due to the impairment of non deductible goodwill in and the amortization of goodwill in the effective income tax rates also differ from the expected statutory rate in all years presented due to the effect of state taxes 
net earnings net earnings totaled million  or per diluted share  in these results represent a decrease of approximately from net earnings of per diluted share for the decrease in net earnings was affected significantly by the labor disputes  impairment charges and several other items that are described below in other items 
net earnings of per diluted share for represented an increase of approximately over net earnings of per diluted share for adjusting results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect  as illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements  net earnings would have been per diluted share in adjusting the results for the cumulative effect of the accounting change  net earnings would have been in on this basis  net earnings of per diluted share for represented an increase of approximately over net earnings of per diluted share for other items the following table summarizes items that affected kroger s financial results during the periods presented 
these items should not be considered alternatives to net earnings  net cash provided by operating activities or any other generally accepted accounting principle gaap measure of performance or liquidity 
these items should not be viewed in isolation or considered substitutes for kroger s results as reported in accordance with gaap 
due to the nature of these items  as described below  it is important to identify these items and review them in conjunction with kroger s financial results reported in accordance with gaap 
these items include a goodwill impairment charge  asset impairment charges  restructuring charges  merger related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change  all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statement of earnings 
the items also include charges and credits that were recorded as components of fifo gross margin  lifo charge credit  og a expense and interest expense 
additionally  items in included the estimated effects of the labor disputes

income tax benefits in and are affected by the non deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge and goodwill amortization charges 
the transitional impairment review required by the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets resulted in a write off of our jewelry store division goodwill 
items affecting fifo gross margin  lifo charge credit and operating  general and administrative expense estimated effect of labor disputes for dispute affected regions  we assumed that trends existing prior to the effect of the labor disputes would have continued 
based on those trends  the estimated effects included the differences between reported sales and sales projections less reported merchandising costs and merchandising cost projections and the differences between reported og a and og a projections 
the estimates included differences at strike affected stores as well as differences at food less stores in southern california whose financial results were affected by the labor dispute 
differences affecting fifo gross margin included incremental warehousing  distribution  advertising and inventory shrinkage expenses due to the labor disputes 
differences in og a included direct pre strike expenses  costs associated with hiring and training replacement workers  costs associated with bringing in employees from other kroger divisions to work on a temporary basis in the ralphs stores and expenses under the agreement 
as described above in results of operations  the agreement entered into in connection with the multi employer collective bargaining arrangement among the retailers was designed to prevent the unions from placing disproportionate pressure on one or more of the retailers by picketing one or more of the retailers but not the others 
the agreement provided for payments from any of the retailers who gained from such disproportionate pressure to any of the retailers who suffered from such disproportionate pressure  based on a percentage of the sales deemed caused by the disproportionate pressure 
expenses related to the agreement were recorded as og a and totaled approximately million  pre tax  in fiscal amounts will be paid under the agreement in the first quarter of furthermore  changes in our obligations for health care in the new labor agreement triggered an obligation under our previous southern california labor contract that required us to make a contribution of approximately million  pre tax  to the union s health and welfare trust fund 
expenses related to this contribution were recorded as og a in fiscal the new labor contract also provides for a contract ratification bonus to be paid by the retailers 
our expenses related to this ratification bonus will be recorded as og a in both our contribution to the trust fund and the ratification bonus were paid in the first quarter of item cost conversion in  prior to the merger with fred meyer  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method 
the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimating inherent in the retail method 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the item cost method for the former fred meyer divisions 
the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february   cannot be determined 
the effect of the change on the february  inventory valuation  which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods  was included in results for the quarter ended may  this change increased merchandise costs by million and reduced net earnings by million 
we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because we were unable to determine cost information for these periods 
the item cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on february  adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
we adopted eitf issue no 
during the fourth quarter of this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
historically  we had recognized those allowances as they were earned  based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract 
this accounting treatment was consistent with gaap 
for all contracts entered into or modified after january   we have recognized prospectively  and will continue to recognize  vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold  in accordance with issue net earnings in were not affected by the adoption of issue no 
adoption of the issue resulted in a million pre tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in this expense was offset by a corresponding million pre tax lifo credit that also was included in merchandise costs in lease liabilities store closing plans in connection with the asset impairment review described below  we recorded pre tax og a expenses of million in for the present value of lease liabilities for the leased stores identified for closure 
in  we also recorded pre tax expenses of million for the present value of lease liabilities for similar store closings 
the liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the fred meyer merger  or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger  that were identified as under performing stores 
in both years  liabilities were recorded for the planned closings of the stores 
due to operational changes  performance improved at five stores that had not yet closed 
as a result of this improved performance  in the first quarter of we modified our original plans and determined that these five locations will remain open 
additionally  closing and exit costs at other locations included in the original plans were less costly than anticipated 
in total  in the first quarter of  we recorded pre tax income of million to adjust these liabilities to reflect the outstanding lease commitments through at the locations remaining under the plans 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 
no charges were recorded in for the present value of lease liabilities for stores considered in the asset impairment review 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which is effective for all exit and disposal activities initiated after december   these liabilities will be recorded when these locations are closed 
most of the locations are expected to close during as a result  we expect to record pre tax charges totaling approximately million to million during excess energy purchase commitments during the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity 
sfas no 
required the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through current period earnings each quarter 
we recorded pre tax expense of million and pre tax income of million as a result of the market value adjustment of these excess commitments in and  respectively 
market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements in california with dynegy  inc  related to these two contracts and two other electricity contracts that had been previously accounted for as normal purchases normal sales contracts 
the federal energy regulatory commission approved the agreement on july  during the third quarter of  we paid million  before the related tax benefits  to settle disputes with dynegy related to prior over payments  terminate two of the four contracts effective july   and terminate the remaining two agreements effective september  as a result of the settlement  we recorded million of pre tax expense in the second quarter of property tax allowance in the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax income of million related to the reversal of a property tax accrual 
we have determined the amount to be paid will be less than we originally estimated 
power outage in the second quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax expense for the august power outage in northwest ohio and michigan 
the majority of the expense related to uninsured product losses 
generally  we classify uninsured product and property losses as og a expense 
adjustment to charitable contribution liability in the second quarter of  we recorded million of pre tax income to adjust previously recorded liabilities related to charitable contributions required as a result of the fred meyer merger 
we are required to make these contributions by may items affecting interest expense we adopted sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  in the first quarter of as a result  expenses related to the early retirement of debt  which were recorded as extraordinary items prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 are now classified as interest expense in the respective periods 
the expenses of million  pre tax  related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of million of long term bonds  and the write off of the related deferred financing costs 
goodwill impairment charge we performed the annual evaluation of goodwill required by sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of this review resulted in a million non cash impairment charge related to the goodwill at our smith s division 
the impairment charge  which is non deductible for income tax purposes  adjusted the carrying value of the division s goodwill to its implied fair value 
in  the smith s division experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared with results and budgeted results 
additionally  we have forecasted a further decline in the future operating performance of this division 
the decline in expected performance reflects both investments in capital and targeted retail price reductions intended to maintain and grow market share and provide acceptable long term return on capital 
no impairment was indicated during this review for goodwill at our other divisions 
asset impairment charges and related items in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets  we identified impairment losses for both assets to be disposed of and assets to be held and used during and these losses  which are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges  totaled million and million  pre tax  in and  respectively 
in both years  the impairment reviews were conducted as a consequence of a corporate level strategic plan that coordinated the closings of several locations over a relatively short period of time 
the charge related to investments by acquired companies in stores opened shortly after the fred meyer merger that did not perform as expected during and based on those results and forecasts for and beyond  we performed an impairment review in the third quarter of that resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
the charge related to locations whose operating performance deteriorated subsequent to the review 
during the fourth quarter of  we authorized closure of several stores throughout the country based on results for and  as well as updated projections for and beyond 
this event triggered an impairment review of stores slated for closure as well as several other under performing locations in the fourth quarter of the review resulted in a pre tax charge totaling million 
these charges are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges on december   we outlined our strategic growth plan to support additional investment in our core business to increase sales and market share 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million primarily for severance agreements associated with the plan 
restructuring charges related to the plan totaled million  pre tax  in the majority of the expenses related to severance agreements  distribution center consolidation and conversion costs 
no restructuring charges were recorded in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 
merger related costs during and  we recorded  pre tax expenses of million and million  respectively  from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments 
the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger 
no merger related costs were recorded in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 
cumulative effect of an accounting change as noted above in results of operations  we adopted sfas no 
on february  the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 
resulted in a million pre tax non cash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value 
impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis  rather than on an undiscounted basis  as was the standard under sfas no 
 prior to adoption of sfas no 
we recorded this loss as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of a million tax benefit  in the first quarter of common stock repurchase program in december of  we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  including the tax benefit of these exercises 
on march   our board authorized the repurchase of an incremental billion of kroger common stock 
during fiscal  we made open market purchases of million under the billion authorization and million under previous board authorizations 
during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million to complete the billion program 
effective december   the board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling million 
we made open market purchases of million and million under this plan in and  respectively 
as of april   we have repurchased approximately million under this program in fiscal we also reacquired approximately million  million and million under the stock option program in fiscal  and  respectively 
purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 
capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in most amounts were used to construct new stores 
capital expenditures included million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage supermarket storing activity beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
the liabilities represent our best estimate  using generally accepted actuarial reserving methods  of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred but not reported for all claims incurred through january  case reserves are established for reported claims using case basis evaluation of the underlying claim data and are updated as more information becomes known 
the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis 
the difference between the discounted and undiscounted workers compensation liabilities was million as of january  we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether certain trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset s current carrying value 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
the factors that most significantly affect the impairment calculation are our estimates of future cash flows 
our cash flow projections project several years into the future and include assumptions on variables such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
we perform impairment reviews at both the division and corporate levels 
generally  for reviews performed by local management  costs to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as operating  general and administrative expense 
cost to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that result from corporate level strategic plans are separately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges 
refer to other items for a description of asset impairment charges recorded during and goodwill goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of trigger events 
the reviews are performed at the operating division level 
generally  fair value represents a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
if potential for impairment is identified  the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
results of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
similar to our policy on impairment of long lived assets  the cash flow projections embedded in our goodwill impairment reviews can be affected by several items such as inflation  the economy and market competition 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant income and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
however  the ultimate cost of the disposition of the leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates and general economic conditions 
owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
costs to reduce the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are accounted for in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in merchandise costs 
cost to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the discount rate is based primarily on the yield on high quality fixed income investments as of the measurement date 
we lowered the discount rate to as of january   from as of february  the basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the projected pension benefit obligation as of january   by million 
in  we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by million as a result of this change 
to determine the expected return on pension plan assets  we contemplate current and forecasted plan asset allocations as well as historical and forecasted returns on various asset categories 
we reduced the pension return assumption to for from for our pension plan s average return for the calendar years ended december   was  net of all investment management fees and expenses 
we believe the reduction in the pension return assumption was appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return 
we estimate that our pension expense increased approximately million as a result of the reduction in expected return from to 
on february   we made a cash contribution of million to our pension plans 
we are required to make a cash contribution of million by september   and we intend to contribute an additional million by september  we expect the additional contributions made during will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years 
among other things  performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
we also participate in various multi employer plans for substantially all employees represented by unions 
we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded 
benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of service 
we contributed million  million and million to these funds in fiscal  and  respectively 
we would have contributed an additional million to these plans in had there been no labor disputes 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans  coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided  has led to the underfunding 
as a result  we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges 
two recently completed labor negotiations  including southern california  resulted in a reduction of liabilities and  therefore  expected contribution increases 
these multi employer funds are managed by trustees  appointed by management of the employers including kroger and labor in equal number  who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently 
thus  while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years  the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining  actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds 
for these reasons  it is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multi employer pension contributions will increase 
moreover  if we were to exit markets  we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability 
any adjustments for withdrawal liability will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 
stock option plans we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date  no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings  other than expenses related to restricted stock awards 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards  consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories for and approximately of inventories for were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at january   and by million at february  we follow the link chain  dollar value lifo method for purposes of calculating our lifo charge or credit 
the item cost method of accounting is followed for substantially all non perishable store inventories at our supermarket divisions 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the methodology followed under the retail method of accounting 
we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of recent physical counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the balance sheet date 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information net cash provided by operating activities we generated  million of cash from operations in compared to  million in and  million in lower earnings  including the effect of labor disputes  contributed to the decrease in cash provided in when compared to conversely  increased earnings contributed to the increase in cash provided in when compared to changes in our operating assets and liabilities also affect the net amount of cash provided by our operating activities 
during  we realized a million increase in operating assets and liabilities compared to a million reduction during and a million increase during fluctuations in our accounts payable balances contributed to the changes in operating assets and liabilities in and in  our accounts payable balances increased substantially due to an enterprise systems conversion that enabled our western divisions to improve their accounts payable position 
the decrease in our accounts payable balances in was primarily related to our decision to discontinue the practice of transferring deposits to our concentration account prior to receiving credit for those deposits from other banks 
the cost of this activity was minimal in expected increases in bank fees made the activity non economical in offsetting the changes in our accounts payable balances  our other current liabilities increased in as a result of the labor disputes discussed in other items 
the amount of cash paid for income taxes in and was lower than the amount paid in due  in part  to a tax law benefit that will continue through under current tax law  the bonus depreciation provision will expire in december and we expect the cash benefit will begin to reverse in this provision reduced our cash taxes by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our operating cash flow results also reflect a million cash contribution to our company sponsored pension plan 
net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities was  million in  compared to  million in and  million in the amount of cash used by investing activities in  and was relatively consistent among the years due to similar levels of capital spending  including acquisitions 
net cash used by financing activities financing activities used million of cash in  compared to  million in and million in the decrease in the use of cash in versus was due primarily to a reduction in the amount of cash used to reduce our outstanding debt and to a reduction in treasury stock purchases 
the decreased use of cash was also due to increases in book overdrafts in versus as well as to proceeds received in from interest rate swap terminations 
the increase in the use of cash in versus was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in versus debt management total debt  including both the current and long term portions of capital leases  decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end total debt decreased million to billion as of year end from billion as of year end the decreases in and resulted  in part  from the use of cash flow from operations to reduce outstanding debt 
approximately million of the decrease experienced in resulted from the consolidation of a financing entity 
in prior years  we purchased a portion of the debt issued by a mortgagor of certain of our properties to reduce our effective interest expense 
historically  these purchases were classified as investments on our balance sheet 
these purchases totaled million as of year end and million as of year end during the fourth quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  for this entity and determined that it was required to be consolidated 
consolidation reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately million 
refer to recently issued accounting standards for further details 
our total debt balances were also affected by our prefunding of employee benefit costs and by the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt  pursuant to sfas no 
we had prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end and and million at year end the mark to market adjustments increased the carrying value of our debt by million as of year end and by million as of year end the mark to market adjustments reduced the carrying value of our debt by million as of year end factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately million to million under our a f rated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities 
we have capacity available under our credit facilities to backstop all cp amounts outstanding 
if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbb bbb baa  the ability to borrow under our current cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating 
this could require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program  depending on the current interest rate environment 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie  in excess of days 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected by a decrease in our credit rating or a decrease in our applicable percentage ratio 
our credit facilities also require the maintenance of a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio our financial covenants 
a failure to maintain our financial covenants would impair our ability to borrow under the credit facilities 
these financial covenants and ratios are described below our applicable percentage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated total interest expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio declined to below to  the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would increase at least 
the cost of our borrowings under the credit facilities would be similarly impacted by a one level downgrade in our credit rating 
our leverage ratio the ratio of net debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio exceeded to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
our fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated ebitda plus consolidated rental expense to consolidated cash interest expense plus consolidated rental expense  as defined in the credit facilities was to as of january  if this ratio fell below to  we would be in default of our credit facilities and our ability to borrow under these facilities would be impaired 
consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit facilities includes an adjustment for unusual gains and losses 
our credit agreements are more particularly described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants at year end the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations  net of interest operating lease obligations charitable contributions projected contributions to company sponsored pension plan southern california labor disputes construction commitments purchase obligations other commercial commitments credit facilities standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees these borrowings also are included in the long term debt contractual obligation amounts 
we are required to make a cash contribution of million to our company sponsored pension plan by september   and we intend to contribute an additional million by september  we expect the additional contributions made during will reduce our minimum required contributions in future years 
amounts shown in the table for and assume that we contribute million by september  if we contribute only million by september   our minimum required contributions would be million in and million in among other things  performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
at this time  it is not reasonably practicable to estimate contribution amounts for and beyond 
as described in other items  we expect to make payments of at least million in related to the settlement of the labor dispute in southern california 
additional amounts will be due for activity 
our construction commitments include capital owed to third parties for projects currently under construction 
these amounts are reflected in accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets 
our purchase obligations include commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
our obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
any upfront vendor allowances or incentives associated with outstanding purchase commitments are recorded as either current or long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of january   we had an million five year credit agreement  a million five year credit agreement and a  million day credit agreement 
the million five year facility terminates on may   unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger 
the million five year facility terminates on may   unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger 
the day facility terminates on may   unless extended  converted into a one year term loan  or earlier terminated by kroger 
at january   we also maintained a million money market line 
in addition to credit agreement borrowings  borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under our credit agreements 
at january   these letters of credit totaled million 
we had no borrowings under the money market line at january  the credit agreement borrowings have been classified as long term borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of facilities 
we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis  and have presented the amounts accordingly 
the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 
at january   we also had a million pharmacy receivable securitization facility that provided capacity incremental to the billion described above 
funds received under this million facility do not reduce funds available under the credit facilities 
collection rights to some of our pharmacy accounts receivable balances are sold to initiate the drawing of funds under the facility 
as of january   we had no borrowings under this additional million facility 
in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of january   we had available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june   as amended in a filing made on july   and declared effective on july  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures  and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs 
however  we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of its subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with ownership 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss  should the partnerships be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of january   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we have also guaranteed approximately million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership 
we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in at february   we were a party to a financing transaction related to properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately million 
under the terms of the financing transaction  which was structured as a synthetic lease  a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of kroger 
the lease had a term of five years  which expired on february  the owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment 
the transaction  therefore  was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense 
kroger purchased the assets for total costs of million when the lease expired 
we are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to satisfy obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
impact of inflation while we believe that kroger s sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation  it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences 
in  we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of compared to product cost deflation of in we recorded a pre tax lifo charge of million in compared to a pre tax lifo credit of million in  including a million pre tax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of eitf in the fourth quarter of recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits was revised by the fasb in december the revised statement requires new annual disclosures about the types of plan assets  investment strategy  measurement date  plan obligations and cash flows as well as components of the net periodic benefit cost recognized in interim periods 
the new annual disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december   except for the disclosure of expected future benefit payment  which must be disclosed for fiscal years ending after june  interim period disclosures are generally effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have included the disclosures required by sfas no 
in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 asset retirement obligations  was issued by the fasb in august of this standard addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
became effective for kroger on february  adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  was issued by the fasb in april of sfas no 
became effective for kroger on february  this statement eliminates the requirement that gains and losses due to the extinguishment of debt be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
adoption of sfas no 
required us to reclassify the debt extinguishments recorded as extraordinary items in as interest expense in the respective periods 
these debt extinguishments were recorded during the first two quarters of and totaled million of pre tax expense 
pre tax expense totaling million related to premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of million of long term bonds  and the write off of the related deferred financing costs  was recorded in fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued by the fasb in january and revised in december fin provides guidance relating to the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities  as defined in the interpretation 
fin is effective for all variable interest entities created after january  for any variable interest entities created prior to february   fin became effective on february   the beginning of our first quarter of  unless earlier adopted  except for entities designated as special purpose entities for which the effective date was the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we adopted fin for a mortgagor the mortgagor of certain of our properties 
in prior years  we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the mortgagor to reduce our effective interest expense 
these purchases were classified as investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
consolidation of the mortgagor reduced both our investments and total debt by approximately million 
consolidation of the mortgagor had an immaterial effect on our consolidated statements of earnings and consolidated statements of cash flows 
we continue to review our partnerships  joint ventures and other financing arrangements for potential consolidation under this interpretation 
if we are required to consolidate any other entities in the first quarter of  we anticipate that such consolidation will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 
eitf issue no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers  was issued in november eitf issue no 
addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers  including manufacturer coupons 
eitf issue no 
became effective for kroger on february   the beginning of our first quarter of we believe the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have an immaterial effect on our financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  was issued by the fasb in january sfas no 
allows for a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of prescription drug act 
the prescription drug act  which was signed into law in december  in addition to creating a federal prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d  provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans which provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the prescription drug act introduces two new programs to medicare  a subsidy to plan sponsors based on of an individual beneficiary s annual prescription drug costs between and  and a option for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefit under medicare  that must be taken into consideration when measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit 
sfas no 
does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effect of the prescription drug act in its financial statements 
we have elected to defer adoption of sfas no 
due to a lack of specific guidance 
as such  the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the impact on the plans of the prescription drug act 
until further specific guidance is provided  we will continue to defer adoption of sfas no 
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and  when issued  may require information previously reported in our consolidated financial statements to change 
we will continue to investigate the impact of sfas no 
initial recognition  measurement and disclosure requirements on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
outlook this discussion and analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected change in net earnings  identical sales growth  expected pension plan contributions  our ability to generate operating cash flow  projected capital expenditures  square footage growth  opportunities to reduce costs  cash flow requirements  and our operating plan for the future  and are indicated by words or phrases such as comfortable  committed  expect  goal  should  target  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
we obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
we expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  natural food markets  supermarket fuel centers  seafood shops  floral shops  and bakeries 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
we expect identical food store sales for  excluding fuel  to be stronger than our fourth quarter of results of  excluding stores affected by labor disputes 
this assumes the economic and competitive environment will remain unchanged 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology focused on improved store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  should reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
capital spending for fiscal was billion  including acquisitions and the purchase of assets financed under the synthetic lease at february  we intend to use the combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements 
if determined preferable  we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities  entering into sale leaseback transactions  or by issuing additional debt or equity 
we expect capital investment for to be in the range of billion  excluding acquisitions 
total food store square footage is expected to grow before acquisitions and operational closings 
based on current operating results  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect that our og a results will be affected by increased costs  such as health care benefit costs  pension costs  utility costs and credit card fees  as well as any future labor disputes 
we expect earnings in to be lower than in  excluding the effect of the labor dispute and unusual items 
it is not possible for kroger to provide a more precise earnings estimate for because of the inherent uncertainties in the cost of the labor dispute in southern california  the time and investment needed to rebuild our business in the affected areas  and the investment necessary to meet kroger s plan to drive sales growth 
we plan to continue using one third of cash flow for debt reduction and two thirds for stock repurchase or payment of a cash dividend 
we have achieved significant cost savings over the past two years 
we believe that in there will be additional opportunities to reduce our operating costs in areas such as administration  labor  shrink  warehousing and transportation 
these savings will be invested in our core business to drive profitable sales growth and offer improved value and shopping experiences for our customers 
in addition to the million contributed during the first quarter of  we expect to make cash contributions to the company sponsored pension plans in the current and upcoming years 
we are required to make a cash contribution of million by september  we intend to contribute an additional million by september  we expect the additional contributions made during will reduce our contributions in future years 
among other things  performance of plan assets  the interest rates required to be used to calculate the pension obligations  and future changes in legislation  will determine the amounts of any additional contributions 
in addition to the company sponsored pension plans  we also participate in various multi employer pension plans for substantially all employees represented by unions 
we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded 
benefits are generally based on a fixed amount for each year of service 
we contributed million  million and million to these funds in  and  respectively 
we would have contributed an additional million to these plans in had there been no labor disputes 
based on the most recent information available to us  we believe these multi employer plans are underfunded 
the decline in the value of assets held in the funds supporting these plans  coupled with the high level of benefits generally provided  has led to the underfunding 
as a result  we expect that contributions to these plans will continue to increase and the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges 
two recently completed labor negotiations  including southern california  resulted in a reduction of liabilities and  therefore  expected contribution increases 
these multi employer funds are managed by trustees  appointed by management of the employers including kroger and labor in equal number  who have fiduciary obligations to act prudently 
thus  while we expect contributions to these funds to continue to increase as they have in recent years  the amount of increase will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining  actions taken by trustees and the actual return on assets held in these funds 
for these reasons  it is not practicable to determine the amount by which our multi employer pension contributions will increase 
moreover  if we were to exit markets  we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability 
any adjustments for withdrawal liability well be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include we currently have contract extensions in arizona  a portion of indiana  houston  louisville and food less in southern california 
those extensions are subject to termination by either party following notice 
we are actively pursuing negotiation of new agreements in those areas 
we remain hopeful  but cannot be certain  that we can reach satisfactory agreements without work stoppages in those markets 
in  we have major contracts expiring in seattle  nashville  detroit  denver  las vegas  and cincinnati 
in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on our results 
our ability to achieve sales and earnings goals will be affected by labor disputes  industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including the inflationary and deflationary trends in certain commodities  stock repurchases and the success of our future growth plans 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the impact of sister stores  and reductions in retail pricing 
kroger s eps growth goals could be affected by recessionary trends in the economy  our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified  including those to reduce shrink and og a  continued increases in health care  pension and credit card fees  and the success of our capital investments 
our ability to achieve our cost savings goals could be affected by our ability to achieve productivity improvements and shrink reduction  the impact of current or future labor disputes  efficiencies in our distribution centers and those created by our logistics projects  and competitive activity in the marketplace in which we operate 
the amount of contributions made to our pension and multi employer plans will be affected by the performance of investments made by the plans as well as the extent to which trustees of the plans reduce the costs of future service benefits 
we have estimated our exposure to the claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business and believe we have made adequate provisions for them 
unexpected outcomes in these matters could result in an adverse effect on our earnings 
the proportion of cash flow used to reduce outstanding debt  repurchase common stock  or pay a cash dividend may be affected by the market price of kroger common stock  the amount of outstanding debt available for pre payment and changes in borrowing rates 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
the results of our future growth plans  including the amount and timing of cost savings expected  could be adversely affected due to pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional retailers  our response actions  the state of the economy  including deflationary trends in certain commodities  recessionary times in the economy  our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified  including those to reduce shrink and operating  general and administrative expense  increase in health care  pension and credit card fees  and the success of our capital investments 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future asset write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed 
the grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and to reduce operating expenses  including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained  profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could adversely affect our sales 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth  and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate  may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers 
since gasoline generates low profit margins but significant sales  we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline 
although this negatively affects our gross profit margin  gasoline provides a positive effect on operating  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired  and achieve operating improvements at those companies  will affect our operations 
our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted  or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass on these increases to our customers  our gross margin and net earnings will suffer 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of changes in economic conditions on kroger s business 
we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of january   we maintained interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling approximately  million  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
these agreements mature at varying times between march and march variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar london interbank offered rate libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 
during  we terminated six interest rate swap agreements that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
approximately million of proceeds received as a result of these terminations were recorded as adjustments to the carrying values of the underlying debt and are being amortized over the remaining lives of the debt 
as of january   the unamortized balances totaled approximately we also initiated new interest rate swap agreements during that are being accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of january   assets totaling million were recorded to reflect the fair value of these new agreements  offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying debt 
as of january   we also maintained one interest rate swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates 
the agreement  which matured in february  involved the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the variable rate for this agreement was based on us dollar libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received was accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreement and recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
this agreement was accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of january  the amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of january  interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of january  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of january  refer to notes  and to the consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
as noted above in other items  we recorded a pre tax loss of million in the third quarter of to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases normal sales exception 
we marked the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis through june during the second quarter of  we reached an agreement through which we ended supply arrangements related to these contracts
