item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report for more information 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent highlights revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion 
the following recent developments during fiscal were key for our business strong cdma market growth throughout the world drove demand for our products and the products of our licensees 
enhanced multimedia functionality  increased growth of xev do  local number portability initiatives and improving competitive positioning of cdma operators drove worldwide growth in cdma phone sales 
introduction of new cdma networks in developing regions  as well as continued growth of networks in china and india  also contributed to growth in cdma sales 
worldwide  xev do grew to over nine million subscribers in september during fiscal  we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for mobile cdma phones and data modules  nearly all of which were third generation g  including cdma x  xev do and wcdma 
by calendar year end  operators are expected to have launched wcdma networks as reported by gsma gsm association 
wcdma subscriber growth in japan and europe  and new network launches in europe and asia drove growth in wcdma phone sales during fiscal thirteen subscriber licensees and eleven infrastructure licensees reported sales of wcdma products in the fourth quarter of fiscal wcdma royalties grew from of royalties reported in the first fiscal quarter of for licensee sales during the fourth fiscal quarter of to of royalties reported in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal for licensee sales during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal currently  average wcdma phone prices are significantly higher than worldwide average cdma phone prices 
during fiscal  several leading manufacturers announced the selection of our wcdma msm integrated circuits for their wcdma phone products  including siemens  samsung  lg electronics  sanyo and option 
as a result of record demand for cdma products  our integrated circuits business continued to experience supply constraints which resulted in our inability to meet certain customer demands 
to enable better supply of integrated circuit products  we have increased and extended firm orders to our foundry suppliers and are working with them to increase capacity 
we are also evaluating potential new suppliers to augment our future needs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to the global growth of wcdma networks and the increasing variability of our licensees market shares due to greater global competition  we would begin to recognize royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter  rather than continuing to estimate royalty revenues earned from certain licensees in advance of receiving their royalty reports 
accordingly  we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and royalties recorded as revenue for fiscal do not reflect an entire year s worth of royalties some royalties reported in the first quarter of fiscal were recorded based on estimates as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  from services and related hardware sales and from software development and related services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development  selling  general and administrative  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  asset impairment charges and other expenses 

table of contents we conduct business through four operating segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning 
qct s integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless phones and infrastructure equipment 
the wireless phone integrated circuits include the mobile station modem msm  radio frequency rf and power management pm devices 
the wireless phone integrated circuits and software perform voice and data communication  multimedia and global positioning functions  radio conversion between radio and baseband signals and power management 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits provide the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the operator s equipment 
qct software products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality imbedded in our integrated circuit products 
qct revenues comprised of total consolidated revenues in both fiscal and and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal qtl grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma including  without limitation  cdmaone  cdma x xev do xev dv  td scdma and wcdma products 
qtl receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our intellectual property 
qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qwi  which includes qualcomm wireless business solutions qwbs  qualcomm internet services qis and qualcomm government technologies qgov  generates revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services  software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qwbs provides satellite and terrestrial based two way data messaging and position reporting services to transportation companies  private fleets  construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies 
qis provides the brew product and services for the development and over the air deployment of data services on wireless devices 
qis also provides qchat and qpoint products and services 
qchat enables virtually instantaneous push to chat functionality on cdma based wireless devices while qpoint enables operators to offer e and location based applications and services 
the qgov division provides development  hardware and analytical expertise to united states government agencies involving wireless communications technologies 
the qgov division included the former digital cinema business prior to june in june  we were notified that a competing digital cinema compression technology was selected by the motion picture studio consortium tasked with technology selection for digital cinema applications 
as such  we are no longer pursuing the digital cinema business 
revenues from the digital cinema business were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
our strategy is to invest in cdma operators  licensed device manufacturers and start up companies that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess unique capabilities or technology to promote internet data communications 
effective as of the beginning of fiscal  we expect to present the operating results of our wireless multimedia us operator in the qsi segment 
looking forward in fiscal year  we expect continued growth in the overall cdma and wcdma market  with particularly strong growth in wcdma and emerging cdma markets 
we expect continued growth in xev do in south korea  japan and latin america  as well as north america  with expected launches of nationwide service by both verizon wireless and sprint pcs 
the global expansion of broadband data services is expected to continue to drive demand for both xev do phones and data cards for laptop services 
operator competition in japan  north america and other regions is also accelerating data strategies and services as one operator responds to the plans of another 
as reported by mobilemonday 
net  a community of and for mobile professionals  operators are expected to have launched wcdma networks by the end of calendar  which is expected to drive meaningful growth in wcdma phone sales during fiscal year cingular wireless in north america is looking to launch wcdma hsdpa later in we anticipate g wireless licenses will be granted in china in calendar when the licenses are granted  we expect operators in china will be authorized to upgrade and deploy third 
table of contents generation cdma based networks 
we also expect additional cdma network launches in fiscal to contribute to growth 
we believe our qct business will increasingly benefit from strong growth in the wcdma market as we leverage our high quality products and customer relationships to further a strong and growing list of wcdma phone manufacturer customers 
growing demand for phones and devices with greater multimedia functionality will continue to drive demand for increasing functionality in our msm chips 
we will continue to invest heavily to position our qct business for success in the wcdma market  as well as to continue to maintain our strong position in the cdma market 
in particular  we intend to continue to invest significant resources in developing integrated circuit products to support high speed wireless internet access and multimode  multiband  multinetwork operation including cdma x and xev do  wcdma  flo  ofdm and multimedia applications which encompass development of graphical display  camera and video capabilities  as well as higher computational capability and lower power on chip computers and signal processors 
we continue to work on different initiatives for low cost phones in addition to reducing costs through further integration of multimedia capabilities of mid to high end phones 
we will also continue our significant development efforts with respect to our brew applications development platform and our new mediaflo content distribution system and flo technology for delivery of low cost multimedia content to multiple subscribers 
we are working closely with many operators and manufacturers to support rapid and reliable wcdma deployment and availability of wcdma phones with increasing multimedia features and capabilities 
we expect that in average wcdma phone prices will decrease significantly  although we expect them to still be higher than average cdma phone prices 
brew is expected to play an increasingly important role in generating consumer demand for wireless phones 
brew offers operators new capabilities for their products and an open platform for delivery of data services that can grow operator s data revenues 
we expect more operators to launch brew services and greater volumes of brew software downloads to drive increasing revenues for our brew business 
although we have taken action to mitigate shortages of integrated circuits that we supply  the effects of such shortages have caused some customer frustration and could negatively affect our future business 
we expect that the costs of certain integrated circuit products could increase as a result of our efforts to increase the availability of products in short supply 
while we work closely with customers to expedite their processes for evaluating products from our new foundry suppliers  in some instances  transition to new product supply may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific products to individual customers 
as a result of our efforts to increase capacity at our current suppliers combined with the potential to bring on additional suppliers  we expect our shortages of integrated circuits to be alleviated in the future 
we are dependent upon the adoption and commercial deployment of g wireless communications equipment  products and services based on our cdma technology to increase our revenues and market share 
we continue to face significant competition from non cdma technologies  as well as competition from companies offering other cdma based products 
you should also refer to the risk factors included in this annual report for further discussion of these and other risks related to our business 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in south korea  the united states and japan comprised  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues in fiscal as compared to  and  respectively  in fiscal  and  and  respectively  in fiscal we distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location 
the increase in revenues from customers in japan  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to higher royalties from licensees in japan resulting from the growth of cdma and wcdma in japan as well as their success in exporting products worldwide 
the decrease in revenues from customers in the united states  as a percentage of the total  is primarily attributed to overall increases in revenues in geographic regions other than the united states 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  from royalties for our intellectual property  from messaging and other services and related hardware sales  from software development and related services  and from license fees for intellectual property 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates 
we license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of cdma including  without limitation  cdmaone  cdma x x ev do xev dv  td scdma and wcdma products 
we recognized royalty revenue as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made for certain licensees through the third quarter of fiscal starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognize revenues solely when royalties are reported to us by our licensees as we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate these amounts 
the change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the fact that no estimated royalty revenues were recorded in that quarter 
as a result of this change  we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in applying our revenue recognition policies with respect to the timing and amount of recording our royalty revenues will have a less material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
as of september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million and million  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority strategic investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
these investments totaled million at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing a publicly traded investment for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the performance of the investee s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
in the event our judgments change as to 
table of contents other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine 
these investments totaled million at september  we record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
when assessing investments in private companies for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  the share price from the investee s latest financing round  the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the liquidity and cash position  including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party evaluations  valuation reports or advice from investment banks 
we also consider new products services that the investee may have forthcoming  any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee s competitors and or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates 
in the event our judgments change as to other than temporary declines in value  we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
income taxes 
our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
should the actual results differ from our estimates  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of september   gross deferred tax assets were billion 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   the company has recorded gross deferred tax assets of million related to capital loss carry forwards 
we can only use capital losses to offset capital gains 
based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies  we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance in the amount of million for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
no provision has been made for united states federal and state  or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately billion as of september  should we repatriate foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made 
we are currently studying the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  and may decide to repatriate future earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  liquidity or financial position  the company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated 
table of contents liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
the company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the company s legal proceedings based on the company s belief that a liability  while possible  is not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
licensing we grant licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture  use and sale of cdma including  without limitation  cdmaone  cdma x xev do xev dv  td scdma and wcdma products 
licensees typically pay a nonrefundable license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee  typically five to seven years 
we earn royalties on such licensed cdma products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter  and  in some instances  although royalties are reported quarterly  payment is on a semi annual basis 
during periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees the estimated licensees in the quarter in which such sales occurred  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made 
not all royalties earned were estimated 
royalties for licensees for which we had minimal reporting history and certain licensees that did not incorporate our integrated circuit products into their own products were recorded one quarter in arrears  ie in the quarter in which the royalties were reported to us by those licensees 
estimates of royalty revenues for the estimated licensees were based on analyses of our sales of integrated circuits to estimated licensees  historical royalty data for estimated licensees  an estimate of the time between our sales of integrated circuits to estimated licensees and estimated licensees sales of cdma products  average sales price forecasts  estimates of inventory levels and current market and economic trends 
once royalty reports were received from the estimated licensees  the variance between such reports and the estimate was recorded as royalty revenue in the quarter in which the reports were received  ie in most cases  the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which the estimated royalties were recorded as revenue 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that  due to recent escalating business trends  we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from certain licensees 
these escalating trends include the commercial launches and global expansion of wcdma networks  changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees 
accordingly  we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter 
the change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal royalties reported by our licensees were million higher than royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in fiscal because million in royalties that were reported in the first quarter of fiscal had been estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal to facilitate an understanding of the impact of the change  the following table compares royalty revenues recorded as revenue in fiscal  and to royalties reported by our licensees during those same periods in millions 
table of contents royalty revenues from external licensees  as recorded in our consolidated statements of operations estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the prior year for estimated licensees estimate recorded at end of the current year for estimated licensees total royalties reported by external licensees during the current year recorded as revenue in the prior year  but reported by licensees during the current year 
the table above illustrates that the difference between royalties reported by external licensees and royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in our consolidated statements of operations has equaled the difference between the estimate for estimated licensees at the end of the current year and the estimate for estimated licensees at the end of the prior year 
strategic investments in our qsi segment our qsi segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications 
qsi segment assets totaled million at september   compared to million at september  in general  we enter into strategic relationships with cdma wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry 
due to financial and competitive challenges facing cdma wireless operators  we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of cdma technologies 
cdma wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories  are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and or have limited financial resources 
if these cdma wireless operators are not successful  we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators 
our qsi segment maintains strategic holdings of various issuers and types 
these securities include available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we strategically invest in companies in the high technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments 
available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments recorded at fair value subject us to equity price risk 
the fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility 
our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility 
in general  our investments in available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments suffered significant decreases in market value during the last three years 
downward fluctuations and market trends could further adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions 
qsi also makes strategic investments in privately held companies  including early stage companies and venture funds 
these investments are recorded at cost or under the equity method  but the recorded values may be written down due to changes in the companies conditions or prospects 
these strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize 
as a result  we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies  which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results 
most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment  if at all 
to the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives  we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain loss in investment income expense 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary  we will record a charge to investment income expense 
during fiscal  and  the qsi segment recognized million  million and million  respectively  in charges related to other than temporary losses on marketable and private securities 
in some cases  we make strategic investments that require us 
table of contents to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies 
the consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments 
from time to time  we may accept an equity interest in a licensee as consideration for a portion or all of the license fee payable under our cdma license agreement 
qtl records license fee revenue based on the fair value of the equity instruments received  if determinable 
the measurement date for determination of fair value is the earlier of the date at which a performance commitment is made or the date at which the performance is complete 
the evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is publicly traded  examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee s business plan if not publicly traded  and performing other due diligence procedures 
this equity program does not affect the licensees obligations to pay royalties under their cdma license agreements 
the amount of cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms of each agreement 
as of september   ten licensees have participated in this program 
we recognized million of revenue in each of fiscal and and million of revenue in fiscal related to equity received as license fees 
the equity investments received from this program are assets of qsi 
key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal included the sale of the v sper operating companies and related assets which are presented as discontinued operations  our receipt from pegaso of prepayment of our million loan facility  and ongoing investment in inquam 
discontinued operations in our qsi segment 
in fiscal  we acquired ownership interests in two companies in brazil  v sper s o paulo sa and v sper sa the v sper operating companies 
in november  we consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial restructuring of the v sper operating companies  which resulted in our holding direct and indirect controlling ownership interests in the v sper operating companies 
on december  the closing date  embratel participa es sa embratel acquired our direct and indirect ownership interests in the v sper operating companies the embratel sale transaction for no consideration 
the v sper operating companies existing communication towers and related interests in tower site property leases v sper towers were not included in the embratel sale transaction  and as such  we effectively retained  through a new wholly owned subsidiary towerco  ownership and control of the v sper towers 
the v sper towers had a net book value of approximately million at december  concurrent with the closing  the v sper operating companies entered into a year agreement renewable at the v sper operating companies option for up to two successive year terms whereby the v sper operating companies would pay a monthly fee to us for use of aerial and ground space on the tower sites 
we provided approximately million to fund operations of the v sper operating companies during the first quarter of fiscal prior to their sale and additionally provided approximately million in aggregate funding to or for the benefit of the v sper operating companies on or before the closing date to facilitate the embratel sale transaction 
such funding enabled the v sper operating companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt at an agreed discount to allow us to retain ownership of the v sper towers free and clear of any local bank security interest 
the major classes of assets and liabilities sold in the embratel sale transaction included million in accounts receivable  million in inventory  million in other current assets  million in property  plant and equipment  million in other assets  million in accounts payable  million in payroll and other benefits related liabilities  million in unearned revenue  million in other current liabilities  million in long term debt and million in other liabilities 
we realized a net loss of million on the embratel sale transaction during the first quarter of fiscal  including a million loss on the net assets sold to embratel and a million loss related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in stockholders equity  partially offset by million in gains related to the extinguishment of local bank debt and the settlement of other liabilities 
on november   we won bids to acquire personal mobile service smp licenses in certain regions of brazil 
approximately million of the approximate million purchase price for the smp licenses was paid in december the remaining brazilian real denominated obligation was financed by the brazilian government at an interest rate of per annum  plus an adjustment for inflation 
these smp licenses were not included in the embratel sale transaction 
in december  we initiated a waiver and return of the smp licenses to anatel  the telecommunications regulatory agency in brazil 
in february  the waiver and return of the smp licenses was approved by anatel  and the license debt was extinguished 
we realized a net gain of million as a result of the removal of the million smp licenses and the related million debt and accrued interest during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents on march   we sold towerco to embratel in a separately negotiated transaction the towerco sale transaction for million in cash 
towerco s assets were primarily comprised of million in property  plant and equipment 
we realized a net gain of million on the towerco sale transaction during the second quarter of fiscal as a result of the disposition of the remaining operations and assets related to the v sper operating companies  we determined that the results of operations and cash flows related to the v sper operating companies  including the results related to towerco and the smp licenses and the gains and losses realized on the embratel and towerco sales transactions  should be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows 
our statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations 
for fiscal  and  revenues of million  million and million  respectively  were reported in the loss from discontinued operations 
at september   we had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the v sper operating companies  towerco or the smp licenses recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
prepayment of the pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa loan facility 
we had various financing arrangements  including a bridge loan facility  an equipment loan facility  interim and additional interim loan facilities  with pegaso comunicaciones y sistemas sa de sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of pegaso telecomunicaciones  sa de sa  a cdma wireless operator in mexico collectively referred to as pegaso 
on september   telef nica m viles telef nica acquired a controlling interest in pegaso 
on october   pegaso paid million in full satisfaction of the interim and additional interim loans 
on november   pegaso paid million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility 
we used approximately million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by pegaso to other lenders 
on june   pegaso prepaid million of the equipment loan facility  including accrued interest  in accordance with certain terms of the equipment loan facility 
on december   pegaso prepaid million  including accrued interest  in full satisfaction of the equipment loan facility 
we recognized million  million and million in interest income related to the pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal  and  respectively  including million and million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of the prepayments in fiscal and  respectively 
investment in inquam limited 
we have invested million in the convertible preferred shares of inquam limited inquam for an approximate ownership interest in inquam 
inquam owns  develops and manages wireless communications systems  either directly or indirectly  with the intent of deploying cdma based technology  primarily in europe 
starting in the third quarter of fiscal  we and another investor the other investor also extended million in bridge loan financings to inquam  including million in bridge loan funding put in place during fiscal we funded our approximate million share of these bridge loans and had no remaining funding commitment at september  inquam is a variable interest entity 
we do not consolidate inquam because we are not the primary beneficiary 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in inquam 
we recorded million  million and million in equity in losses of inquam during fiscal  and  respectively 
at september   our equity and debt investments in inquam totaled million  net of equity in losses 
on september   we agreed  along with the other investor  to guarantee the payment of amounts due by inquam under a bank credit agreement 
during fiscal  we and the other investor agreed to extend the guarantee and increase the maximum amount subject to the guarantee to million 
our maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an amount equal to of the amounts outstanding under inquam s credit agreement  up to a maximum of approximately million 
amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement totaled million as of september  the guarantee expires on november  when the bank credit facility matures 
inquam is currently working with the bank and other potential lenders to secure long term take out financing to repay the existing loan on the maturity date

we have fixed income securities consisting of cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities 
we also have diversified portfolios of non investment grade securities managed by institutional portfolio managers  which are subject to a higher degree of default risk than our investment grade fixed income portfolios 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments 
our fixed income investments have grown significantly in size and are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed income investments could lose value 
if the general economy were to weaken significantly  the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate and our fixed income investments could lose value 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
see note to the consolidated financial statements marketable securities for information about investments in marketable debt securities 
we have finance receivables and notes receivable both included in other assets that bear interest at fixed rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements composition of certain financial statement captions for information about finance receivables 
finance receivables and notes that bear interest at fixed rates could lose value if interest rates increase 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our fixed income investment portfolio  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average yield at cost

fas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  at september  was million 
we generally invest in companies in the high technology industry  and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
the portfolio s concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time  and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio s price volatility 
during the last three years  many technology stocks experienced significant decreases in value  negatively affecting the fair values of our 
table of contents available for sale equity securities and derivative instruments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at september  would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or million 
our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods 
accordingly  we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material 
additionally  we do not anticipate any near term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures 
the recorded values of these strategic investments totaled million at september  additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results in this annual report 
foreign exchange market risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   the value of our foreign currency forward contracts was insignificant  and there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments
