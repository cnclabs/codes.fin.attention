item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of the company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it should also be read in conjunction with the caution about forward looking statements section at the end of this discussion 
overview the company is headquartered in middleburg  virginia and conducts its primary operations through three wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank  tredegar and gpia 
the bank is a community bank serving western loudoun county  virginia with five full service branches and one limited service facility 
tredegar is a trust company headquartered in richmond  virginia with a branch office in middleburg  virginia 
gpia is a registered investment advisor headquartered in alexandria  virginia serving clients in states 
the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense and the quality of the assets 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
the bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on nonaccrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
tredegar and gpia generate fee income from providing investment management and trust services to its clients 
investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets under management  and  therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuation in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets 
in  the company continued to realize the benefit of high growth rates in both assets and net earnings 
by december   total assets reached million  an increase of 
total assets at december  were million 
loans  net of unearned income  grew from million at december  to million at december  this is the largest single year increase in portfolio loans in the past years 
management feels that both a slow down in the number of refinancings within the loan portfolio and an advertising campaign focused on the commercial lenders attributed to the loan portfolio increase 
total deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  low cost deposits  including demand checking  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  continue to drive much of the growth in deposits 
the net interest margin compression of basis points experienced during was offset by strong earning asset growth thus providing a increase net interest income 
results for were also favorably affected by the growth in revenues from the bank s acquisition of a minority interest in southern trust  tredegar s fiduciary fees and deposit service fees 
non interest expenses grew at a marginal rate of for the year compared to it is not expected that expense growth rates will remain this low in the future 
the company remains well capitalized with risk adjusted core capital and total capital ratios well above the regulatory minimums 
asset quality measures also remained consistently strong throughout the year 
the loan loss provision increased primarily due to loan growth 
the company plans to expand the integration of tredegar  gpia and the bank s investment services department into a more focused wealth management program for all of the company s clients 
also  through the affiliation with southern trust  the bank plans to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property 
the bank plans to continue its focus on low cost deposit growth with advertising campaigns that target potential clients affected by recent bank mergers 
management has developed a branching strategy that includes expansion into warrenton fauquier county  herndon loudoun county and sterling loudoun county  virginia 
management will look for key lenders in those markets to join the bank s team to generate earning assets and awareness prior to the branch opening 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
recent financial developments on april   the bank acquired a interest in southern trust 
upon the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  the bank s existing mortgage operation was assumed by southern trust 
in connection with the southern trust investment  the bank entered into two loan participation agreements with southern trust 
one arrangement is a tri party agreement among the bank  southern trust and colonial bank  southern trust s warehouse line lender 
the agreement details the arrangements by which the bank purchases of selected loans from colonial bank 
the bank charges southern trust a rate equal to the one month libor rate at the time of purchase plus basis points 
as noted in the tri party agreement  the bank does not intend to hold the purchased loans more than days  colonial bank maintains the note documentation on behalf of the bank and the bank will engage semi annual testing to be conducted by a third party to validate colonial bank procedures 
at december   the balance of the bank s participated mortgages held for sale was million 
the tri party agreement is capped at million 
the bank also entered into a construction loan participation agreement with southern trust 
according to this agreement  the bank can purchase of selected construction loans and draws  up to million in outstanding balances and million in commitments 
the bank will charge southern trust an interest rate equal to the prime rate on the outstanding participated loans held by the bank 
adjustments in rate related to movements in the prime rate will be made monthly 
there were million in outstanding construction participation loans at december  overall  the benefit of the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust including the construction loan participations and tri party warehouse line agreement added an additional 
per diluted share to the net income of the company over what the company would have earned on mortgage banking operations without southern trust 
the construction loan participation program and the loans garnered under the tri party warehouse agreement contributed 
per diluted share to the total number 
without the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  the mortgage banking department of the bank would have added 
per diluted share for in  the mortgage banking department of the bank earned 
per diluted share 
it is expected that equity earnings from southern trust will decrease in the company exercised its option to buy gpia in april the terms of the transaction included a total purchase price of million with  common shares of the company issued to the shareholders of gpia 
at the time of acquisition  gpia had approximately million of assets under management with clients in states 
clients who are located in washington  dc  maryland and virginia account for approximately of the assets under management 
assets under management by both tredegar and gpia approached billion at december  critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan and lease portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans and leases  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans and lease losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan and lease losses of the bank as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
intangibles and goodwill the bank has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   a decrease of  since december  on april   the bank acquired gpia  a registered investment advisor  for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation using fas and as a guideline was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the bank 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  fas requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
when the bank completes its ongoing review of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  factors that are considered important to determining whether an impairment might exist include loss of customers acquired or significant withdrawals of the assets currently under management and or early retirement or termination of key members of management 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations net income net income for was million  an increase of over s net income of million 
net income for increased over s net income of million

return on average assets roa measures how effectively the company employs its assets to produce net income 
the roa for the company increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the increase in roa stems largely from equity earnings from the investment in southern trust 
the decrease in the net interest margin and additional investments in fixed assets during contributed to the basis point decrease in the roa 
the roa for was 
return on average equity roe  another measure of earnings performance  indicates the amount of net income earned in relation to the total equity capital invested 
roe increased to for the year ended december  roe was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the additional capital issued in the acquisition of gpia contributed the decrease in roe during the following table reflects an analysis of the company s interest income using the daily average balances of the company s assets and liabilities as of december non accrual loans are included in the loan balances

income and yields include dividends on preferred bonds that are excludable for tax purposes 
net interest income net interest income represents the principal source of earnings of the company 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  this is an increase of over the million reported for the same period in net interest income for increased over the million reported for the increase in net interest income in resulted from the growth in average earning assets 
the basis point decrease in earning assets yield was offset somewhat by a basis point decrease in the cost of funding 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to 
the average balance in the securities portfolio increased by million while the tax equivalent yield decreased basis points to 
the directives for the investment portfolio are focused on much shorter maturities and weighted average lives that have lower yields 
this directive coupled with significant principal paydowns throughout have impacted the overall investment portfolio yield 
the average loan portfolio volume increased during conversely  the average yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points 
loan demand was strong through out  however the decrease in average loan yield offset much of the potential growth in interest income from loan portfolio growth 
loan demand continues to remain strong and the bank has developed several strategies to add commercial lenders in markets that the bank plans to build branches 
the average balance of low cost interest bearing accounts interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts grew to million at december  the cost of such funding decreased basis points over the year ended december  the average balances in certificates of deposit decreased  while the interest expense associated with these deposits decreased or  the bank s interest rates on deposits are within the range of local market rates however management feels that deposit rates are at their lowest 
further significant decreases in deposit rates may impact the bank s ability to attract core deposits at the previously experienced growth rates 
the company s reliance on other funding sources  such as the federal home loan bank overnight advances  increased on average by million with a related increase in interest expense of only  during  however  the company increased on average its long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank and trust preferred issuance by million 
much of the increase in borrowings was related to the increase in loan balances from the tri party warehouse agreement with southern trust 
total interest expense for was million  a decrease of  compared to the total interest expense for management expects that the net interest margin will experience some additional compression in the compression will come from the inability to make further significant decreases to deposit rates and a reduction in assets yields as a result of shortening in the duration of the investment portfolio and a more competitive rate environment in the commercial lending area 
the asset liability management committee continues to focus on various strategies to maintain the net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income in resulted from the growth in average earning assets 
the basis point decrease in earning assets yield was offset by a basis point decrease in the cost of funding  which allowed the net interest margin to remain above throughout the average balance in the securities portfolio increased by million while the tax equivalent yield decreased basis points to 
nevertheless  the increase in the average balance of the securities portfolio was able to provide million in additional interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
the average loan portfolio volume increased during conversely  the average yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points 
loan demand was strong throughout  however the loan portfolio experienced significant run off due to borrower refinancings of residential real estate loans 
in  the company experienced significant growth in its interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts 
despite a increase in the average balances of these accounts  the decline in deposit rates during allowed the company to experience a decrease in the respective interest expenses of  the average balances in certificates of deposit increased  while the interest expense associated with these deposits decreased or million 
the company s reliance on other funding sources  such as the federal home loan bank overnight advances  decreased on average by million with a related decrease in interest expense of  during  however  the company increased on average its long term borrowings from the federal home loan bank by million 
total interest expense for was million  a decrease of million compared to the total interest expense for the following table analyzes changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities compared to changes in interest rates

provision for loan losses the company s loan loss provision during and was  and  respectively 
the company is committed to making loan loss provisions that maintain an allowance that adequately reflects the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
this commitment is more fully discussed in the asset quality section below 
noninterest income noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability 
management recognizes this and continues to review and consider areas where noninterest income can be increased 
noninterest income includes fees generated by the mortgage banking and investment sales departments of the bank as well as by tredegar and gpia 
noninterest income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for during and for the first four months of  mortgage banking income and certain loan fees related to mortgage banking were reported on a gross income basis 
all expenses of that department were reported within noninterest expenses 
all earnings of that department after april  are being reported as equity in earnings from affiliate  following the transfer of the bank s mortgage banking department to southern trust 
equity in earnings from affiliate of million for the year ended december  is the result of the interest in southern trust 
the equity earnings in southern trust added 
per diluted share after tax for the year ended december  in  southern trust and the bank s mortgage banking department originated and closed billion in loans with of that production attributable to purchase money financing 
total loan closings were million for the year ended december  southern trust expects that production attributable to refinancings  which have leveled off  will continue to decrease slightly in the first quarter of this production decrease  and any decreases associated with the seasonality of home sales  is expected to be offset somewhat by an increase in purchase money financings and new construction loans 
service charges  which include both deposit fees and certain loan fees  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  investment advisory fees of million for the year ended december  are from gpia 
gpia was purchased on april  causing the amount of revenue reported in to be only for three quarters 
investment advisory fees increased in compared to an annualized investment advisory fee balance 
gpia is predominantly a fixed income money manager that bases its fee upon the market value of the accounts under management 
the fixed income market experienced significant fluctuations throughout  ultimately causing marginal growth in fees in spite of good business development 
tredegar produced fiduciary fees that increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in assets under administration at tredegar grew or million to million at december  two new business development officers were added who contributed to the growth in assets under administration 
fiduciary fees are also based primarily upon the market value of the accounts under administration 
investment sales fees increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  a strategic decision was made to change the broker dealer clearing provider in the investment services department 
it is anticipated that the new clearing relationship will provide better client service  heightened regulatory control  additional growth opportunities  and improved financial contribution to the bank 
the bank currently employs three financial consultants and plans to expand the representation into every branch and market the bank serves 
trust fee income decreased during to million 
a significant portion of trust fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  so any decreases in market value of the assets under management result in a similar decrease in fees 
tredegar s accounts are typically invested in equities with a smaller allocation to fixed income securities 
the continued decline in equity market values have more than offset all of the growth in the fees as result of new business 
gpia s investment advisory fees added million to noninterest income for the eight months that it was a subsidiary of the bank 
like tredegar  their fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  however gpia s clients have substantially more invested in fixed income securities 
the fixed income market typically has an opposite reaction to the equity markets thus about of their fee increase over was related to relative increases in market values of the portfolios managed while the remaining was related to new business growth 
due to historic low mortgage rates and increased refinancings  the mortgage banking department contributed an additional  of fees on loans held for sale during during  the bank increased its transaction oriented deposit accounts by resulting in growth in service charges and fee income 
the service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts increased during during  the company realized  in net losses as a result of restructuring the investment portfolio in response to the change in the interest rate environment in total noninterest income for was million  compared to million for noninterest income for increased to million from million in the increase is due primarily to the increase on fees on loans held for sale  investment sales fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
the mortgage banking department contributed an additional  of fees on loans held for sale during the service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts increased during the increase in these fees was due primarily to a increase in transaction oriented deposit account growth 
noninterest income years ended december in thousands service charges  commissions and fees trust fee income investment advisory fee income fees on loans held for sale commission on investment sales equity earnings in affiliate other operating income noninterest income gains losses on securities available for sale  net total noninterest income noninterest expenses noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for additions to staff to support business development  branching and the formation of a wealth management group have contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits during the growth in salary expense was a marginal during because the commissions and salary expense related mortgage banking were reported within the equity earnings from affiliate after april  if the mortgage banking department of the bank remained within the bank after the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  salary and benefit expense would have been approximately  higher or increased year over year 
net occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the building expansion program  which includes the operations center and the second leesburg branch  continued to affect net occupancy and equipment expense year over year 
advertising expense decreased in to  because the bank focused more on in branch promotions and business development calling to increase sales rather than paid advertising 
computer operations expense includes fees paid to a third party vendor for online banking services 
the online banking fees increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the same period in other increases in computer operations relate to increases in support and maintenance fees paid to the application software and hardware vendors 
it is expected that noninterest expenses will increase at a faster pace in some of the increase will be associated with additional staffing to support branching growth and additional business development goals 
total noninterest expenses increased or million to million in the acquisition of gpia on april  accounts for or million of the total increase in noninterest expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million or due to increased commission expense for fee related business and enhancing the internal infrastructure to support a growing organization 
approximately  of the million increase in salaries expense is related to the acquisition of gpia 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or to million 
the costs to move the existing operations departments from the company s main office to the operations facility as well as readying the buildings for occupancy have caused the increase in occupancy and equipment expense 
advertising expense increased in two additional bank mergers within the market areas presented opportunities for additional image advertising that resulted in increased business 
computer operations expense increased to  during the bank placed in service additional equipment to enhance the security infrastructure of the internal network as well as upgraded the core bank processing software 
an increase in the usage of internet banking services by accountholders also contributed to the increase in computer operations expense 
other operating expenses increased  to million for compared to million for expenses associated with servicing an increased volume of accounts and transactions such as postage and printing have also impacted other operating expenses in noninterest expenses increased or million to million in this increase resulted from both pressures to provide competitive salary and benefit programs and occupancy and equipment investments to position the bank for future growth and productivity 
noninterest expenses years ended december in thousands salaries and employee benefits net occupancy and equipment expense advertising computer operations other operating expenses total income taxes reported income tax expense was million for  an increase of million compared to million for the effective tax rate for was compared to in and in the increase in the effective tax rate for was influenced by the change in the mix of the investment securities portfolio and the increase in noninterest income

the bank developed a strong image advertising campaign during that focused on its commercial lenders 
this campaign built additional awareness within the market 
additionally  the bank hired three commercial lenders since january  each of whom have significant experience within the loudoun county market 
upon the acquisition of the minority interest in southern trust  the bank entered into a construction loan participation agreement with southern trust 
according to this agreement  the bank can purchase of selected construction loans and draws  up to million in outstanding balances and million in commitments 
the bank will charge southern trust an interest rate equal to the prime rate plus basis points on the outstanding participated loans held by the bank 
adjustments in rate related to movements in the prime rate will be made monthly 
there were million in outstanding balances of these construction loans at december  each of these factors have contributed to the strong loan growth during management has developed a branching strategy that includes expansion into warrenton fauquier county  herndon loudoun county and sterling loudoun county  virginia 
management will look for key lenders in those markets to join the bank s team to generate earning assets and awareness prior to the branch opening 
also  through the affiliation with southern trust  the bank plans to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property loans increased from million at december  to million at december  the loan to deposit ratio increased to at december   compared to at december  and at december  loan portfolio at december in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage residential family home equity lines non farm  non residential agricultural consumer installment total loans this category generally consists of commercial and industrial loans where real estate constitutes a source of collateral 
at december   residential real estate family portfolio loans constituted of the total portfolio and increased million during the year 
the current historic low mortgage interest rates have caused many of the bank s clients to refinance to a long term fixed rate product 
real estate construction loans consist primarily of pre sold family residential loans along with a marginal amount of commercial construction loans 
real estate construction loans increased to million at december  and represent of the total loan portfolio 
the company s one time closing construction permanent loan product competes successfully in a high growth market like loudoun county because the company is local and can respond quickly to inspections and construction draw requests 
non farm  non residential real estate loans are typically owner occupied commercial buildings 
non farm  non residential loans were of the total loan portfolio at december  the increase in the non farm non residential real estate loans is the result of both a strong image advertising campaign during and the hiring of three commercial business development officers during each of whom have been successful in attracting new business to the bank 
the branch network has also helped to support the loan portfolio diversification  such as increased commercial real estate loans

generally business debt has declined nationwide as well as locally thus causing a decrease in loan demand 
consumer installment loans primarily consist of unsecured installment credit and account for of the loan portfolio 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  the company generally does not extend loans outside its principal market area 
the company s market area for its lending services encompasses fauquier and loudoun counties  where it operates full service branches 
the company s unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december  and million at december  the increase in the amount of unfunded commitments is attributed in part to the increase in real estate construction financing as well as customer demand for credit line products  primarily home equity lines 
at december   the company had no concentration of loans in any one industry in excess of of its total loan portfolio 
however  because of the nature of the company s market  loan collateral is predominantly real estate

these include underwriting standards for new originations and ongoing monitoring and reporting of asset quality and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
total nonperforming assets  which consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed property  were  at december  this is a decrease of  from the december  balance of million 
the majority of the decrease resulted from the pay off of two residential real estate loans 
both loans were to the same borrower 
nonperforming assets were  at december  nonperforming assets loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses be charged against earnings 
for real estate loans  upon foreclosure  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair market value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends 
if a write down of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value  additional write downs of the property value are charged directly to operations

at december   the bank had no potential problem loans 
the allowance for loan losses was of nonperforming loans at december  at december  and the allowance for loan losses was and  of nonperforming loans

the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior years or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends 
additionally  the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for the future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the total portfolio

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this standard requires classification of investments into three categories  held to maturity htm  available for sale afs  or trading  as further defined in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company does not maintain a trading account and has classified no securities in this category 
htm securities are required to be carried on the financial statements at amortized cost 
afs securities are carried on the financial statements at fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  are reflected in shareholders equity 
the htm classification places restrictions on the company s ability to sell securities or to transfer securities into the afs classification 
since the company desires the flexibility to respond to changing balance sheet needs through investment portfolio management  it has chosen to classify only a small portion of its portfolio in this category 
at december   of the portfolio was classified as htm 
the company holds in its loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in prime lending rate 
these holdings are not considered speculative but instead necessary for good asset liability management 
the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million at december   an increase of million or from the carrying value of million at december  the market value of the afs securities at december  was million 
the unrealized loss on the afs securities was million at december  this loss was offset by the december   unrealized gain of million 
the net market value gain at december  is reflective of the continued low level of market interest rates 
the net unrealized gain on the afs securities was million at december  although the bank anticipates much of the balance sheet growth experienced during  if any  to be in the form of net portfolio loans  specific strategies will be executed during the early part of to grow the investment portfolio by nearly the amount it had grown during  or approximately million 
because net loan growth is anticipated to come in at a slower rate during the beginning of than the later part of the year  an investment strategy is intended to be executed in order to increase the amount of earning assets for the bank

this directive coupled with the significant principal paydowns experienced throughout have impacted the overall investment portfolio yield 
securities with maturities greater than five years total million and have an average yield greater than 
the securities portfolio represents approximately of the average earning assets of the company 
for that reason  it is managed primarily to provide superior returns without sacrificing interest rate  market and credit risk

average investments in federal funds sold and money market investments in were million and million  respectively 
the decreases experienced in both the amount of funds available for investment in federal funds sold and money market investments during reflect the bank s need to utilize available funds to support the growth in higher yielding assets like loans and investment securities 
deposits deposits continue to be an important funding source and primary supply of the company s growth 
the company s strategy has been to increase its core deposits at the same time that it is controlling its cost of funds 
the maturation of the branch network  as well as increased advertising campaigns and bank mergers  have contributed to the significant growth in deposits over the last several years 
by monitoring interest rates within the local market and that of alternative funding sources  the company is able to price the deposits effectively to develop a core base of deposits in each branch

the average balance in interest checking and money market accounts grew and  respectively  during management believes that some of the growth in the average balances of money market accounts is associated with the movement of money from the equity markets to bank accounts  a significant portion of the growth is also core growth 
the company will continue to fund assets primarily with deposits and will focus on core deposit growth as the primary source of liquidity and stability 
the company offers individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including demand and interest checking  money market  savings and time deposit accounts 
the company neither purchases brokered deposits nor solicits deposits from sources outside its primary market area

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and interest rate swaps 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
unfunded commitments under lines of credit are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
those lines of credit may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the bank is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the bank holds certificates of deposit  deposit accounts  and real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
a summary of the bank s contractual obligations at december  is as follows payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations total obligations the bank does not have any capital lease obligations or operating lease obligations  as classified under applicable fasb statements  or other purchase or long term obligations 
capital resources and dividends the company has an ongoing strategic objective of maintaining a capital base that supports the pursuit of profitable business opportunities  provides resources to absorb risks inherent in its activities and meets or exceeds all regulatory requirements 
the federal reserve board has established minimum regulatory capital standards for bank holding companies and state member banks 
the regulatory capital standards categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four categories that weigh balance sheet assets according to risk  requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  composed of common equity and retained earnings 
the company had a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at december   and december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and at december  and  respectively 
both ratios exceed the minimum capital requirements adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies

federal regulatory agencies impose certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and the transfer of assets from the banking subsidiaries to the holding company 
historically  these restrictions have not had an adverse impact on the company s dividend policy  and it is not anticipated that they will in the future 
liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  short term investments  securities classified as available for sale as well as loans and securities maturing within one year 
as a result of the company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes the company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and meet its customers credit needs 
the company also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
the bank maintains federal funds lines with large regional and money center banking institutions 
these available lines total approximately million  of which million were outstanding at december  federal funds purchased during averaged  compared to an average of  during at december  and  the bank had million and million  respectively  of outstanding borrowings pursuant to securities sold under agreement to repurchase transactions repo accounts  with maturities of one day

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no

the provisions of the statement were effective december  management currently intends to continue to account for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion and related interpretations 
for this reason  the transition guidance of sfas no 
does not have an impact on the bank s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
the statement does amend existing guidance with respect to required disclosures  regardless of the method of accounting used 
the revised disclosure requirements are presented herein 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of the interpretation were effective beginning january  the initial adoption of the interpretation did not materially affect the bank  and management does not anticipate that the recognition requirements of this interpretation will have a materially adverse impact on either the bank s consoli dated financial position or consolidated results of operations in the future 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities and when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation requires consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in cases where a the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or b in cases where the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
management has evaluated the bank s investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in trust preferred securities structures 
the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on either the bank s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
interpretive guidance relating to fin is continuing to evolve and the bank s management will continue to assess various aspects of consolidations and variable interest entity accounting as additional guidance becomes available

adoption of the statement did not result in an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on a new disclosure requirement related to unrealized losses on investment securities 
the new disclosure requires a table of securities which have unrealized losses as of the reporting date 
the table must distinguish between those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for months or more and those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than months 
the table is to include the aggregate unrealized losses of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date  and the aggregate fair value of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date 
in addition to the quantitative disclosure  fasb requires a narrative discussion that provides sufficient information to allow financial statement users to understand the quantitative disclosures and the information that was considered in determining whether impairment was not other than temporary 
the new disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december  the company has included the required disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by tredegar are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
given the current historic low in interest rates for the fiscal years of and  the model assumed only a basis point decrease in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp at the end of  the company s interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by 
on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
since december   the bank s balance sheet has grown by million 
both deposit inflows and increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank have provided the funding for the growth in the loan and securities portfolios 
overall  the bank continues to have minimal interest rate risks to either falling or rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  the bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the bank could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
during may  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to assume variable market indexed interest payments in exchange for fixed rate interest payments 
the interest rate swap was used to offset the cost of offering a premium market rate on a promotional retail certificate of deposit 
the company raised million in new deposits during this three day promotion 
the terms of the certificate of deposit and the fixed portion of the interest rate swap are identical 
the notional principal amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was million 
the original term was months and matured in may the weighted average fixed payment rate was throughout the term 
variable interest payments received were based on three month libor 
the effect of these agreements was to transform the certificates of deposit fixed rate liabilities to variable rate certificates of deposit liabilities 
the net income from these agreements was  for the year ended december  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
