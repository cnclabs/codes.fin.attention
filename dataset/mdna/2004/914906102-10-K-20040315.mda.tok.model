business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and eliminates the pooling method of accounting 
sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s business since the company has historically accounted for all business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life  such as broadcast licenses  ceased being amortized after december  the television and radio broadcast licenses have an indefinite life because the company expects to renew them and renewals are routinely granted with little cost  provided that the licensee has complied with the applicable rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc 
over the last five years  all television and radio licenses that have been up for renewal have been renewed  and there has been no compelling challenge to the license renewal 
the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the television and radio broadcast licenses and the related cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely 
these indefinite cash flows indicate that the broadcast licenses have an indefinite useful life 
therefore  a license would not be amortized until its useful life is deemed to no longer be indefinite 
the licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists  in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
and the emerging issues task force published issue  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets eitf 
the company evaluated its licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  as of october   in accordance with the guidelines of sfas no 
as it relates to assessing impairment and concluded that it did not have an impairment loss related to these assets 
in addition  under sfas no 
 an acquired intangible asset should be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
intangible assets with measurable lives will be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the use of the purchase method of accounting requires management to make certain judgments in estimates related to the fair value of assets acquired 
the company has obtained a preliminary appraisal of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of univision radio 
the company has made a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to fcc licenses  goodwill  advertising related intangible and favorable leases 
the company expects the appraisal to be completed by mid the company may have a material reclassification on a future balance sheet between goodwill and fcc licenses  both of which are expected to have an indefinite life 
in addition  there may be other identified intangibles that could have an impact on future expense 
these reclassifications could have a material impact on the deferred tax liability calculation
