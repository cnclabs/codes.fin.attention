the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about financial statement amounts 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
merchants significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses  which is established through the provision for loan losses  is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance for loan losses required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore evaluates it for adequacy each quarter 
management considers factors such as previous loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic and real estate market conditions  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms  and estimated fair value of collateral that secures the loans 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different allowance for loan losses 
income taxes merchants estimates its income taxes for each period for which a statement of operations is presented 
this involves estimating merchants actual current tax exposure  as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing timing of recognition of expenses  income and tax credits  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in merchants consolidated balance sheets 
merchants must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely a valuation allowance must be established 
significant management judgement is required in determining income tax expense  and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   there was no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
interest income recognition on loans interest on loans is included in income as earned based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan 
merchants policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest  and to reverse any uncollected interest recorded on loans  when scheduled payments become contractually past due in excess of days unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured

the oversight process on these loans includes an active risk management approach 
a management committee reviews the status of these loans each quarter and determines or confirms the appropriate risk rating and accrual status 
the findings of this review process are instrumental in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

loans past due days or more and still accruing interest merchants generally places loans that become or more days past due in nonaccrual status  if  in the opinion of management  the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured  loans may continue to accrue interest and be left in this category

policies and procedures related to the accrual of interest income merchants recognizes income on earning assets on the accrual basis  which calls for the recognition of income as earned  rather than when it is collected 
merchants policy is to classify a loan days or more past due with respect to principal or interest as a nonaccruing loan  unless the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest is assured 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccruing loans  and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is typically charged against current income 
a loan remains in nonaccruing status until the factors which suggest doubtful collectibility no longer exist  the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible  and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in those cases where a nonaccruing loan is secured by real estate  merchants can  and may  initiate foreclosure proceedings 
the result of such action will either be to cause repayment of the loan with the proceeds of a foreclosure sale or to give m erchants possession of the collateral in order to manage a future resale of the real estate 
foreclosed property is recorded at the lower of its cost or estimated fair value  less any estimated costs to sell 
any cost in excess of the estimated fair value on the transfer date is charged to the allowance  while further declines in market values are recorded as oreo expense in the statement of operations

allowance for loan losses the allowance is based on management s estimate of the amount required to reflect the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on circumstances and conditions known at each reporting date 
merchants reviews the adequacy of the allowance quarterly 
factors considered in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance include previous loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  risk rating composition  current economic and real estate market conditions and their effect on the borrowers  the performance of individual loans in relation to contract terms and estimated fair values of properties that secure impaired loans 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined using a consistent  systematic methodology  consisting of a review of the following key elements a specific reserve for loans identified as impaired  a general reserve for the various loan portfolio classifications  the unallocated portion of the allowance loans deemed impaired totaled million and million  and the related specific allocation of the allowance was thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
the impaired loan portfolio consists of the following nonaccrual loans with balances over thousand  restructured loans  loans past due over days  certain internally adversely classified loans which are days past due  and loans which have been assigned a specific allocation of the allowance merchants performs detailed and extensive reviews on these loans and on larger credits and problematic credits identified on the watched asset list  nonperforming asset listings and internal credit rating reports 
through these reviews merchants is able to determine if a loan requires a specific allocation of the allowance or is permanently impaired and needs to be charged down 
loans are evaluated by looking at the fair market value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent  or measuring the net present value of the expected future cash flows using the loan s original effective interest rate 
if the loan is impaired further analysis is performed to determine if the impairment is permanent 
if the impairment is deemed permanent the loan is charged down to its net realizable value through the allowance 
the general allowance is a percentage based reflection of historical loss experience and assigns a required allowance allocation by loan classification based on a fixed percentage of all outstanding loan balances 
the general allowance employs a risk rating model that grades loans based on their general characteristics of credit quality and relative risk 
for pass rated loans  appropriate allowance levels are estimated based on judgments regarding the historical loss experience  current economic trends  trends in the portfolio mix  volume and trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and off balance sheet credit risk 
as of december   the allowance related to pass rated loans was million 
for loans rated special mention or substandard  the allowance allocation is increased  as of december   the allowance related to special mention or substandard loans was million 
in addition to the specific and general components  there is an unallocated allowance that recognizes a measurement imprecision in the valuation and general components of the allowance and management s evaluation of various other conditions not measured in the specific and general components  including the following general economic and business conditions affecting merchants key lending areas  credit quality trends  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments as of december   the unallocated allowance was thousand  an increase from thousand at december  the increase in the unallocated allowance is primarily attributable to the decline in impaired and criticized classified loans during the year 
these loans have a higher reserve requirement that the rest of the loan portfolio 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of principal is doubtful 
to the extent management determines the level of anticipated losses in the portfolio has significantly increased or diminished  the allowance is adjusted through current earnings 
overall  management believes that the allowance is maintained at an adequate level  in light of historical and current factors  to reflect the level of credit risk in the loan portfolio 
loan loss experience and nonperforming asset data are presented and discussed in relation to their impact on the adequacy of the allowance 
the following table reflects merchants loan loss experience and activity in the allowance for the past five years 
in thousands average loans outstanding allowance beginning of year charge offs commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage installment credit cards total charge offs recoveries commercial  lease financing and all other loans real estate construction real estate mortgage installment credit cards total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses allowance end of year allowance to total loans net loan charge offs recoveries to average loans as of december   merchants allowance ratios were of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
although the allowance has declined over the past five years both in size and as a percentage of the loan portfolio  management has not added to the allowance for several reasons most notable is the shift in the composition of the loan portfolio over the last five years  on a percentage basis  from higher risk commercial assets classes to less risky residential categories  as shown on the table on page in addition  the previously described increase in the unallocated allowance indicates the allowance was adequate at december  merchants will continue to take all appropriate measures to restore nonperforming assets to performing status or otherwise liquidate these assets in an orderly fashion so as to maximize their value to merchants 
there can be no assurances that merchants will be able to complete the disposition of nonperforming assets without incurring further losses  or that merchants will continue to recognize substantial recoveries such as those received during the last five years 
the level of recoveries correlates closely to historical charge offs 
as the level of historical charge offs has declined so has the amount of total annual recoveries 
related party transactions merchants engages in banking transactions with certain of its directors and officers  and certain of their affiliates 
during merchants obtained legal services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand  and project management services from a firm associated with one of its directors totaling thousand 
merchants obtained insurance during through an insurance agency agency of which a director of merchants bank is president 
a director of merchants is also a director of one of the insurance companies through which the agency obtained insurance for merchants 
in  premiums paid to the agency totaled thousand  of which the insurance company received thousand 
merchants obtains these services on terms that are comparable to those that it would obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
at december   merchants had loans outstanding to directors  executive officers  and associates of such persons totaling million 
it is the policy of merchants to make these loans on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable lending transactions with other persons 
as of december   all loans to directors  officers  and certain of their affiliates  were performing in accordance with their contractual terms 
effects of inflation the financial nature of merchants consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations is more clearly affected by changes in interest rates than by inflation  but inflation does affect merchants because as prices increase the money supply tends to increase  the size of loans requested tends to increase  total company assets increase  and interest rates are affected by inflationary expectations 
in addition  operating expenses tend to increase without a corresponding increase in productivity 
there is no precise method  however  to measure the effects of inflation on merchants financial statements 
accordingly  any examination or analysis of the financial statements should take into consideration the possible effects of inflation

sources of liquidity for banks include short term liquid assets  cash generated from loan repayments and amortization  borrowing  deposit generation and earnings 
merchants has a number of sources of liquid funds  including million in available federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks at year end  an overnight line of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb of million  an estimated additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of million  and the ability to borrow through the use of repurchase agreements  collateralized by merchants investments  with certain approved counterparties 
merchants investment portfolio  which totaled million at december   is actively managed by the alco and is a strong s ource of cash flow for merchants 
the portfolio is fairly liquid  with a weighted average life of approximately years  and is available to be used as a source of funds  if needed 
contractual obligations merchants has certain long term contractual obligations  including long term debt agreements  operating leases for branch operations  and time deposits 
the maturity schedules for these obligations are as follows in thousands less than one year one year to three years three years to five years over five years total debt maturities operating lease payments time deposits commitments and off balance sheet risk merchants is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments primarily include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
such instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk that are not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
merchants uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the contractual amounts of these financial instruments at december   are as follows in thousands contractual amount financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to originate loans unused lines of credit standby letters of credit loans sold with recourse equity commitments to affordable housing limited partnerships commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments to originate loans generally have expiration dates within days of the commitment 
unused lines of credit have expiration dates ranging from one to two years from the date of the commitment 
since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent a future cash requirement 
merchants evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
upon extension of credit merchants obtains an appropriate amount of real and or personal property as collateral based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty

under fin no 
 merchants does not issue any guarantees that would require liability recognition or disclosure  other than its standby letters of credit 
merchants has issued conditional commitments in the form of standby letters of credit to guarantee payment on behalf of a customer and guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
standby letters of credit generally arise in connection with lending relationships 
the credit risk involved in issuing these instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
contingent obligations under standby letter s of credit totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively and represent the maximum potential future payments merchants could be required to make 
typically  these instruments have terms of months or less and expire unused  therefore  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
each customer is evaluated individually for creditworthiness under the same underwriting standards used for commitments to extend credit and on balance sheet instruments 
merchants policies governing loan collateral apply to standby letters of credit at the time of credit extension 
loan to value ratios are generally consistent with loan to value requirements for other commercial loans secured by similar types of collateral 
the fair value of merchants standby letters of credit at december  and  was insignificant 
equity commitments to affordable housing partnerships represent funding commitments by merchants to certain limited partnerships 
these partnerships were created for the purpose of acquiring  constructing and or redeveloping affordable housing projects 
the funding of these commitments is generally contingent upon substantial completion of the project and none extend beyond the fifth anniversary of substantial completion 
capital resources capital growth is essential to support deposit and asset growth and to ensure the strength and safety of merchants 
net income increased merchants capital by million in  million in and million in payment of dividends decreased merchants capital by million  million and million during  and  respectively 
stock repurchases decreased merchants capital by thousand  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition changes in the market value of merchants available for sale investment portfolio decreased capital by million in because of market value losses and the low interest rate environment  merchants pension plan was underfunded by million at december  this resulted in a million pre tax charge to equity for a minimum pension liability adjustment at december  the tax effected adjustment totaled million and was recorded as a reduction in accumu lated other comprehensive income at december   which decreased merchants capital accordingly 
merchants made a thousand contribution to the pension plan during this  coupled with increases in the market value of plan assets  led to a decrease of thousand in the minimum pension liability at december  the tax effected adjustment was a thousand increase in accumulated other comprehensive income at december  merchants is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulatory agencies 
to be considered adequately capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  merchants must maintain minimum levels of tier leverage  tier risk based and total risk based capital 
merchants was considered well capitalized by the regulators at december  the ratios for merchants are set forth below in thousands amount actual percentage tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage capital in january merchants board of directors approved a stock repurchase program 
the program has been extended until january under the program  merchants is authorized to repurchase up to thousand shares of its common stock 
as of december   merchants had purchased thousand shares of its common stock on the open market under the program at an average per share price of 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management general management and the board of directors of merchants are committed to sound risk management practices throughout the organization 
merchants has developed and implemented a centralized risk management monitoring program 
risks associated with merchants business activities and products are identified and measured as to probability of occurrence and impact on merchants low  moderate  or high  and the control or other activities in place to manage those risks are identified and assessed 
periodically  department level and senior managers re evaluate and report on the risk management processes for which they are responsible 
this documented program provides management with a comprehensive framework for monitoring merchants risk profile from a macro perspective  it also serves as a tool for assessing internal controls over financial reporting as required under the fdicia and the sarbanes oxley act of market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
merchants primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
an important component of merchants asset and liability management process is the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk  which is governed by established policies that are reviewed and approved annually by merchants board of directors 
the investment policy details the types of securities that may be purchased  and establishes portfolio limits and maturity limits for the various sectors 
the investment policy also establishes specific investment quality limits 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the alco 
in this capacity the alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting merchants asset and liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
merchants has an outside investment advisory firm which helps it identify opportunities for increased yield  without significantly increasing risk  in the investment portfolio 
the firm specializes in stable value and fixed income portfolios  and has a staff of investment professionals who research and track each bond 
the alco has a weekly conference call with the investment advisor 
during these calls the alco and the investment advisor discuss trading activity from the previous week  and set strategy for the ensuing week 
additionally  any specific bonds or sectors that require additional attention are discussed on these calls 
the investment advisory firm meets with the alco committee of merchants board of directors to perform a portfolio review on a quarterly basis 
they report on the overall performance of the portfolio and perform modeling of the cash flow  effective duration  and yield character istics of the portfolio under various interest rate scenarios 
the investment advisors also review and provide detail on individual holdings in the portfolio 
during the course of the last year  merchants position in corporate debt securities increased to million 
management feels that opportunities for increased yield  without taking on undue risk  exist in the corporate market 
merchants currently limits its position in corporate debt securities to approximately of capital and generally purchases corporate securities with a rating of a or above 
merchants also invested million in commercial mortgage backed securities  another area management feels has the opportunity for increased yield without taking on undue risk 
the goal is to enhance performance on an absolute and risk adjusted basis 
included in the securities available for sale portfolio is an asset backed security issued in connection with a securitization of medical equipment leases 
the servicer for the payments on these leases declared bankruptcy in july at december   the cost basis of the bond was million and the market value was million  resulting in an unrealized loss of thousand  or 
the bond owned by merchants is in the first  and accordingly the most secure  tranche of the securitization 
the bond started trading below par in august and was rated investment grade by moody s and fitch at december  there has been very little trading in the bonds and the market value has changed very little since august 
the bond carries credit enhancements in the form of overcollateralization and subordination 
merchants evaluated this investment for other than temporary impairment at year end and determined that a write down of the investment was not necessary at that date 
p rincipal payments on the bond had been withheld since august because of incorrectly prepared servicing reports 
on february   the bankruptcy court approved a settlement agreement transferring servicing to an affiliate of the trustee 
on march   merchants received a payment representing principal payments from august through january totaling thousand 
the substitute servicer released corrected servicing reports on february  merchants had anticipated the release of the corrected servicing reports  and based on conversations with its investment advisor and because of the uncertainty surrounding the servicer and the transfer of servicing  expected elevated levels of delinquencies 
the reports released on february   showed a delinquency rate of approximately  significantly higher than merchants had anticipated  over half of those delinquencies were in technical default status 
the bond was downgraded below investment grade by fitch on march  based upon management s consideration of these recent events  merchants liquidated its position on march   recognizing a loss of thousand on the sale 
upon further detailed evaluation of the investment portfolio  the alco identified approximately million in securities that it plans to sell 
these sales will generate a gain of approximately thousand 
most of the bonds identified for sale are in the asset backed security portfolio 
after the security sales merchants asset backed position will be reduced to approximately million 
in most instances the sale of the bonds will eliminate or reduce exposure to a specific market segment  or to a specific servicer 
the proceeds from these sales will be used to pay down short term fhlb borrowings 
merchants had continued its balance sheet leverage strategy during this sale will unwind the additional leverage merchants had put on the balance sheet during the first two months of the year 
after the sales merchants investment portfolio will be approximately million  and its short term fhlb borrowing position will be approximately million 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to a movement in interest rates  which  as described above  affects the company s net interest income 
asset liability management is governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the alco  chaired by the chief financial officer and composed of members of senior management  meets frequently to review and develop asset liability management strategies and tactics 
the alco is responsible for evaluating and managing the interest rate risk which arises naturally from imbalances in repricing  maturity and cash flow characteristics of merchants assets and liabilities 
techniques used by the alco take into consideration the cash flow and repricing attributes of balance sheet and off balance sheet items and their relation to possible changes in interest rates 
the alco manages its interest rate exposure primarily by using on balance sheet strategies  generally accomplished through the management of the duration  rate sensitivity and average lives of the company s various investments  and by extending or shortening maturities of borrowed funds  as well as carefully managing and monitoring the pricing of loans and deposits 
the alco also uses off balance sheet strategies  such as interest rate caps and floors and interest rate swaps  to help minimize the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the alco uses an outside investment advisor to recomme nd investments and assist in transaction execution  and an outside alco consultant to perform rate shocks of its balance sheets and a variety of other analyses for the committee 
the alco is responsible for ensuring that the board of directors receives accurate information regarding merchants interest rate risk position at least quarterly 
the investment advisor and alco consultant meet jointly with the alco and the asset liability committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis to review current position and discuss future strategies 
this review shows that merchants one year interest rate sensitivity gap has shifted from an almost neutral position one year ago to a million liability sensitive position 
as merchants has continued to fully invest its cash position  and strategically increase and reposition its investment portfolio using short term borrowings  the leverage on the balance sheet has caused a shift to a liability sensitive position 
because of the current rate environment  the consultant modified his rate shock model and modeled a basis point decrease as well as a basis point rate increase 
merchants has established a target range for the change in net interest income  given a basis point change in interest rates  of zero to 
the net interest income simulation as of december st showed that the change in net interest income for the next months from merchants expected or most likely forecast was as follows rate change percent change in net interest income up basis points down basis points the analysis currently shows some margin compression in the first year in both the rising and falling rate scenarios  if rates fall further it will be difficult for merchants to lower deposit rates enough to compensate for anticipated decreases in loan rates 
in a rising rate scenario  market rate increases affect the liability base faster than the asset side of the balance sheet 
the model shows that after deposit costs begin to stabilize  margins begin to widen and net interest income increases 
the degree to which this exposure materializes will depend  in part  on merchants ability to manage deposit rates as interest rates rise or fall 
the analysis discussed above includes no growth assumptions 
the consultant also runs additional simulations  modeling an upward movement in rates with a flattening yield curve  and a simulation using merchants current growth assumptions 
the growth model shows that margin dollars increase in all scenarios as merchants continues to grow its balance sheet 
the flattening yield curve scenario resulted in additional margin compression 
these types of dynamic analyses give the alco a more thorough understanding of how merchants balance sheet will perform in a variety of rate environments 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent merchants forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including without limitation the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit run off rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits and reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  among others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  merchants cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
the most significant factors affecting market risk exposure of net interest income during the year ended december   were i the shape and level and size of the us government securities and interest rate swap yield curve  ii changes in the size and composition of the investment portfolio  iii changes in the composition and size of the loan portfolio  and iv reduction of deposit interest expense 
during the yield curve fell significantly in both the year and year terms reaching lows of and during june of  a decrease of and basis points  respectively  from december   levels 
as a result  projected mortgage and loan prepayments increased throughout as interest rates reached levels not seen in years 
because of historically low rates and increased loan cash inflows  effective duration estimates for loans and mortgage backed securities became much shorter in than in as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will likely differ due to the varying impact of changes in the balances and mix of loans and deposits differing from those assumed  the impact of possible off balance sheet hedging strategies  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect all actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
the model used to perform the balance sheet simulation assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve over twelve months and reprices every interest bearing asset and liability on merchants balance sheet 
the model uses contractual repricing dates for variable products  contractual maturities for fixed rate products  and product specific assumptions for deposits such as free checking for life accounts and money market accounts which are subject to repricing based on current market conditions 
investment securities with call provisions are examined on an individual basis in each rate environment to estimate the likelihood of a call 
the model also assumes that the rate at which certain mortgage related assets prepay will vary as rates rise and fall  based on prepayment estimates derived from the office of thrift supervision net portfolio value model 
merchants interest rate sensitivity gap gap is pictured below as of december  interest rate gap analysis provides a static view of the maturity and repricing characteristics of merchants on and off balance sheet positions 
gap is defined as the difference between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specified periods 
an asset sensitive position positive gap indicates that there are more rate sensitive assets than rate sensitive liabilities repricing or maturing within a specified time period  which would imply a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of rising interest rates 
conversely  a liability sensitive position negative gap generally implies a favorable impact on net interest income during periods of falling interest rates 
there are certain limitations inherent in a static gap analysis 
these limitations include the fact that it is a static measurement and that it does not reflect the degrees to which interest earning assets and in terest bearing deposits may respond non proportionally to changes in market interest rates 
although the alco reviews all assumptions used in the model in detail  assets and liabilities do not always have clear repricing dates  and may reprice earlier or later than assumed in the model 
repricing date in thousands one day to six months over six months to one year one year to five years over five years total assets loans us treasury agency securities mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations other securities other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings other liabilities long term debt shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity cumulative gap gap as a of total earning assets based on historical experience and merchants internal repricing policies  it is merchants practice to present repricing of statement savings  savings deposits  free checking for life and now account balances in the one year to five years category 
merchants experience has shown that the rates on these deposits tend to be less rate sensitive than other types of deposits 
credit risk the board of directors reviews and approves merchants loan policy on an annual basis 
among other things  the loan policy establishes restrictions regarding the types of loans that may be granted  and the distribution of loan types within merchants portfolio 
merchants board of directors grants each loan officer the authority to originate loans on behalf of merchants  subject to certain limitations 
these authorized lending limits are reviewed at least annually and are based upon the lender s knowledge and experience 
loan requests that exceed a lender s authority require the signature of merchants credit division manager  senior loan officer  and or president 
all extensions of credit of million or greater to any one borrower or related party interest  are reviewed and approved by the loan committee of merchants board of directors 
merchants loan portfolio is continuously monitored for performance  creditworthiness and strength of documentation through the use of a variety of management reports and with the assistance of an external loan review firm 
credit ratings are assigned to commercial loans and are routinely reviewed 
loan officers or the loan workout function take remedial actions to assure full and timely payment of loan balances when necessary 
merchants policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest on loans when scheduled payments become contractually past due or more days and the ultimate collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful
