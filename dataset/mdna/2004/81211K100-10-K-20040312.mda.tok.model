introduction the company manufactures and sells a wide range of food  protective and specialty packaging products  operating in the united states and in other countries  with products distributed in those countries and in other parts of the world 
the company operates in two reportable business segments  food packaging and protective and specialty packaging 
the company s principal food packaging products are its flexible materials and related systems marketed primarily under the cryovac trademark for packaging a broad range of perishable foods and the company s rigid packaging and absorbent pads 
the company primarily sells the products in this segment to food processors  distributors and food service businesses 
the company s principal protective and specialty packaging products provide cushioning  surface protection and void fill 
the company primarily sells its protective and specialty packaging products and systems to distributors and manufacturers in a wide variety of industries 
the company employs over  sales and marketing personnel in the countries in which it operates  who market the company s products through a large number of distributors  fabricators and converters  as well as directly to end users such as food processors  food service businesses  and manufacturers 
the company has no material long term contracts for the distribution of its products 
in  no customer or affiliated group of customers accounted for or more of the company s consolidated net sales 
although net sales of both food packaging products and protective and specialty packaging products have tended to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter  the company does not consider seasonality to be material to its consolidated business 
competition for most of the company s packaging products is based primarily on packaging performance characteristics  service and price 
competition is also based upon innovations in packaging technology and  as a result  the company maintains ongoing research and development programs to enable it to maintain technological leadership 
the company s net sales are sensitive to developments in its customers business or market conditions  changes in the global economy  and the effects of foreign currency translation 
its costs can vary significantly with changes in petrochemical related costs  which are not within the company s control  consequently  the company s management focuses on reducing those costs that the company can control and using petrochemical based raw materials as efficiently as possible 
the company also believes that its global presence helps to insulate it from localized changes in business conditions that may more strongly affect some of its competitors 
as is discussed below  the company s business generates substantial cash flow 
the company believes that this cash flow will permit it to continue to invest in research and development at industry leading levels compared with its net sales  to make strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures  and to maintain the flexibility to modify its capital structure as the need or opportunity arises 
this cash flow will also keep the company prepared for the settlement and interest payment it will be required to make upon consummation of a plan of reorganization in the w

interest expense and other income expense  net interest expense increased in to million compared to million in but decreased in compared to million in the increase in was primarily due to additional accrued interest of million in on the cash portion of the asbestos settlement and interest paid or accrued of million in on the senior notes discussed below that were issued in april and july the decrease in was primarily due to lower average levels of outstanding debt compared with other income expense  net  consisted of income of million in  income of million in and expense of million in the change in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income of million and lower net foreign exchange losses in compared to the period of million 
the change in compared to was due to lower net foreign exchange losses during income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was an expense of in  a benefit of in and an expense of in the change in the effective tax rate from to was primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement and related costs in and improved tax efficiency in resulting from a reorganization of the company s international subsidiaries during the effective tax rate was lower than in due primarily to the estimated tax benefit of the asbestos settlement and its related costs and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in in  the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes and non deductible expenses  offset by the lower net effective tax rate on foreign earnings 
in  the effective tax rate was lower than the statutory us federal income tax rate primarily due to the effect of the estimated tax benefit for the asbestos settlement

for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings loss per common share for and  the company has adjusted net earnings ascribed to common shareholders to exclude the gains attributable to the repurchase of preferred stock and to add back dividends attributable to such repurchased preferred stock and has adjusted the weighted average common shares outstanding to assume conversion of the shares of preferred stock repurchased during these periods in accordance with the fasb s emerging issues task force topic d guidance 
in calculating diluted earnings per common share  the company s calculation of the weighted average number of common shares for assumes the issuance of nine million shares of common stock reserved for the asbestos settlement as described in note to the consolidated financial statements under the caption asbestos settlement and related costs  and the exercise of dilutive stock options  net of assumed treasury stock repurchases 
for and  the calculation of weighted average number of common shares assumes the effect of the weighted average conversion of repurchased shares of preferred stock 
the company did not assume the outstanding preferred stock had been converted in the calculation of diluted loss earnings per common share in and  because the treatment of the preferred stock as the common stock into which it could have been converted would have been anti dilutive  as conversion would have reduced the loss per common share or increased earnings per common share in those years 
the company did not reflect the shares of common stock reserved for issuance for the asbestos settlement in the loss per common share calculation since the effect would have been anti dilutive

the contractual operating lease obligations listed in the table above represent estimated future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable real and personal property leases as of december  the long term debt shown in the above table excludes unamortized bond discounts as of december  and  therefore  represents the principal amount of the debt required to be repaid in each period 
the company has the following long term contractual commitments approximately million for the purchase of equipment over a five year period which began in  together with a potential termination fee in an amount to be determined 
the company s obligation is reduced or increased based on market price changes for the equipment and changes in the packaging machinery manufacturers index

the company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that its liability in excess of the amounts that it has accrued for environmental matters will be material to its consolidated statements of operations  balance sheets or cash flows 
environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated 
the company evaluates these liabilities periodically based on available information  including the progress of remedial investigations at each site  the current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties

a syndicate of banks made this facility available to a group of the company s australian and new zealand subsidiaries for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of previously outstanding indebtedness 
the company may re borrow amounts repaid under the anz facility from time to time prior to the expiration or earlier termination of the facility 
no amounts were outstanding under the anz facility at december  accounts receivable facility in december  the company and a group of its us subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization program with a bank and an issuer of commercial paper administered by the bank 
the company considers that the receivables facility provides a source of short term liquidity 
under the receivables facility  the company s two primary operating subsidiaries  cryovac  inc and sealed air corporation us  sell all of their eligible us accounts receivable to sealed air funding corporation  an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of the company that was formed for the sole purpose of entering into the receivables facility 
sealed air funding in turn may sell undivided ownership interests in these receivables to the bank and the issuer of commercial paper  subject to specified conditions  up to a maximum of million of receivables interests outstanding from time to time

to secure the performance of their obligations under the receivables facility  sealed air funding and the operating subsidiaries granted a first priority security interest to the bank  as agent  in accounts receivable owned by them  proceeds and collections of those receivables and other collateral 
the bank and the issuer of commercial paper have no recourse to the company s  the operating subsidiaries or sealed air funding s other assets for any losses resulting from the financial inability of customers to pay amounts due on the receivables when they become due 
as long as a termination event with respect to the receivables facility has not occurred  the operating subsidiaries service  administer and collect the receivables under the receivables facility as agents on behalf of sealed air funding  the bank and the issuer of commercial paper

the receivables facility again became available for the sale of receivables interests originated by cryovac  inc as well as sealed air corporation us  up to the original maximum of million of receivables interests provided for by the receivables facility  on january  the parties also amended the receivables facility on april  to exclude the charge for the asbestos litigation settlement reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  from the calculation of the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility 
the company must comply with these interest coverage and leverage ratio covenants contained in the receivables facility in order to use the facility 
the company was in compliance with these ratios at december  under limited circumstances  the bank and the issuer of commercial paper can terminate purchases of receivables interests prior to the above dates 
a downgrade of the company s long term senior unsecured debt to bb or below by standard poor s rating services or ba or below by moody s investors service  inc  or failure to comply with interest coverage and debt leverage ratios  could result in termination of the receivables facility 
in connection with recording the accounting charge in the fourth quarter of for the asbestos settlement and related costs  the company requested and received a waiver of compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratios provided for in the receivables facility 
after reflecting this waiver  the company was in compliance with the requirements of the receivables facility as of december  the operating subsidiaries did not sell any receivables interests under the receivables facility during and  therefore  the company did not remove any related amounts from the consolidated assets reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  during  sealed air funding sold receivables interests to the issuer of commercial paper from time to time  however  as of december   neither the bank nor the issuer of commercial paper held any receivables interests and no related amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet at december  the receivables facility provides for the monthly payment of program fees which currently are per annum per annum at december  on the receivables interests sold by sealed air funding and commitment fees which currently are per annum per annum at december  on the unused portion of the million receivables facility

recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements the company is subject to numerous recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements 
note  new accounting pronouncements recently issued statements of financial accounting standards  accounting guidance and disclosure requirements  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is contained in item of part ii of this annual report on form k  describes these new accounting pronouncements and is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  known as us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates  and while any differences may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company does not believe that the differences  taken as a whole  will be material 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to its business operations and the understanding of results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates 
commitments and contingencies litigation on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against the company 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  the company uses its best judgment to determine if it is probable that it will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of these matters and whether a reasonable estimation of the probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  the company makes estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
the company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recovery  it is possible that disputed matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that the company has previously made 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and possible impairment expense in the company s consolidated financial statements 
self insurance the company retains the obligation for specified claims and losses related to property  casualty  workers compensation and employee benefit claims 
the company accrues for outstanding reported claims  claims that have been incurred but not reported  and projected claims based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims using historical experience  insurance company estimates and the estimated trends in claim values 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately project and record estimated claim payments  actual results could differ significantly from the recorded liabilities 
pensions although the company maintains a non contributory profit sharing plan and contributory thrift and retirement savings plans in which most us employees of the company are eligible to participate  the company does maintain defined benefit pension plans for a limited number of its us employees and for many of its non us employees 
the company accounts for these pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
the principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations  the expected future rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of future compensation increases and various other actuarial assumptions 
changes to these assumptions could have a significant impact on costs and liabilities recorded under sfas no 
income taxes the company s deferred tax assets arise from net deductible temporary differences and tax benefit carryforwards 
the company believes that its taxable earnings during the periods when the temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets become deductible or when tax benefit carryforwards may be utilized should be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
for those foreign jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax benefit carryforwards or the projected taxable earnings indicate that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable earnings  with consideration for the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax benefit carryforwards  to determine which deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable earnings 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods  the company may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements

the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates from time to time  the company may use interest rate swaps  collars or options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates

interest rate swaps in june  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million that were qualified and designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas no 
these agreements were entered into in order to convert a portion of the senior notes fixed rate debt into floating rate debt 
during september  the company terminated these swaps and reflected a basis adjustment to the senior notes for a portion of the cash received of approximately million 
the company is amortizing this amount and reflecting it as a component of interest expense over the remaining life of the senior notes 
the company was not party to any interest rate swap agreements at december  at december  and  the company had no interest rate collars or options outstanding 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt  giving effect to the impact of the interest rate swaps  was  million  of which  million was fixed rate debt 
at december   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million  of which approximately million was fixed rate debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s total debt  giving effect to the impact of the interest rate swaps  which reflects the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was  million at december  compared to million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of the total debt balance at december  of million 
these changes in the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt do not alter the company s obligations to repay the outstanding principal amount of this debt 
foreign exchange rates the company may use other derivative instruments from time to time  such as foreign exchange options to manage exposure due to foreign exchange rates and interest rate and currency swaps to gain access to additional sources of international financing  while limiting foreign exchange exposure and limiting or adjusting interest rate exposure by swapping borrowings in one currency for borrowings denominated in another currency

the estimated fair values of these contracts  which represent the estimated net payments that would be paid or received by the company in the event of termination of these contracts based on the then current foreign exchange rates  was a net payable of million and zero at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates at december  would have caused the company to pay approximately million to terminate these contracts 
the company s foreign subsidiaries had outstanding debt of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
this debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts 
commodities the company uses various commodity raw material and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing processes 
generally  the company acquires these components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices of these components
