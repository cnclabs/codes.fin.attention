forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among other things  the following possible changes in the levels and terms of reimbursement for our charges by government programs  including medicare or medicaid or other third party payors  existing laws and government regulations and changes in or failure to comply with laws and governmental regulations  our ability to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions  competition  demographic changes  technological and pharmaceutical improvements that increase the cost of providing  or reduce the demand for  our services  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including physicians  and our ability to finance growth on favorable terms 
undue reliance should not be placed on our forward looking statements 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained in this report in order to reflect future events or developments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following net patient service revenues we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services we render to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenues  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated receipts based upon the programs principles of payment or reimbursement either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final payment under these programs is subject to administrative review and audit  and we currently make provisions for any adjustments which may result 
our provisions for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based primarily on payment terms of contractual arrangements such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or a discounted percent from charges 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms to help assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information we believe to be available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of the bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the specific plan in which the patient participates 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as the local hospital s policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment is received from a third party  if any  statements are sent indicating the outstanding balance on the account 
if the account is still outstanding after a period of time  the account is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the purpose of this process is to work with the patient to resolve the outstanding debt 
the primary collection agency acts  in most cases  as an extension of our local hospitals business office 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect accounts that require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in the local hospital business office 
the primary collection agencies have proven very successful in collecting on the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is utilized when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off at that point as uncollectible 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if determined necessary by specific account identification  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
in many cases  patients who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent writeoffs are offered substantial discounts in efforts to settle their account balance 
all non governmental accounts over days old from date of discharge are reserved for in our allowance for bad debts 
for governmental accounts  an allowance for doubtful accounts is established for accounts over days old from date of discharge 
these accounts for which a reserve is placed include those accounts that are placed with a collection agency and for which legal action has been taken 
those accounts for which legal action has been taken are written off once a judgment has been obtained 
accounts under days old from the date of discharge that are placed with a primary collection agency are not reserved for in our allowance for doubtful accounts due to the fact that  in most cases  we consider the primary collection agencies extensions of our local hospital business offices and we do not feel as though a reserve is necessary until the primary collector has appropriately worked the account and has deemed it uncollectible 
accounts are reviewed individually for write off  but are not automatically written off when they reach days old 
accounts that are identified as private pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
significant changes in payer mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if these estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
as of the date of these financial statements  we were not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level  as defined by sfas no 
 on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment arise 
we periodically evaluate each reporting unit for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment review of our goodwill 
the impairment review indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue and profitability projections or market values could cause our analysis to indicate that our goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes we must make estimates in recording provision for income taxes  including determination of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize these benefits  and  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through fiscal year  which resulted in no material adjustments 
our fiscal year   and federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates we believe are accurate in order to determine that tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential audit adjustments 
professional liability insurance claims in response to the difficulty we encountered in obtaining primary insurance from commercial companies at reasonable rates  on october  we formed a wholly owned insurance subsidiary in order to self insure a greater portion of our primary professional and general liability risk 
our captive subsidiary reinsures risk up to million per claim and million million effective october  in the aggregate per hospital  and further acts as an excess insurer for all of our hospitals in combination with three commercial insurance companies 
the total cost of our professional liability program was approximately of net revenue in fiscal  of net revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we determine our accruals for self insured professional liability risks using asserted and unasserted claims identified by our incident reporting system as well as by using actuarially determined estimates based on our internal as well as industry wide historical loss payment patterns 
we have discounted our accruals for self insured professional liability risks to their present value using a discount rate of 
although the ultimate settlement of these accruals may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements are adequate 
however  if the actual payments of claims exceed our projected estimates of claims  our insurance accruals could be materially adversely affected 
results of operations overview during our fiscal year ended september   which we refer to as the period  we reported net revenue growth over our year ended september   which we refer to as the period  of  net income growth of and net earnings per diluted share growth of 
our revenue and net income growth resulted from increases in same hospital admissions  which are admissions to hospitals in operation for the entire period and period  rate increases and from hospitals acquired by us in the month period ended september  in addition  our earnings per diluted share increased both as a result of our increased net income and a reduction in our diluted shares outstanding following our redemption on august  of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due same hospital admissions increased in the period compared to the period 
we believe this increase is due in part to our adherence to the acquisition criteria we have strictly followed for many years  whereby we acquire hospitals in growing areas and in areas where we believe the opportunity to reverse outmigration to other hospitals exists 
furthermore  our hospitals continue to add additional physicians to their respective medical staffs and medical equipment to their hospitals in order to meet the needs of the communities they serve 
we believe these investments ultimately result in higher same hospital admissions 
outpatient services continued to play an important role in our delivery of health care  with roughly half of our net revenue during the period generated on an outpatient basis 
we continue to focus on emergency room operations and diagnostic imaging services to meet the needs of the communities we serve and have invested capital in nearly every one of our hospitals over the last five years in one of these two areas 
as a result  our same hospital adjusted admissions  which adjusts admissions for outpatient volume  increased in the period compared to the period 
our surgery volumes have been affected by changes in physician practices related to their increased expenses due to malpractice costs and declining or flat reimbursement rates 
outpatient surgeries for gastrointestinal  ent and ophthalmology have been impacted most severely  as physicians continue to move these procedures from our hospitals into their offices 
we believe that although this trend effects the number of surgeries performed at our hospitals  it does not have a material financial impact on our hospitals 
we had a decrease in same hospital surgeries of for the period compared to the period 
our bad debt expense in the period increased basis points to of net revenue 
we believe that this percent to net revenue is lower than our industry peer group average  primarily as a result of our long standing and consistently applied bad debt and charity care policies 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plan structure over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and under insured patients seeking health care in the united states 
although we are not immune to these trends  we believe that the general demographic profiles of our non urban markets  combined with our consistent application of charity care  indigent and bad debt policies over many years  have contributed to a relatively stable level of bad debt expense as compared to the rest of our industry 
during the fourth quarter ended september   four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall in florida  where we operate hospitals 
hurricane damage and disruption to our hospitals located in the affected areas  as well as to employees homes  local businesses and physicians offices  was extensive 
one of our hospitals in south carolina also suffered hurricane related damage 
we are insured for property damage and business interruption 
we have initiated the insurance claims process  and are working closely with our insurers in order to resolve and settle all hurricane related claims 
we expect that we will recover the amounts claimed  including claims for property damage and business interruption losses  subject to policy deductibles 
however  the insurance settlement process is complex and the actual results of that process could differ from our estimates 
the uninsured impact from these storms in the period amounted to approximately million in lower net income for the fourth quarter and year ended september  period compared to period the following tables summarize our results of operations for the twelve months ended september  and twelve months ended september  amount percent of revenues amount percent of revenues in thousands in thousands net patient service revenue costs and expenses salaries and benefits supplies and other provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization rent expense interest  net writeoff of deferred financing costs total costs and expenses income before minority interests and income taxes minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income twelve months ended september  change percent change same hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a total hospitals occupancy bps n a patient days admissions adjusted admissions total surgeries outpatient revenue percentage bps n a inpatient revenue percentage bps n a total hospitals at end of period basis points item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our net patient service revenue for the period  was  million as compared to  million for the period 
this represented an increase in net patient service revenue of million or approximately 
hospitals in operation for the entire period and period  which we refer to as same hospitals  provided million  or  of the increase in net patient service revenue as a result of increases in inpatient and outpatient volumes and from rate increases 
the remaining  or million  of the increase came from two hospitals we acquired in august  one hospital we acquired in september  five hospitals we acquired in november  as well as from other miscellaneous revenue 
net revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased for the period 
contributing factors to the net revenue per adjusted admission increase included rate increases  our renegotiation of managed care contracts from october  through the end of the period and increased volumes in our higher margin outpatient business 
accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net patient service revenue 
our charity care and indigent write offs were million  or of gross revenue  for the period and million  or of gross revenue  for the period 
the policy and practice at each of our hospitals is to write off a patient s entire account upon the determination that the patient qualifies under a hospital s charity care and or indigent policy 
we believe that our practice of timely recognition of charity and indigent accounts  and their subsequent write off  results in more accurate and collectible levels of accounts receivable  and correspondingly appropriate bad debt expense levels 
our bad debt policy is to reserve of all non governmental accounts receivable over days old 
we believe that our decentralized management strategy  including maintaining local business office operations in each of our hospitals  contributes greatly to our effective accounts receivable management 
our hospitals also work diligently to assist uninsured patients in the process of qualifying for medicaid  charity care  and other state and local assistance programs 
consolidated salaries and benefits increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period  primarily as a result of higher costs at the eight period and period acquisitions previously mentioned 
supplies and other costs increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period 
the majority of this increase was due to higher costs at acquired hospitals and increased supply costs related to drug eluding stents and orthopedic implants 
our provision for income taxes reflected an effective income tax rate of approximately for both the period and the period

hospitals in operation for the entire period and period  which we refer to as same hospitals  provided million  or  of the increase in net patient service revenue as a result of increases in inpatient and outpatient volumes and from rate increases 
the remaining  or million  of the increase came from one hospital we acquired in december  three hospitals we acquired in january  one hospital we acquired in may  one hospital we acquired in january  two hospitals we acquired in august and one hospital we acquired in september  as well as from other miscellaneous revenue 
net revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased for the period 
contributing factors to the net revenue per adjusted admission increase included rate increases  our renegotiation of managed care contracts from october  through the end of the period and increased volumes in our higher margin outpatient business

our hospitals also work diligently to assist uninsured patients in the process of qualifying for medicaid  charity care  and other state and local assistance programs 
consolidated salaries and benefits decreased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period  primarily as a result of a decrease in salaries at newly acquired hospitals 
supplies and other costs increased as a percent of net patient service revenue to for the period from for the period 
the majority of this increase related to higher costs at acquisition hospitals 
our provision for income taxes reflected an effective income tax rate of approximately for the period and for the period 
the rate decrease was due to a lower effective state income tax rate during the period 
liquidity  capital resources  and capital expenditures liquidity our cash flows from operations provide the primary source of funding for our ongoing cash needs 
we have historically utilized cash on hand  credit facility borrowings and proceeds from debt issuances  or a combination of the preceding  to fund acquisitions 
the following is a summary of cash flows for the twelve month periods ended september  and  respectively source use of cash flows september  in millions september  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and equivalents period cash flows compared to period cash flows operating activities our cash flows from operations increased during the period when compared to the period due primarily to our increased profitability 
the primary cause for the increase in our working capital was the increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable in the period as compared to the period resulted primarily from our period acquisitions  as receivables were not purchased by us as part of such transactions and we therefore experienced a build up in accounts receivable during the period 
days sales outstanding were down two days to days at the end of the period versus days at the end of the period 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the period consisted primarily of the cash paid for the five hospitals we acquired on november  and cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment 
these additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with three ongoing replacement hospital projects 
during the period  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the cash paid for four hospitals we acquired and cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment 
these additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with one replacement hospital project 
financing activities we also borrowed million under our line of credit agreement in the period to finance acquisitions and subsequently repaid the million from cash flows from operations during the same period 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided million which was offset by an increase in restricted funds related to our captive insurance company of million 
we also used million for payments of stock dividends 
period cash flows compared to period cash flows operating activities our cash flows from operations decreased during the period when compared to the period due to a decrease in our working capital partially offset by improved profitability 
days sales outstanding were up four days to days at the end of the period versus days at the end of the period due to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the period 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the period consisted primarily of the cash paid for the four hospitals we acquired and cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment 
these additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities and capital expenditures associated with one replacement hospital project 
during the period  cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the cash paid for five hospitals acquisitions and cash paid for additions to property  plant and equipment 
these additions consisted of renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities 
financing activities the increase in cash provided by financing activities in the period primarily resulted from the borrowings of million in connection with the issuance of the notes  offset by million in proceeds used for the repayment of our convertible senior subordinated debentures due effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to ongoing changes as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
we believe that these changes will continue to limit payment increases under these programs 
however  we do not believe that these changes will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or our liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion which may further affect payments made under those programs 
in the future  both the federal and state governments might reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and our liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care in the united states and the continued rise in managed care programs could have an effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources credit facilities on may   we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the new credit agreement expires on may  and replaced our previous million credit agreement  described below  which was due to expire in accordance with its terms on november  the new credit agreement allows us to borrow  on a revolving  unsecured basis  up to million including standby letters of credit

as of september   the interest rate for a loan based on the libor interest rate was the libor rate plus percent 
although no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement at september   the applicable libor interest rate at such time was 
as of september   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement 
we transferred all outstanding borrowings under the million credit agreement to our new million credit agreement described above on may during the term of our credit agreement in effect at september   we were obligated to pay certain commitment fees based upon amounts available to us for borrowing 
in addition  such credit facility contained covenants which  without prior consent of the lenders  limited certain of our activities  including those relating to mergers  consolidations  our ability to borrow additional money  make guarantees  grant security interests and declare dividends

on november   we further amended the indenture governing the notes to provide that in lieu of providing shares of common stock upon a conversion event  we will satisfy any conversion of the notes by making a cash payment 
capital expenditures our business strategy calls for us to continue to acquire hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria 
the acquisition of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in each of fiscal and fiscal we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospitals and other ongoing capital expenditure requirements from cash on hand generated from our operating cash flows and from availability under our credit agreement 
during the period  excess proceeds from the notes sold in july and august also provided an additional source of funding for our five hospital acquisition completed on november  transactions completed or pending for fiscal on november   we announced the execution of an agreement with bon secours health systems  inc  pursuant to which we will acquire from bon secours substantially all of the assets of the bed bon secours venice hospital  located in venice  florida  the bed bon secours st

the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near hospital property for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings and any amounts received under these subleases are offset against the expense 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
c amounts relate primarily to letters of credit outstanding with financial institutions 
the letters of credit serve as security for self insured portions of our insurance programs for payment of claims  as guarantees for the construction of replacement hospitals  and for obligations to utility companies 
d amounts relate to performance bonds that guarantee the performance of certain construction projects 
e in consideration for a physician relocating to one of our communities and agreeing to engage in private practice  our subsidiaries may advance money to the physician to assist in the establishment of the physician s practice 
the actual amount of these commitments is dependent upon the financial results of each physician s private practice during the commitment period  which generally does not exceed twelve months 
the net amounts advanced under these recruiting agreements at the end of the individual s commitment period are considered loans and are generally forgiven pro rata over a period of months contingent upon the physician continuing to practice in the respective community during such period 
our practice is to expense these advances on a straight line basis as they are paid over the commitment period 
days sales outstanding at the beginning of each fiscal year  we announce a number of financial and quality objectives for the coming fiscal year  including days sales outstanding  or dso 
our dso is calculated by dividing the quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to obtain the dso 
this statistic is an important measure of collection of our accounts receivable 
below is a table of actual days compared to our objectives 
september  actual days sales outstanding objective for days sales outstanding the variance from fiscal and our fiscal objective resulted from the acquisitions we completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal at september  we were in the process of transferring medicare and medicaid provider numbers for these acquired hospitals 
until provider numbers were transferred  these hospitals continued to treat patients under the medicare and medicaid programs  but were unable to bill medicare and medicaid 
once we transferred these provider numbers  we were able to bill for all medicare and medicaid patients previously treated 
this contributed days of the day increase 
net of such acquisitions  our dso for fiscal would have been days 
our pulse system provides a daily aging of our outstanding accounts receivable 
the primary uses of this aging are to manage and evaluate the collectibility of our receivables and calculate the adequacy of allowances 
our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage as well as those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of the bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the specific plan in which the patient participates 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as each hospital s policies for indigent care 
after payment is received from a third party  if any  statements are sent indicating the outstanding balance on the account 
if the account is still outstanding after a period of time  the account is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection to include contact with the patient via mail and phone 
the purpose of this process is to work with the patient to resolve the outstanding debt 
all non governmental accounts over days old from date of discharge are reserved for in our allowance for bad debts 
the following table presents an aging of our gross prior to allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts discharged and billed accounts receivable september  in thousands days days and over days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others private pay total gross discharged accounts receivable we have historically and consistently used the day threshold for establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our financial statements have been consistently prepared and presented by the application of this policy 
while we do consistently apply the day policy  we utilize other quantitative and qualitative factors to analyze the propriety of this policy and the adequacy of the reserves established under this policy 
the principal quantitative factor is a comparison of net revenues to cash collections 
we analyze this statistic monthly and quarterly to validate our estimation of both deductions from revenue and provision for bad debts 
the primary qualitative factors used include analyzing days sales outstanding  bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross accounts receivable 
all of these factors and others are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for developing trends in the accounts receivable portfolio 
we believe that virtually all accounts identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing  that are aged days and earlier  will not convert to private pay 
as the accounts age into the older aging buckets  there is the likelihood that a small percentage of those accounts will convert to private pay upon denials from third party payors 
however  accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for denial potential and are reclassified accordingly 
impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we typically experience such seasonal volume and revenue peaks because more people generally become ill during the winter months  which in turn results in significant increases in the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and is subject to wage and other expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when shortages of skilled labor occur 
there is currently a shortage of skilled nursing staff industry wide  which has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed the nursing staff needs in our markets by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions  and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our net income 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
thus far  we believe that we have been able to offset increases in our operating costs through a combination of increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases under our group purchasing agreement  and by more efficient utilization of resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs and expenses  we cannot predict our ability to cover or offset future cost increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of our million credit agreement that has an interest rate subject to market fluctuations 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt 
the following table summarizes principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
at september  the fair value of our fixed rate debt was million  while the carrying value was approximately million 
at september  the fair value of our variable rate debt was million  while the carrying value was approximately million 
thereafter total in millions  except interest rates long term debt fixed rate long term debt  including capital leases average interest rates fixed rate convertible long term debt a average interest rate variable rate long term debt average interest rate the interest rate is libor plus 
the interest rate on the outstanding balance at september  was 
a holders of the notes and notes are able to put the notes to us at various predetermined dates throughout the period from for purposes of this table  we have assumed that expected maturities will equal scheduled maturities
