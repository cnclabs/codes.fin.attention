item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts overview we are the largest private source of funding  delivery and servicing support for education loans in the united states primarily through our participation in the ffelp 
our primary business is to originate  acquire and hold student loans 
we also provide a wide range of financial services  processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions  lenders  students and their families  and guarantee agencies 
we earn fees for student loan servicing  guarantee processing  student loan default management and loan collections 
slm corporation is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries including the student loan marketing association  a federally chartered government sponsored enterprise 
references in this annual report to the company refer to slm corporation and its subsidiaries 
we have provided the discussion of the gse within the context of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a because the gse s primary function of financing the initial purchase of student loans is a subset of similar operations conducted by the company 
as we wind down the gse  such operations will constitute less and less of the company s operations 
md a disclosures applicable solely to the gse are included at the end of this md a in the section titled student loan marketing association 
the discussion that follows regarding our interest income and expenses from on balance sheet assets and liabilities is applicable to both the company and the gse 
likewise  because all of our ffelp securitizations to date have originated from the gse  the discussion of securitization gains for ffelp student loans is applicable to the gse only 
the ongoing servicing and securitization revenue from those securitizations is primarily earned by the company because the retained interests in ffelp securitizations are sold by the gse to slm corporation shortly after completion of the securitization transaction 
discussions of private credit student loan securitizations are applicable to the company only 
the discussions of off balance sheet loans  our fee based businesses  and our operations on a managed basis  as well as the discussions set forth below under the headings selected financial data  other income  federal and state taxes and alternative performance measures do not involve the gse and relate to the company on a consolidated basis 
in  the majority of our student loan purchases were financed in the gse and were initially financed through the issuance of short term gse debt obligations and then through student loan securitizations that were conducted through the gse 
once securitized  the gse no longer owns the student loans and the bonds issued by the trust are not obligations of the gse 
as the wind down of the gse continues  the liquidity provided to the company by the gse is being replaced by non gse financing  including securitizations originated by non gse subsidiaries of slm corporation 
all student loans that the company directly originates are owned by non gse subsidiaries from inception 
the gse has no employees  so the management of its operations is provided by the company under a management services agreement 
we also service the majority of the gse s student loans under a servicing agreement between the gse and sallie mae  inc  a wholly owned non gse subsidiary of slm corporation which includes the division of sallie mae servicing 
see student loan marketing association privatization act gse wind down for a more detailed discussion of the gse and the progress of the company s wind down effort 
executive summary we have built the company to be the dominant player in every phase of the student loan life cycle from origination of the student loans to servicing the student loans to debt management of delinquent and ultimately defaulted student loans 
as the leading company in our industry  we are positioned to meet the growing demand for post secondary education credit across and related services 
we have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain this leadership position 
we now have the largest and most successful sales force in the industry  which is positioned to deliver our product offerings on campus 
the core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands  which generate student loan originations through our preferred channel 
loans acquired through our preferred channel are more profitable than loans acquired through our forward purchase commitments or the spot market since they are acquired earlier in the student loan s life and we generally pay lower premiums to acquire such loans 
we have built brand leadership between the sallie mae name and those of our leading lender partners  bank one and jp morgan chase  such that we capture the volume of three of the top five originators of ffelp loans 
these sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most technologically advanced servicing capabilities in the industry  providing an unmatched array of servicing capability to financial aid offices 
demand for post secondary education in the united states has grown steadily over the last decade and we expect this growth rate to continue in the future 
the doe predicts that the college age population will increase to percent by demand for education credit will be further increased by more non traditional students those not attending college directly from high school and adult education 
in addition  tuition costs have risen percent for four year public institutions and percent for four year private institutions on an inflation adjusted basis since the academic year 
management believes that the twin factors of increasing demand for education coupled with rising tuition costs will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade 
in  we acquired billion of student loans  a percent increase over the billion acquired in of the student loans acquired  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion of student loans originated in the main driver of our earnings continues to be our managed portfolio of student loans  which in  grew by percent to billion at december  ffelp student loans are percent guaranteed by the federal government and as such represent high quality assets with very little credit risk and predictable earnings streams that are relatively easily financed 
at december   our managed ffelp student loan portfolio was billion or percent of total managed student loans 
ffelp loan limits have not been raised since  so to meet the increasing cost of higher education  students have had to turn to alternative sources of education financing 
a large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided through campus based private credit student loans  of which we are the largest provider 
at december   we owned billion of private credit student loans representing percent of our managed student loan portfolio 
this portfolio grew by percent in private credit student loans consist of two general types those that are designed to bridge the gap between the cost of higher education and the amount financed through capped federally insured loans and the borrowers resources  and those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training  distance learning and lifelong learning programs 
unlike ffelp loans  private credit student loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower 
we manage this additional risk through industry tested loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk 
as a result  we earn much higher spreads on private credit student loans than on ffelp loans 
we believe that they are an important driver of future earnings growth 
the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans will drive future earnings growth only if we maintain the student loan spread earned on those loans 
as we continue to wind down the gse  the cost of funding our managed student loan portfolio will increase as we replace gse funding with higher cost non gse funding sources 
the increased funding costs coupled with the rapid growth in consolidation loans puts pressure on our student loan spread 
we have actively managed these adverse effects by acquiring a higher percentage of student loans through our preferred channel and by the increasing percentage of private credit student loans in our managed portfolio 
the managed student loan spread for the years ended december  and  exclusive of floor income and changes in estimates  was percent and percent  respectively 
in recent years  the managed spread has also benefited from floor income contracts 
while student loans remain the core of our business  we are committed to extending and diversifying our business in higher education related fee based services  primarily guarantor servicing  debt management services  and loan servicing 
for  these businesses generated percent of net revenues net interest income plus other income on a managed basis  up from percent in in total  the debt management businesses generated gross revenue of million in  an increase of percent from the million earned in  and guarantor servicing fees increased by percent to million in versus million in the growth in these businesses has also increased operating expenses at approximately the same rate 
we are committed to expanding these businesses further both through internal business development and selective strategic acquisitions 
our biggest funding challenge in winding down the gse is to maintain cost effective liquidity and access to the capital markets as we transition from gse funding to slm corporation non gse funding 
the main source of non gse funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid and deep market for such financings as evidenced by the over billion of student loans securitized in sixteen transactions in versus billion in nine transactions in while the growth in our securitizations was very important to the gse wind down plan  equally as important was the myriad of new unsecured non gse short and long term funding vehicles that we introduced in we issued almost billion of slm corporation  term  non gse unsecured debt in which increased the balance of such debt to billion at december   a percent increase over december  this shift in funding was accomplished through the introduction of several new funding programs that further diversified our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base 
we believe that the record volume of non gse financing  which  combined with securitization  equaled times our student acquisitions in  is indicative of our ability to successfully finance the company in a post gse environment 
at december   we financed percent of our managed student loans with non gse sources versus percent at december  we face a number of challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in applicable laws and regulations  which may change the volume  average term  effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the ffelp or provide advantages to competing feelp and non ffelp loan providers  demand and competition for education financing  financing preferences of students and their families  borrower default rates on privately insured loans  prepayment rates on student loans  particularly prepayments through loan consolidation  access to the capital markets for non gse funding at favorable spreads  and our operating execution and efficiencies  including errors  omissions  and breakdowns in internal control 
critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  particularly those that include the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below securitization accounting and retained interests  provision for loan losses  and derivative accounting 
also  as part of our regular quarterly evaluation of the critical estimates used by the company  we have updated a number of estimates to account for the increase in consolidation loan activity 
effects of consolidation loan activity on estimates the combination of aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and low interest rates has led to record levels of consolidation loan volume  which  in turn  had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates 
as long as interest rates remain at historically low levels  and absent any changes in the hea  we expect the consolidation loan program to continue to be an attractive option for borrowers 
accordingly  we updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by consolidation loan activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts  borrower benefits  residual interest income and the valuation of the residual interest 
loan consolidation activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original ffelp stafford loans being consolidated are on or off balance sheet and whether the resulting consolidation loan is retained by us or consolidated with a third party 
when we consolidate a ffelp stafford loan that was in our portfolio  the term of that loan is extended and the term of the amortization is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan 
in that process the capitalized acquisition costs premium must be adjusted from inception to reflect the new term of the consolidated loan 
the following schedule summarizes the impact of loan consolidation on each affected financial statement line item 
see also net interest income student loans and other income servicing and securitization revenue for financial results of these changes 
effect of increasing consolidation activity on balance sheet student loans estimate consolidating lender effect on estimate cpr accounting effect premium sallie mae term extension decrease estimate adjustment increase unamortized balance of premium 
reduced annual amortization expense going forward

borrower benefits sallie mae term extension n a original expected benefit expense reversed new lower benefit amortized over a longer term 
borrower benefits other lenders stafford loan sold n a original expected benefit revised to reflect lower consolidation loan benefit and the longer average life 
off balance sheet student loans estimate consolidating lender effect on estimate cpr accounting effect residual interest sallie mae or other lenders ffelp stafford loan is sold from trust reduced term increase reduction in fair market value of residual interest asset resulting in impairment charge or reduction in prior market value gains recorded in other comprehensive income 
decrease in prospective effective yield used to recognize interest income 
as estimates are updated  the premium balance must be adjusted from inception to reflect the new expected term of the loan 
consolidation loans in securitizations the estimate of the cpr also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation estimate of the residual interest 
prepayments shorten the average life of the trust  and if all other factors remain equal  will reduce the value of the residual interest asset  the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income 
prepayments on student loans in securitized trusts are primarily driven by the rate at which securitized ffelp loans are consolidated 
when a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party  the loan is repurchased from the trust and is treated as a prepayment 
in cases where the loan is consolidated by us  it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset 
securitization accounting and retained interests we regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy 
as described in more detail in other income servicing and securitization revenue  in a securitization we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction 
when our securitizations meet the sale criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
 we record a gain on the sale of the student loans which includes using a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the fair value of the retained interest 
the retained interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
since there are no quoted market prices for our retained interests  we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans  which can be impacted by the forward yield curve  the calculation of the embedded floor income associated with the securitized loan portfolio see below  the cpr  the discount rate used to calculate the residual interest commensurate with the risks involved  and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio 
we earn interest income and periodically evaluate our retained interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
under this standard  on a quarterly basis we estimate the cash flows to be received from our retained interests and these revised cash flows are used prospectively to calculate a yield for income recognition 
in cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a decrease in the yield used to recognize interest income compared to the prior quarter  the retained interest is written down to fair value  first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income  then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment 
these estimates are the same as those used for the valuation of the residual interest discussed above 
we also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts 
we assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in sfas no 
to the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation  no servicing asset or obligation is recorded 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the student loan portfolios 
the allowance for private credit student loan losses is an estimate of losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date that will be charged off in subsequent periods 
we estimate our losses using historical data from our private credit student loan portfolios  extrapolations of ffelp loan loss data  current trends and relevant industry information 
as our private credit student loan portfolios continue to mature  more reliance is placed on our own historic private credit student loan charge off and recovery data 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter  we updated our expected default assumptions to further align the allowance estimate with our collection experience and the terms and policies of the individual private credit student loan programs 
we use this data in internally developed models to estimate the amount of losses  net of subsequent collections  projected to occur in the private credit student loan portfolios 
when calculating the private credit student loan loss reserve  we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type  underwriting criteria  existence or absence of a co borrower  repayment begin date and repayment status 
we then apply default and collection rate projections to each category 
the repayment begin date indicates when the borrower is required to begin repaying their loan 
our career training private credit student loan programs percent of the managed private credit student loan portfolio at december  generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loan immediately 
our higher education private credit student loan programs percent of the managed private credit student loan portfolio at december  do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school 
consequently  our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school 
at december   percent of the principal balance in the higher education managed private credit student loan portfolio relates to borrowers who are still in school not required to make payments 
as the current portfolio ages  an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans 
the allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment 
our loss estimates include losses to be incurred over the loss confirmation period  which is the period of the highest concentration of defaults 
the loss confirmation period is two years for career training loans beginning when the loan is originated and five years for higher education loans beginning when the borrower leaves school  similar to the rules governing ffelp payment requirements 
our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations typically  very early in the repayment term when they are starting their career 
this is referred to as forbearance status see net interest income student loans delinquencies 
at december   percent of the managed private credit student loan portfolio was in forbearance status 
the loss confirmation period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and considers these periods of nonpayment 
private credit student loan principal and accrued interest is charged off against the allowance at days delinquency 
private credit student loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and removed from the active portfolio 
recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the allowance 
accordingly  the evaluation of the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio 
derivative accounting we use interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate futures contracts  floor income contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments 
we account for these instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
we determine the fair value for our derivative instruments using pricing models that consider current market values and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
as a matter of policy  we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis 
any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately 
we make certain judgments in the application of hedge accounting under sfas no 
the most significant judgment relates to the application of hedge accounting in connection with our forecasted debt issuances 
under sfas no 
 if the forecasted transaction is probable to occur then hedge accounting may be applied 
we regularly update our probability assessment related to such forecasted debt issuances 
this assessment includes analyzing prior debt issuances and assessing changes in our future funding strategies 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
we believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  under sfas no 
 some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  eurodollar futures contracts  certain basis swaps and equity forwards  do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
therefore  changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the derivative market value adjustment in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment

requires net settlement income expense on derivatives and realized gains losses related to derivative dispositions that do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
to be included in the derivative market value adjustment on the income statement 
in response to this interpretation  we believe that it is helpful to the understanding of our business to include two presentations of net interest income and net interest margin 
the first is a gaap presentation that includes the net settlement income expense on derivatives and realized gains losses in the derivative market value adjustment line and thus does not include these items in net interest income or the net interest margin 
the second is a non gaap presentation that assumes that these net settlements have been reclassified to the financial statement line item of the economically hedged item  which then includes them in the net interest income and margin 
we believe that this second presentation is meaningful and reflects how management manages interest rate risk through the match funding of interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the presentations of our taxable equivalent net interest income  average balance sheet  rate volume analysis  student loan spread and funding costs in the following tables will reflect these reclassifications

taxable equivalent interest income interest expense taxable equivalent net interest income  non gaap taxable equivalent net interest income after reclassification for versus decreased by million while the net interest margin decreased by basis points 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in floor income and other student loan spread related items as discussed under student loans student loan spread analysis 
the decrease in the net interest margin was also due to the increase in lower yielding short term investments caused by the increase in non gse funding that is temporarily being held pending future asset transfers from the gse to slm holding 
the net interest margin was also negatively impacted by the increase in student loan securitizations because the retained interest asset earns securitization income instead of net interest income while being funded by interest bearing liabilities 
taxable equivalent net interest income after reclassification for versus increased by million while the net interest margin increased by basis points 
the increase in taxable equivalent net interest income was primarily due to the lower interest rate environment in  which led to an increase of million in floor income  and the billion increase in the average balance of student loans 
the increase in the net interest margin reflects the higher average balance of student loans as a percentage of average total earning assets  the increase in floor income  and the increased proportion of higher yielding private credit student loans 
student loans for both federally insured and private credit student loans  we account for premiums paid  discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the acquisition of student loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts  as well as borrower incentive programs 
origination fees charged on private credit student loans are deferred and amortized to income over the lives of the student loans 
in the table below  this amortization is netted with the amortization of the premiums

in response to the increase in consolidation loan activity  we decreased the cpr for ffelp stafford loans to reflect the extension of the term of these loans when consolidated into a sallie mae consolidation loan  which increased the unamortized student loan premium and decreased premium amortization 
at the same time  we increased the cpr for the consolidation loan portfolio  which had the opposite effect on the premium balance and premium amortization 
the on balance sheet portfolio of consolidation loans now constitutes percent of the ffelp student loan portfolio and  as a result  the change in the cpr estimate for consolidation loans had a greater effect than on the managed portfolio 
the net effect of the two changes in estimate was a million estimate adjustment to decrease the unamortized student loan premium and to increase current period amortization expense 
consolidation loan activity also affects the effective interest calculation of our borrower benefits programs 
when a student loan consolidates  the borrower is no longer eligible for the ffelp stafford borrower benefit  but is eligible for a lower consolidation loan benefit 
based on higher projected rates of consolidation  we reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for ffelp stafford borrower benefits 
this change in estimate resulted in a million estimate adjustment to reduce the estimated borrower benefit liability and increase student loan income 
we also projected that our private credit student loan portfolio is amortizing slower than previously anticipated and we therefore increased the average term of private credit student loans in connection with the calculation of the amortization of the student loan discount 
this resulted in a million estimate adjustment to increase the balance of the unamortized student loan discount and to decrease current period discount amortization 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates was a million or basis points reduction in the student loan spread 
discussion of on balance sheet student loan spread exclusive of floor income and changes in accounting estimates the decrease in the student loan spread  exclusive of floor income and updated estimates discussed above  versus the student loan spread was primarily due to higher spreads on our debt funding student loans and the increase in the average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio 
the increase in the spreads on the cost of funds is due to the replacement of lower cost gse funding with non gse funding in connection with the gse wind down 
this higher cost is the result of both higher credit spreads on non gse funding sources and the significantly longer duration of non gse liabilities 
also  we use higher cost  longer term debt to fund consolidation loans 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in consolidation loans have lower spreads due to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee  which is partially offset by the absence of the basis point offset fee on gse student loans  higher sap yield and lower student loan premium amortization 
the student loan spread  exclusive of floor income  increased by basis points from to this increase was due primarily to lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans through lower funding spreads and through the refinancing of some higher rate debt  and to an increase in private credit student loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio 
these loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads 
these positive effects were offset by the continued growth in our consolidation loans  which are lower yielding due mainly to the consolidation loan rebate fee 
floor income for on balance sheet student loans  floor income is included in student loan income

the increase in variable rate floor income for the year ended december  versus was largely driven by higher average interest rates in  such that minimal variable rate floor income was earned in the first half of the increase in fixed rate floor income in versus was due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans earning fixed rate floor income

during the third quarter of  we reclassified these uninsured ffelp student loans and the related reserves to the private credit student loan portfolio 
in the above table  the reclassification is reflected for all periods presented 
the increase in the provision for private credit student loans of million from to is primarily due to the increase in private credit student loans entering repayment prior to being securitized over the prior year 
for the year ended december   private credit student loan charge offs increased by million over the prior year  which is due to the increase in securitization activity as we primarily securitize loans that are current leaving a higher percentage of delinquent loans on balance sheet and to the increase of career training loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio 
the million increase in the provision for private credit student loans from to was primarily due to a reclassification in related to a change in presentation for student loan discounts discussed below  to the percent increase in the volume of private credit student loans in versus  and to the continued aging of the portfolio 
we charge the borrower fees on private credit student loans  both at origination and when the loan enters repayment 
such fees are deferred and recognized into income as a component of interest over the average life of the related pool of loans 
these fees are charged to compensate for anticipated loan losses and  prior to  we reflected the unamortized balance of these fees as a component of the allowance for loan losses

additionally  the forbearance balance at december  includes million of career training loans in closed school status  whose ultimate disposition is uncertain 
the period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due 
the increase in delinquent loans in the on balance sheet portfolio is primarily due to the increase in career training loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet private credit student loan portfolio as all private credit student loan securitizations to date have been of higher education private credit student loans 
career training loans enter repayment immediately  have a higher risk profile and less flexible repayment alternatives

the million increase in mortgage and consumer loan gains from to is mainly attributed to an increase in gains on sales of mortgage loans due to the acquisition of pioneer mortgage in the second quarter of and to the strong market for mortgage refinancings due to historically low interest rates

effects of sfas no 
derivative accounting sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
we believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges and they are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  under sfas no 
 some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  eurodollar futures contracts  certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts discussed in detail below  do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
and the standalone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility and changing credit spreads during the period and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment 
core cash earnings exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the one sided derivative valuations  and recognize the economic effect of these hedges  which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item s life 
our floor income contracts are written options 
sfas no 
s hedge criteria regarding effectiveness when using written options is more stringent than other hedging relationships 
because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the floor income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written floor income contracts  the written floor income contracts do not qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
the floor income contracts effectively fix the amount of floor income we will earn over the contract period  thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty associated with floor income for that period 
prior to sfas no 
 we accounted for floor income contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts 
under sfas no 
 the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract 
the change in the value of floor income contracts is caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of floor income earned on the underlying student loans and transferred to the counterparties to vary 
the change in the market value of the floor income contracts is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio earning floor income  but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under sfas no 
basis swaps are used to convert the floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt 
we primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and libor based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to commercial paper or the treasury bill 
sfas no 
requires that the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability 
our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk and do not meet this effectiveness test because student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates 
we also have basis swaps that do not meet the sfas no 
effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments 
as a result  these swaps are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in value reflected in the income statement 
generally  a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written floor income contracts and eurodollar futures contracts 
related to our basis swaps  if the two underlying indexes and related forward curve do not move in parallel we will experience unrealized gains losses 
in addition  under sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the company s stock are required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as derivatives 
as a result  we now account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
and mark them to market through earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 equity forward contracts that were entered into prior to june  and outstanding at july   were marked to market on july  which resulted in a million gain that was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income 
alternative performance measures in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management  credit rating agencies  lenders and analysts also evaluate the company on certain non gaap performance measures that we refer to as core cash measures 
while core cash measures are not a substitute for reported results under gaap  we rely on core cash measures in operating our business because we believe they provide additional information on the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
we report pro forma core cash measures  which is the primary financial performance measure used by management not only in developing the financial plans and tracking results  but also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation 
management also relies on several other non gaap performance measures related to core cash measures to evaluate the company s performance 
our core cash measures are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
core cash measures reflect only current period adjustments to gaap as described below 
accordingly  the company s core cash measures presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and core cash measures follows 
securitization under gaap  certain securitization transactions are accounted for as sales of assets 
under core cash  we present all securitization transactions as long term non recourse financings 
the upfront gains on sale from securitization as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented by gaap are excluded from core cash and replaced by the interest income  provision for loan losses  and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitized loans 
floor income the timing and amount if any of floor income earned is uncertain and in excess of expected spreads and  therefore  we exclude such income when it is not economically hedged from core cash measures 
we employ derivatives  primarily floor income contracts and futures  to economically hedge floor income 
as discussed under effects of sfas no 
derivative accounting  these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges and therefore are marked to market through the derivative market value adjustment 
for core cash measures  we reverse the fair value adjustments on the floor income contracts and include the amortization of net premiums received in income 
since we exclude floor income that is not economically hedged  we also exclude net settlements on derivative contracts  amortization of certain derivative gains and losses  and gains and losses on sales of securities on financial instruments that were economically hedging floor income 
the following table summarizes the floor income adjustments for the years ended december   and years ended december  core cash floor income adjustments floor income earned on managed loans amortization of net premiums on floor income contracts and futures in net interest income closed eurodollar futures contracts economically hedging floor income in net interest income losses on sales of derivatives hedging floor income total core cash floor income adjustments derivative accounting core cash measures exclude the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by sfas no 
and recognize the economic effect of these hedges  which results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item s life 
see also effects of sfas no

we also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts including the gain recorded upon the adoption of sfas no 
that was recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change

student loan spread analysis managed basis the following table analyzes the student loan spread  exclusive of floor income  from our portfolio of managed student loans for the years ended december   and years ended december  managed student loan yields  before floor income consolidation loan rebate fees 


offset fees 


borrower benefits 


premium and origination fee amortization 


managed basis student loan net yield managed basis student loan cost of funds managed basis student loan spread average balances managed student loans accounting estimates effect on the student loan spread as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates effects of consolidation loan activity and net interest income student loans accounting estimates effect on the on balance sheet student loan spread  the high rate of consolidation loan activity affects the estimates for capitalizing and amortizing student loan premiums and discounts and borrower benefits 
in response to the increase in consolidation loan activity  we decreased the cpr for ffelp stafford loans to reflect the extension of the term of these loans when consolidated  which increased the unamortized student loan premium and decreased premium amortization 
at the same time  we increased the cpr for the consolidation loan portfolio  which had the opposite effect on the premium balance and premium amortization 
the net effect of this activity was a million estimate adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium and reduce current period amortization expense for the managed portfolio 
for the managed portfolio  the effect of consolidation loan activity resulted in an increase in the premium whereas the effect on balance sheet was a million decrease in premium 
this was primarily due to consolidation loans making up percent of the on balance sheet ffelp portfolio versus percent of the managed portfolio 
also  the portfolio of ffelp stafford loans on balance sheet includes a greater percentage of newly acquired loans that have had little amortization and as a result any adjustment to reflect changes in estimates would be much less if all other factors remained equal 
when a stafford loan borrower consolidates  they forfeit the borrower benefit program offered on stafford loans 
as a result  we also reduced our estimate of the number of borrowers who eventually qualify for borrower benefits to reflect the loss in borrower benefits from the increase in consolidations 
this resulted in an estimate adjustment of million  recorded as a decrease in the estimated borrower benefit liability and an increase in student loan income 
as our private credit student loan portfolio matures  we have more historic data  which we used to analyze the speed at which our private credit portfolio amortizes 
based on this review  we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts as a component of our managed private credit student loan portfolio 
the increase in the average term of private credit student loans resulted in a million estimate adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan discount and decrease current period discount amortization income 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates was a million or basis point increase in the managed student loan spread 
discussion of student loan spread exclusive of changes in accounting estimates the increase in the student loan spread exclusive of floor income and the estimate adjustments discussed above versus was primarily due to the lower premium amortization caused by the longer average lives of consolidation loans  the increase in the percentage of private credit student loans in the managed student loan portfolio partially offset by the higher spreads on the cost of funds  and the increase of consolidation loans as a percentage of the total portfolio 
the spreads on the cost of funds increased as we continue to replace gse funding with non gse funding in connection with the gse wind down 
we estimate that the increase in funding outside of the gse reduced the managed student loan spread by basis points in and project that it will further reduce the spread by approximately to basis points upon completion of the wind down 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average managed ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in the negative effect of consolidation loans on the managed student loan spread is driven by the same factors as the on balance sheet student loan spread  which is discussed in more detail at net interest income discussion of on balance sheet student loan spread exclusive of floor income and changes in accounting estimates 
these negatives were offset by the increase in the average balance of managed private credit student loans as a percentage of the average managed student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in these loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which average percent for the managed private credit student loan portfolio versus a spread of percent for the managed guaranteed student loan portfolio before floor income and the estimate adjustment 
private credit student loans now comprise percent of our managed student loan portfolio at december   up from percent at december  the increase in the managed student loan spread from to was mainly due to the increase in the percentage of private credit student loans in the managed student loan portfolio  partially offset by the growth in consolidation loans 
the managed student loan spread also benefited from lower funding costs for on balance sheet loans achieved through the refinancing of some higher rate debt that was funding student loans 
losses on such refinancings are included in losses on sales of securities in other income

during the third quarter of  we reclassified these uninsured ffelp student loans to private credit student loans and also reclassified the related reserves 
in the above table this reclassification is reflected for all periods presented 
the increase in the provision for private credit student loans of million from to is primarily due to the million increase in managed private credit student loans entering repayment over the prior year 
for the year ended december   private credit student loan charge offs increased by million over the prior year  which is due primarily to the percent increase in managed private credit student loans in repayment  however  charge offs as a percentage of average managed private credit student loans in repayment decreased to percent from percent

acquisitions on november   we acquired ams 
we accounted for this transaction under the purchase method of accounting as defined in sfas no 
 business combinations  and allocated the purchase price primarily to the billion student loan portfolio and intangible assets including goodwill 
in addition to the student loan portfolio  the purchase will expand our loan origination capability and enhance our offerings to college and university business offices 
in addition to the ams acquisition  we acquired several other companies during  and  which were not significant to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting as defined in apb no 
or sfas no 
depending on the date of acquisition 
the results of operations of the acquired companies were included prospectively from the date of acquisition and the acquisition cost was allocated to the acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on fair values at the date of acquisition 
residual amounts were recorded as goodwill 
in process research and development write offs have been insignificant 
unaudited pro forma statement of operations information has not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions were not material on either an individual or aggregated basis 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan and we have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to the capital markets as we transition from gse funding to slm corporation non gse funding 
our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans as well as refinancing previously securitized loans when consolidated back on balance sheet 
at the same time we must maintain earnings spreads and control interest rate risk to preserve earnings growth 
the main source of non gse funding is student loan securitizations and in we had a record year in volume  securitizing over billion in student loans in sixteen transactions versus billion in nine transactions in our securitizations backed by ffelp loans are unique securities in the asset backed class as they are backed by student loans with an explicit guarantee on percent of principal and interest 
this guarantee is subject to service compliance  but is not related to the company s gse subsidiary 
at december   we financed percent of our managed student loans from non gse sources versus percent at december  as evidenced by the volume  we have built a highly liquid and deep market for student loan securitizations by broadening our investor base worldwide 
securitizations will continue to grow and are expected to comprise approximately percent of total managed debt by  versus percent at december  in addition to securitizations  we also significantly increased and diversified other non gse financing through the issuance of almost billion in slm corporation  term  unsecured non gse debt 
we strategically introduced several new non gse long term issuances in to further diversify our funding sources and substantially increase our fixed income investor base 
in total  at december   non gse on balance sheet debt  exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations  totaled billion  a percent increase over december  in addition to liquidity  a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk through match funding of our assets and liabilities 
generally  on a pooled basis to the extent practicable  we match the interest rate and reset characteristics of our managed assets and liabilities 
in this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
this interest rate risk management helps us to achieve a stable student loan spread irrespective of the interest rate environment

the convertible debentures bear interest at a floating rate equal to three month libor minus 
percent  until july   after which the debentures can pay additional contingent interest under certain circumstances 
beginning on july   we may call the debentures and the investors may put the debentures  subject to certain conditions 
in the convertible debentures potentially could be dilutive to earnings per share  which would be calculated using the if converted method 
in the second quarter of  we issued million of euro denominated debt under our euro medium term note program 
the debt matures in july and pays interest at a fixed rate of percent 
concurrently with the issuance of the euro debt  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap which converts i all euro denominated fixed rate interest payments on the debt into dollar denominated variable rate month libor interest payments  ii initial net proceeds of this issuance into us dollars and iii the principal maturity payment amount of million to million which was the face amount of the issuance 
through the use of the cross currency swap agreement  we intend to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk on this transaction 
in the second quarter of  we issued billion of extendible notes that pay a variable rate of interest of month libor plus an escalating spread 
the initial maturity date of the notes is may every month  beginning the month after the date of issuance  the noteholders have the option to extend the note s maturity date to a date months from the date the noteholder makes such an extension election 
if the noteholder fails to extend his notes  those notes will be due months after that failure to extend 
in  we expanded our securitization investor base internationally by issuing billion of euro and sterling denominated trust debt 
in the third quarter of  we amended the terms of our domestic medium term note program to increase the amount that can be issued thereunder by billion 
in  we raised over billion in term  unsecured  non gse debt from retail individual investors 
included in this amount was million in notes linked to the consumer price index cpi  further diversifying our funding sources 
gse financing activities the gse secures financing to fund its on balance sheet portfolio of student loans  along with its other operations  by issuing debt securities in the domestic and overseas capital markets  through public offerings and private placements of us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated debt of varying maturities and interest rate characteristics 
the gse s debt securities are currently rated at the highest credit rating level by both moody s and s p 
historically  the rating agencies ratings of the gse have been largely a factor of its status as a government sponsored enterprise 
since the privatization act did not modify the attributes of debt issued by the gse  management anticipates that the gse will retain its current credit ratings 
the gse s unsecured financing requirements are driven by the following factors liquidity to meet the short term funding of new student loan acquisitions  refinancing of existing gse liabilities as they mature and are not replaced by non gse funding sources  the level of securitization activity  and the transfer and refinancing of gse assets by non gse entities of the company 
non gse unsecured on balance sheet financing activities the following table shows the senior unsecured credit ratings on our non gse debt from the major rating agencies

by using a two step transaction with a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that legally isolates the transferred assets from the company  even in the event of bankruptcy  and are accounted for off balance sheet 
each of these transactions is structured to ensure that the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the qspe are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests  and that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
in all of our off balance sheet securitizations  we retain the right to receive the cash flows from the securitized student loans in excess of cash flows needed to pay interest and principal on the bonds issued by the trust and servicing and administration fees 
prior to  all of our securitization structures were off balance sheet transactions 
in certain consolidation loan securitization structures  we hold certain rights that can affect the remarketing of the bonds as well as a call option that gives us the right to acquire certain of the notes issued in the transaction 
thus we are deemed to maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
as a result  these securitizations do not meet the criteria of being a qspe and are accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities vies 
these securitization structures were developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for consolidation loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with non amortizing  fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches 
the following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended december   and years ended december  number of transactions amount securitized gain number of transactions amount securitized gain number of transactions amount securitized gain ffelp stafford plus loans   
consolidation loans   private credit student loans  total securitization sales   on balance sheet consolidation loan vies  total loans securitized    the increase in the gains as a percentage of loans securitized in versus and is mainly due to the securitization of consolidation loans which have higher embedded fixed rate floor income and the securitization of private credit student loans which have higher relative student loan spreads compared to ffelp stafford loan securitizations 
at december  and  securitized student loans outstanding totaled billion and billion  respectively 
at december  and  we held in our investment portfolio million and billion  respectively  of asset backed securities issued by our securitization trusts 
we purchased these securities in the secondary market 
our asset backed securities generally have a higher net cost to fund our student loans than our gse on balance sheet financing because the asset backed securities are term match funded to the assets securitized and do not benefit from the implicit guarantee of the federal government that investors attribute to gse debt 
the gse s funding advantage over our securitizations is somewhat mitigated by the absence of offset fees on securitized loans 
our securitizations to date have been structured to achieve a triple aaa credit rating on over percent of the asset backed securities sold 
securities issued in our typical ffelp student loan securitizations are issued with a variety of interest rate terms and in multiple currencies while the index on our securitized loans are either indexed to the day or week treasury bill or commercial paper 
we manage this off balance sheet interest rate and currency risk through trust and on balance sheet financing activities  principally interest rate and currency swaps 
in  we expect to maintain the level of securitization activity to fund new student loan purchases and continue the refinancing of gse debt 
liquidity risk as non gse financing replaces gse funding and becomes an ever larger percentage of our long term funding  our credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets shifts from the agency capital markets to the corporate and asset backed markets 
a major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans  or on our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the gse wind down 
our securitizations are structured such that we do not provide any level of financial  credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts and our exposure is limited to the recovery of the retained interest asset on the balance sheet 
our retained interests are subject to prepayment risk primarily from consolidating loans that could materially impair their value 
our ffelp securitizations have minimal credit and interest rate risk and as a result  outside of the prepayment risk  we believe that  even in times of great stress in the capital markets  the likelihood is remote that any of these off balance sheet arrangements could be impaired to the point at which they could result in a material adverse impact on the company 
retained interest on securitized loans the residual interest plus any reserve or cash accounts constitute the retained interest asset on balance sheet 
the retained interests are recorded at fair value at the time of sale and each subsequent quarter using a discounted cash flow analysis 
at december  and  the fair value of the retained interest was billion and billion  respectively 
the average balance of the retained interest for the years ended december   and was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
accounting estimates effect on the residual interest in securitized trust as discussed in detail under critical accounting policies and estimates effects of consolidation loan activity  there have been record levels of consolidation loan volume for the past two years that have a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates including the initial and subsequent valuations of the residual interest 
as part of our ongoing evaluation of our critical estimates  we increased the cpr rate used to value the residual interest to reflect the increase in expected prepayments of trust ffelp stafford loans as they are consolidated and removed from the trusts 
assuming all other estimates remain the same  increasing the cpr shortens the life of the securitization trust  which  in turn  reduces the value of the residual interest 
we have also increased the discount rate used to value the embedded fixed rate floor income which results in a lower valuation of the residual interest 
we previously valued the embedded fixed rate floor income using the libor swap curve  which was consistent with the valuation methodology used in pricing and valuing floor income contracts 
we updated this estimate to be more consistent with the valuation of other cash flows that constitute the residual interest see below for further discussion 
in addition  we have responded to the recent decline in ffelp student loan default rates by lowering the projected default rates used in the valuation model 
lower projected default rates increased the value of the residual asset  partially offsetting other changes in estimates mentioned above 
the following table summarizes the significant updated estimates made in the fourth quarter that were used in the valuation of our residual interest as of december  as of december  as of september  ffelp stafford loan pre payment speed cpr in in thereafter ffelp expected credit losses as a percentage of securitized loan balance outstanding 

floor income discount rate libor swap curve libor swap curve primarily as a result of these revised assumptions regarding future activity coupled with higher than projected prepayments during  we recorded an after tax million reduction in the value of the residual interest asset  of which an after tax million was recorded as an other than temporary impairment and recognized through securitization revenue  and million was recorded as an after tax reversal of previously recorded unrealized gains in other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
these changes in assumptions will also impact future gain on sale calculations and income recognition 
embedded fixed rate floor income included in the gain on student loan securitizations of consolidation loans is an estimate of the embedded fixed rate floor income from the loans securitized 
depending on interest rate levels  the ongoing re evaluation of this estimate of embedded fixed rate floor income can cause volatility in the fair value of the retained interest asset 
the fair value of the embedded fixed rate floor income included in the retained interest asset as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
servicing and securitization revenue servicing and securitization revenue  the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as qspes  includes the interest earned on the residual interest asset  the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts  and embedded floor income on securitized student loans not previously included in the gain on sale calculation 
interest income recognized on the residual interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by periodically estimating future cash flows 
the following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended december   and  of which million  million and million  respectively  was realized in conjunction with off balance sheet transactions with qspes

we receive annual servicing fees of basis points  basis points and basis points of the outstanding securitized loan balance related to our stafford  consolidation loan and private credit student loan securitizations  respectively 
in off balance sheet securitizations which qualify as sales  we recognize a gain on the sale  which is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received 
the carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest  unamortized student loan premiums  loan loss reserves and borrower benefits reserves 
the fair value is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis over the life of the student loan portfolio using assumptions discussed in more detail below 
we recognize no gain or loss or servicing and securitization revenue associated with on balance sheet securitizations

long term beneficial interests of billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet 
repurchase obligation has been calculated based on the expiration dates of our outstanding contracts at average purchase prices of the contracts each year 
at or prior to the maturity date of the agreements  we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee  or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares 
if our stock price declines to a certain level  the third party with whom we entered into the contract could liquidate the position prior to the maturity date 
off balance sheet lending related commitments and guarantees the following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and guarantees at december  year or less to years to years over years total student loan purchases      letters of credit   lines of credit includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners discussed below estimated based on future volumes at contractually committed rates 
expiration of commitments and guarantees reflect the earlier of call date or maturity date as of december  we have forward purchase commitments to acquire student loans from various lenders including our largest lending partners  bank one and jp morgan chase 
with respect to jp morgan chase  we entered into a joint venture established solely to facilitate our acquisition of student loans originated by jp morgan chase 
under a renewable multi year agreement  we service and purchase a significant share of bank one s volume 
for further discussion of our relationships with jp morgan chase and bank one  see business student lending marketplace in part i of this annual report 
we have issued lending related financial instruments including letters of credit and lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment or if the gse fulfills its obligation under the guarantee  and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract 
most of these commitments and guarantees expire without a default occurring or without being drawn 
as a result  the total contractual amount of these instruments is not  in our view  representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements 
under the terms of the privatization act  any future activity under the line of credit and letters of credit activity by the gse is limited to guarantee commitments which were in place on august  to the extent that letters of credit and lines of credit are drawn upon  the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans 
we earn fees associated with the maintenance of these financial instruments which totaled million  million and million in   and  respectively 
at december   draws on lines of credit were approximately million  which amount is reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet 
risks overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
our most prominent risk exposures are operational  market and interest rate  political and regulatory  liquidity  credit  and consolidation loan refinancing risk 
operational risk operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors  other servicing errors see further discussion below  technology failures  breaches of the internal control system  and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the company 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
the federal guarantee on our student loans is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by the doe and guarantor agencies 
a mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small 
should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies  the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material 
our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure  and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems  any number of which could have a material impact on our business 
we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures 
these plans are tested regularly and monitored constantly 
we manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes which involve each business line as well as executive management 
the business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling  and monitoring operational risk  and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
while we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters  human error  technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud 
market and interest rate risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and or interest rates of our financial instruments 
our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads 
we have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments 
we use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure  but in our hedging activities is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed 
we measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income  the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing  the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio  particularly the impact of floor income and the rate of student loan consolidations  basis risk  credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives 
see also interest rate risk management 
we are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract 
should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels  the counter party to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price 
such settlements could result in material losses 
political regulatory risk because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program  we are subject to political and regulatory risk 
as part of the hea  the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years 
past changes included reduced loan yields paid to the lenders in and  increased fees paid by lenders in  decreased level of the government guaranty in and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors  among others 
the program is scheduled to be reauthorized in although management expects reauthorization to be completed in there can be no assurances that the reauthorization will not result in changes that may have a materially adverse impact to the company 
the secretary of education oversees and implements the hea and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business 
in addition  the activities and financial condition of the gse are regulated by the us department of the treasury s office of sallie mae oversight osmo 
liquidity risk see liquidity and capital resources securitization activities liquidity risk in connection with the wind down of the gse  we have developed multiple funding sources outside of the government agency market 
as a result  our credit spread and liquidity exposure to the capital markets shifts from the agency markets to the corporate and asset backed markets 
a major disruption in these markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds would have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans  our results of operations and the timely and effective completion of the privatization plan 
as discussed in detail above  in we substantially diversified and broadened our investor base for both our securitizations and our non gse debt 
in  we plan to continue to expand our presence in the global debt market to ensure a ready access to funding 
credit risk we bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our private credit student loan portfolio 
these loans are underwritten and priced according to risk  generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system  fico 
additionally  for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements  we require credit worthy co borrowers 
when schools close  losses may be incurred when student borrowers have not completed their education 
we have defined underwriting and collection policies  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all private credit student loans 
the performance of the private credit student loan portfolio is affected by the economy and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance 
management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private credit portfolios over the next to years depending on the portfolio 
there is  however  no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses 
see net interest income student loans activity in the allowance for student loan losses 
we have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts 
we review the credit standing of these companies 
our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in many cases  require collateral to secure the position 
the credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the company fail to perform under the terms of the contract 
we also have credit risk with several commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases 
see leveraged leases 
consolidation loan refinancing risk consolidation loans can have three detrimental effects 
first  we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders 
in and  we experienced a net runoff of million and million  respectively  of student loans from consolidation loan activity as more of our ffelp stafford student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us 
in  our increased marketing focus on consolidation loans generated a significant reduction in asset run off  a trend we expect to continue into the future 
second  consolidation loans have lower current yields than the ffelp stafford loans they replace 
this is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of consolidation loans 
third  as we wind down the gse  we must maintain sufficient  short term non gse liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized ffelp stafford loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet 
interest rate risk management interest rate gap analysis we manage our interest rate risk on a managed basis and as a result we use on and off balance sheet derivatives to hedge the basis  interest rate and foreign currency risk in our securitization trusts as the trusts typically issue asset backed securities with a variety of interest rate terms and in multiple currencies to fund student loans indexed to either the day treasury bill  commercial paper or in the case of private credit student loans  the prime rate

common stock earnings not invested in our business operations are used to pay dividends on our common stock and to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
the purpose of our common stock repurchase activity is to enhance share value more tax effectively than through dividends and to enable the remaining shareholders to own a greater percentage of outstanding shares 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million shares totaling million through equity forward settlements and open market purchases and issued million shares totaling million as a result of the exercise of stock warrants and a net million shares totaling million related to benefit plans 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million shares totaling million primarily through equity forward settlements and issued a net million shares totaling million related to benefit plans 
the net result was to decrease outstanding shares from million shares at december  to million shares at december  at december   the total common shares that could potentially be acquired over the next five years under outstanding equity forward contracts were million shares at an average price of per share 
we have remaining authority to enter into additional share repurchases and equity forward contracts for million shares 
in may  our shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares of common stock the company is authorized to issue from million shares to billion shares 
subsequently  the board of directors approved a three for one split of our common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the additional shares were distributed on june   for all shareholders of record on june  all share and per share amounts presented have been retroactively restated for the stock split 
stockholders equity has been restated to give retroactive recognition to the stock split for all periods presented by reclassifying from additional paid in capital to common stock the par value of the additional shares issued as a result of the stock split 
in july  the board of directors voted to retire million shares of common stock held in treasury  effective in september based on an average price of per share  this retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by billion  with corresponding decreases of million in common stock and billion in retained earnings 
due to the highly predictable nature of our cash flow  we utilize equity forward contracts to better manage the cost associated with our share repurchases 
in the equity forward agreements we contract to purchase shares from a third party at a future date

sfas no 
also outlines new accounting for equity forward contracts 
under sfas no 
 equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or our stock are required to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as derivative financial instruments 
those equity forward contracts that require physical settlement only cash for the purchase of shares must be accounted for as a liability 
our existing contracts provide for physical settlement  net share or net cash settlement options 
in addition  we may be required to unwind portions or all of a contract if the price of the company s common stock falls below a certain percentage of the strike price usually between percent to percent or if our credit rating falls below a pre determined level 
for equity forward contracts entered into after may   we accounted for these equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
and recorded the change in fair value through earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 equity forward contracts that we entered into prior to june  and outstanding at july   were recorded at fair value on july  and we recorded a gain of million which was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  for  we recognized a million loss related to the mark to market of our equity forward contracts 
in addition  we recorded a million loss related to net cost of carry of the equity forward contracts 
since adopting the standard in june  we settled equity forward contracts by repurchasing our common stock for million 
the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock at the market value at the time of settlement of million 
the million realized gain on these settlements that was previously recognized through equity forward mark to market was reversed in the derivative market valuation account 
gains and losses on equity forward contracts are excluded from gross income for federal and state income tax purposes 
student loan marketing association privatization act gse wind down under the privatization act  the gse must wind down its operations and dissolve on or before september   and until the gse is dissolved  the privatization act places a number of limitations on the gse 
management  however  plans to accelerate the wind down of the gse to no later than june and is well ahead of the periodic milestones 
any gse debt obligations outstanding at the date of such dissolution are required to be defeased through creation of a fully collateralized trust  consisting of cash or financial instruments backed by the full faith and credit of the us government with cash flows that match the interest and principal obligations of the defeased debt 
the privatization act requires that on the dissolution date  the gse shall repurchase or redeem  or make proper provisions for repurchase or redemption of any outstanding preferred stock 
the gse redeemed its series a  adjustable rate cumulative preferred stock  its only outstanding preferred stock  in the fourth quarter of also upon the gse s dissolution  all of its remaining assets will be transferred to the company 
the privatization act requires that the gse maintain a minimum statutory capital adequacy ratio the ratio of the gse s stockholders equity to total assets plus percent of the credit equivalent amount of certain off balance sheet items of at least percent or be subject to certain safety and soundness requirements designed to restore compliance 
while the gse may not finance or guarantee the activities of its non gse affiliates  it may  subject to its minimum capital requirements  dividend retained earnings and surplus capital to slm corporation  which in turn may contribute such amounts to its non gse subsidiaries 
at december   the gse s statutory capital adequacy ratio was percent 
the gse has also received guidance from the us department of the treasury s office of sallie mae oversight osmo regarding safety and soundness considerations affecting its wind down 
as a result  in connection with any dividend declarations  the gse will supplement the statutory minimum capital ratio requirement with a risk based capital measurement formula 
at december   the gse s capital ratio under this measurement formula was percent  which was above osmo s minimum recommended level of percent 
management does not expect the capital levels of our consolidated balance sheet to change as a result of this supplemental formula 
the privatization act imposes certain restrictions on intercompany relations between the gse and its affiliates during the wind down period 
the gse may  however  continue to issue new debt obligations maturing on or before september  although  because of the accelerated wind down described above  we are limiting the maturity on any new gse debt to six months 
the gse has not issued any long term debt since july the legislation further provides that the legal status and attributes of the gse s debt obligations  including the exemptions from securities and exchange commission registration and state taxes  will be fully preserved until their respective maturities 
such debt obligations will remain gse debt obligations  whether such obligations were outstanding at the time of  or issued subsequent to  the reorganization of the gse into the current holding company structure 
in connection with the wind down of the gse  we must either securitize  sell  transfer or defease the gse s assets by the wind down date and retire or defease the gse s debt obligations 
for loans securitized  the gse retains an interest in the loans  which is recognized on the balance sheet as retained interest in securitized receivables 
in connection with the gse wind down  the gse sold its retained interests to a non gse subsidiary of the company for billion 
the gse will continue to finance student loans through securitizations in  and intends to sell its retained interest in such securitizations as soon as practical after the sale 
during the course of developing the wind down plan  management was advised by its tax counsel that  while the matter is not certain  under current authority  the defeasance of certain gse bonds that mature after the dissolution of the gse  could be construed to be a taxable event for taxable holders of those bonds 
management intends to commence discussions on this matter with the internal revenue service and may seek a private letter ruling that the defeasance does not trigger a taxable event for such bondholders in the context of the gse s privatization 
given the gse s current exemption from state income taxes  management is continually evaluating the potential impact if any upon the company s overall state tax position resulting from planned sales and transfers of gse assets

the error has caused approximately million of the company s serviced student loan accounts to amortize too quickly or slowly  ie  not in accordance with their repayment term 
the company took voluntary remedial action by crediting the affected borrowers accounts and took a million charge for servicing adjustments in the first quarter of for the estimated interest credit 
payment amounts have been reset to the correctly amortizing amount and affected borrowers have been notified 
the company reported this matter to the doe and met with its representatives on several occasions to discuss the impact of the under billing error on borrowers and the company s remedial actions 
based upon these discussions and an agreement with the doe  the company will provide adjustments and additional future credits to the affected borrowers 
the company does not expect these future credits to materially effect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
congress reauthorizes the higher education act every five years 
the higher education act was originally scheduled to expire on september   but by its terms was automatically extended to september  we now expect that congress will actively debate provisions of the higher education act that govern the ffelp and the fdlp during and final action on the next reauthorization may not occur until following another short extension of the current act 
as with past higher education act reauthorizations  there are many legislative proposals being advanced by schools  industry participants and other interested stakeholders 
sallie mae has joined the coalition for better student loans  a group of organizations representing colleges  universities  financial aid administrators  parents and other loan providers that has advanced a series of proposals designed to strengthen federal student loan programs  including lowering the cost of borrowing by eliminating origination fees paid by needy students  raising stafford loan limits to permit schools to offer students more federal student loans with their below market interest rates and student friendly repayment terms  making it easier for students to repay their loans by offering more flexible repayment options  maintaining a viable loan consolidation program  and extending loan forgiveness to borrowers who work in certain highly needed occupations 
the president s budget also contains proposals to increase first year loan limits  expand extended repayment options for ffelp borrowers  mandate a one percent guaranty fee for borrowers  and phase out higher special allowance payments associated with certain tax exempt student loan bonds 
other proposals have already been introduced by members of congress  including proposals to provide financial incentives to schools to join the fdlp  repeal the single holder rule  permit borrowers who already completed their higher education studies to refinance or reconsolidate previously consolidated loans and eliminate floor income on variable rate student loans 
under the single holder rule  if only one lender holds all of a borrower s loans  then another lender cannot consolidate the loan away from the current holder unless the current holder declines to consolidate loans for the borrower or is unwilling to offer income sensitive repayment terms 
if the single holder rule is repealed  the company s student loan portfolio could be subject to an increased level of consolidation activity 
in addition  if the reconsolidation proposal is enacted  the company could experience a significant increase in refinancing activity  which  in turn  would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
finally  enactment of the proposal to eliminate floor income would decrease the company s interest income in certain interest rate environments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis the effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management 
the following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended december  and and the effect on fair values at december  and  based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remain constant 
we have chosen to show the effects of a hypothetical increase to interest rates  as an increase gives rise to a larger absolute value change to the financial statements 
the effect on earnings was performed on our variable rate assets  liabilities and hedging instruments while the effect on fair values was performed on our fixed rate assets  liabilities and hedging instruments 
year ended december  year ended december  interest rates interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions  except per share amounts effect on earnings increase decrease in pre tax net income before derivative market value adjustment unrealized mark to market derivative market value adjustment change in fair value unrealized increase in net income before taxes increase in diluted earnings per share 


our foreign currency denominated debt outstanding is swapped to us dollar 
any change in foreign currency exchange rates would have no impact on net income 
our equity forward contracts are carried at fair value 
every dollar change in the company s stock price results in a million gain or loss 
at december  interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions fair value effect on fair values assets student loans  other earning assets  other assets  total assets    liabilities interest bearing liabilities    other liabilities   total liabilities   at december  interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions fair value effect on fair values assets student loans   other earning assets  other assets  total assets   liabilities interest bearing liabilities  other liabilities   total liabilities   a primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt 
however  as discussed under student loans floor income  in the current low interest rate environment  we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding as the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating 
therefore  absent other hedges  in a low interest rate environment the hypothetical rise in interest rates in the above table has a greater adverse effect on earnings and fair values due to the reduction in potential floor income than in higher interest rate environments where the interest rate formula rises above the borrower rate and the student loans become a floating rate asset that is matched with floating rate debt 
during the year ended december   certain ffelp student loans were earning floor income and we locked in a portion of that floor income through the use of futures and floor income contracts 
the result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of floating rate debt into fixed rate debt  matching the fixed rate nature of the student loans and fixing the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the converted fixed rate liability 
in the above table under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points  the decrease in pre tax net income before sfas no 
reflects lower floor income on the unhedged portion of our student loan portfolio 
under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points  the change in pre tax net income before sfas no 
is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a basis point increase in rates
