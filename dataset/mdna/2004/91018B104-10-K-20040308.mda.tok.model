item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview united defense is a leader in the design  development and production of combat vehicles  artillery systems  naval guns  missile launchers and precision munitions used by the us department of defense dod and more than foreign militaries  and is the leading us provider of non nuclear ship repair  modernization and conversion services to the us navy and related government agencies 
for many of our key dod programs  we are either the sole source prime contractor and systems integrator or have been selected as the subcontractor to provide a major element or system in the overall program 
we conduct global operations through our manufacturing facilities in the united states and sweden  our ship repair facilities in key homeport locations for the us navy  a manufacturing joint venture in turkey  and co production programs with various other governments and foreign contractors 

table of contents the carlyle group carlyle formed united defense industries  inc in october to facilitate the acquisition of united defense  lp  our predecessor entity 
as of february   carlyle had sold major portions of their original investment in our company  and presently owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in july we acquired usmr from carlyle 
we had a firm funded backlog of approximately billion as of december   a substantial majority of which was derived from sole source  prime contracts 
approximately of our sales for the year ended december  were to the us government  primarily to agencies of the dod excluding foreign military sales  or through subcontracts with other government contractors 
our results of operations  particularly revenue  gross profits and cash flows  vary significantly from period to period  depending largely upon the timing of our delivery of finished products  the terms of our contracts and our level of export sales 
as a result  period to period comparisons may show substantial changes disproportionate to our underlying business activity 
period to period comparisons are also affected by acquisitions where the results of operations for the acquired business are included in our results only for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
our contracts typically fall into two categories  cost plus and fixed price 
our contracts for research  engineering  prototypes  and some other matters are typically cost plus arrangements  under which we are reimbursed for approved costs and also receive a fee 
our production contracts are typically fixed price arrangements under which we assume the risk of cost overruns and receive the benefit of cost savings 
our repair and maintenance contracts are a mix of fixed price and cost plus arrangements with a recent trend toward cost plus 
all of our dod contracts  whether we are the prime contractor or a subcontractor  are subject to audit and cost controls 
as a result  the dod has the right to object to our costs as not allowable or as unreasonable  which can preclude recovery of these costs on both cost plus and negotiated fixed price contracts 
emerging trends and uncertainties fundamentally  our business results are governed by the degree to which pertinent defense programs are funded by the us government and  for export and foreign sales  by foreign governments  the priorities and acquisition strategies chosen by the department of defense and its foreign counterparts  and our success in obtaining contracts and performing them to the satisfaction of our customers 
additionally  as described below  other factors distinctive to united defense and its financial structure and situation also tend to influence our financial performance 
the current geopolitical climate and its interpretation by the us government has affected  and will likely to continue to affect  our overall business performance in sometimes conflicting ways 
in general  the concern for us military security was dramatically increased by the september  attack  and the consequent heightened attention was focused in particular ways by the ensuing us military operations in afghanistan and iraq 
the primary initial impact of these events was to generate a significant political consensus for increased defense spending  which in turn raised the dod budget in all three areas of principal interest to us procurement  research and development r d  and operations and maintenance o m 
we tend to benefit from increased procurement appropriations because they provide the principal source of funding for production of our established systems such as the bradley  naval guns  and naval missile launchers 
r d spending by contrast tends to support the development of new weapon systems in which we frequently have a lead role  such as vehicles for the army s fcs program  new artillery systems such as the crusader  prior to its cancellation  and subsequently its nlos c replacement  and new naval weapons such as the ags 
o m spending frequently translates into increased revenues for us in such areas as replacement track shoes for land combat vehicles  and more frequent ship repair and maintenance work 
references below to fy and the like refer to the us government s october september fiscal years  which are the periods for which federal funds are appropriated and spent 
however  the nation s recent military challenges have brought with them a potentially far reaching reexamination of the structure  organization  and equipment appropriate to future warfighting  particularly as it affects the us army  which for decades was our largest single customer 
additionally  the greatly expanded scale of dod operations in the middle east has tended to elevate the importance of funding current 
table of contents operations  which with their in the field urgency tend to enjoy a priority over longer term dod objectives in procurement and r d 
thus the general political receptiveness to higher defense spending does not necessarily translate into uniformly improved financial performance for us  particularly given that the production of existing systems has historically produced our highest profit margins 
in and  the aggregate effect of the foregoing factors was to significantly improve the results of our ship repair and maintenance segment  missile canister business  and replacement track business for combat vehicles 
at the same time  as discussed in greater detail below  dod s strategic reexamination of the us military force structure  conducted under the general heading of transformation  tended to reduce procurement spending on what have been our mainstay combat vehicle programs while increasing r d spending on the proposed next generation of combat weapons  particularly the fcs program and the navy s new surface ship programs  the dd x and littoral combat ship 
we expect these influences to continue in and beyond 
in terms of the overall us government budget  we are uncertain as to how the larger national competing priorities will impact our overall business environment 
dod competes for federal funding with all of the government s nondefense agencies  and dod s overall budgetary allocation could accordingly be capped or driven downward in fy and beyond by such factors as the rising federal deficit  a perception that the us has been victorious in iraq and may now safely revert to a pattern of peacetime spending priorities  and the competing claims of such nondefense areas as health care and education 
conversely  defense spending would likely be pushed up by new terrorist attacks  increased geopolitical tensions regarding north korea or taiwan  or new difficulties in the middle east 
we claim no special insight as to how such competing priorities will ultimately be resolved  but we do believe that with nearly of our revenues and profits deriving from defense programs  our aggregate results and financial condition will continue to be significantly affected by the overall allocation of government spending toward or away from defense 
land combat vehicles historically  the largest portion of our revenues and profits derived from the development and production of land combat vehicles 
in  our revenues from such programs totaled million  or of our total revenue 
of such totals  approximately came from us army programs 
since the army has been developing and implementing a long term transformational plan 
while the pace and specific elements of the army s plan have been the subject of ongoing adjustments  which we believe are likely to continue  the overall approach has involved three principal areas of focus maintenance of the so called current force  consisting largely of tracked  armored combat vehicles such as the bradley  the hercules recovery vehicle  and the paladin artillery systems produced and upgraded by our company  rapid fielding of a lighter weight  wheeled family of combat vehicles the stryker  formerly known as the interim armored vehicle  or iav  as an interim step toward the more rapidly deployable future force  and development of a long term future fighting force of digitally linked air and land reconnaissance and combat elements known as the fcs program 
we do not participate significantly in the stryker program  but we have major positions in both the current force and fcs 
because fcs is conceptually ambitious  requires significant technological advances  and is envisioned ultimately to encompass major portions of the army s major combat equipment  the army has proposed long term fcs expenditures on a record scale 
the administration proposes to spend billion on fcs from fy through fy  including billion in fy alone  or approximately of total research and development spending during those years 
the army selected united defense for a principal role in the development of fcs manned ground vehicles fcs mgvs  and we accordingly entered into implementing agreements with general dynamics land systems  the army s designated co developer for fcs mgvs  and the boeing company  which the army selected in as the lead system integrator for the fcs program as a whole 
in december we received our largest development contract ever  in the form of a billion subcontract award from boeing for system design and development work on fcs mgvs 
our work  which is to be performed over the period  will consist primarily of the development of certain major common elements to be used on all fcs mgvs  consisting of crew stations  propulsion  armor  active protection  signature management  defensive armament  and software architecture  and five of the eight 
table of contents types of fcs mgvs  consisting of the nlos m  icv  mv  mrv  and the nlos c artillery vehicle 
the army has established cy as its intended commencement date for fielding fcs combat units  which would imply that volume production of fcs mgvs may not begin until in the fy and fy legislative cycles  congress imposed a requirement that the nlos c be fielded by  which would require commensurately earlier production 
discussions regarding overall fcs program management  budgetary control  and schedule are ongoing between congress and the army  the outcome of which is yet unknown 
the army has also indicated that  particularly in view of the intense pace of combat operations in iraq and the need to maintain the current force until perhaps  the current force vehicles will require further rebuild and modernization efforts 
in fy  congress appropriated million for continued bradley modernization  which will provide us with production work into given the various factors described above  we cannot yet foresee with precision what mix of combat vehicle business may be under contract beyond  and of course export orders which we are also pursuing may have a significant bearing on this aspect of our business  but we recognize the potential risk of a production gap in our combat vehicle facilities if our current force work should wind down or terminate before fcs production work were to commence 
a prolonged suspension of production could reduce our workforce and employee skill base and necessitate the contraction of our manufacturing facilities 
naval weapon systems for several decades  the mainstays of our naval weapon systems business have been the development and production of guns and missile launching systems for surface warships 
our principal product lines for at least the last ten years have been the us navy s inch  mk gun system and the mk vertical launch system vls  either or both of which have been installed on virtually all of the cruisers and destroyers built by the navy during that period 
we have also sold mk and vls products to certain foreign navies  and our naval sales have also included vls canisters used for each missile launch from the vls  submarine propulsors  and rebuild and overhaul work on other weapon systems for surface ships 
we participate in the mk program as a prime contractor  and in the vls program as a subcontractor to lockheed martin company 
in our naval weapon system sales which include r d  production  and rebuild work totaled million  or of our total revenue 
as with the other military services  the navy is engaged in substantial planning and development efforts for its future force 
one of the navy s largest ship development programs is known as dd x  which is envisioned as the construction of at least new surface warships to replace many of the navy s existing destroyers 
we participate in the dd x program as the provider of the two major weapon systems for the vessels the ags gun  and the next generation vls  known as the mk the navy awarded the dd x design contract to northrop grumman corporation ngc  and we are ngc s subcontractor responsible for the design and development of the ags and act as a subcontractor for the mk to raytheon company  who is in turn the system subcontractor to ngc 
the scale and complexity of the dd x program  combined with ongoing political oversight from the administration and congress  result in uncertainty regarding the ultimate development schedule  production scale  and spending level for dd x 
however  current navy budgetary estimates allow approximately million for the systems we would provide on the lead ship  a figure which would presumably decline on a per ship basis if dd x reaches regular production  but which would nonetheless provide at least twice the per ship revenue we receive on current navy destroyers 
our existing ags and mk subcontracts would provide approximately million in revenue for development work to be completed by we expect to continue to build mk guns and mk vls subsystems for the navy s currently produced ddg class of destroyers  six more of which are projected for completion by we also expect to continue to build vls canisters  submarine propulsors  and other current naval systems for approximately the next years  if not longer 
also  the navy has expressed significant interest in using our bofors mm gun on the lcs  a class of smaller surface ships which may involve the construction of or more vessels  and the us coast guard has selected the mm gun for its new class of national security cutters in its new deepwater program 
all such programs  together with the substantial emerging development work on the 
table of contents ags and the mk vls  indicate that our naval weapon system business will continue to increase  both in terms of absolute revenue and profit volume  and as a proportion of our defense systems segment 
ship repair and maintenance in recent years  an important element of the success of our ship repair and maintenance segment has been our practice of locating its principal facilities at the same locations where the us navy home ports major portions of its fleet 
this proximity accommodates the navy s preference to have ship repair work performed at locations where most or all of the ship s crew reside 
additionally  we have benefited both from the navy s practice of extending the service lives of major vessels  which tend to require more extensive work as they age  and from the intensified pace of naval operations for the us military campaigns in afghanistan and iraq 
to the extent that the navy s operations decline in the wake of the regime changes in those countries  our ship repair business may decline 
in the overall allocation of dod budgetary resources referred to earlier  the navy must in turn determine how to apportion its funding between building new vessels and upgrading and repairing older ones 
the navy has decided to retire some of its older ships ahead of schedule in order to free up funds for new construction  and the tradeoff between these competing priorities is generally subject to attentive political oversight 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate apportionment of funding between new and existing ships  we are aware that a pronounced shift to new construction could result in the further retirement of older naval vessels and a corresponding decline in overall repair requirements 
we do not expect such developments to significantly affect the results of our ship repair and maintenance segment during  but their possible impact in and beyond is unclear 
turkish joint venture as we do not consolidate the results of our turkish joint venture entity  fnss  its contribution to our financial results are primarily through payments of royalties and dividends 
since fnss commenced production in the early s  with the exception of two or three years it has been major a contributor to our profits  and expected to be so again in however  fnss has always been heavily dependent on armored combat vehicle production work for the turkish armed forces  and its current contract  which commenced in and involves the production of vehicles  is scheduled to be completed by the end of  as is another fnss contract involving the production of armored combat vehicles for the government of malaysia 
fnss is currently pursuing further production contracts for turkey  malaysia  and elsewhere  without which its operations might be substantially curtailed in or just as in the united states  the award of military contracts in these countries is substantially dependent on the larger political process by which national budgets are allocated between civilian and military agencies  and within the military sphere among various competing program priorities 
additionally  even if one or more of these countries allocates budgetary funds for combat vehicle programs  fnss may face competition from other combat vehicle suppliers 
accordingly  we are currently unable to access the outcome of fnss ongoing business development efforts 
given the historical contribution of fnss to our financial results  however  we expect our results to continue to be affected by its ongoing business fortunes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
in particular  estimates are used for contract costs and revenues in the earnings recognition process  accruals related to environmental and other liabilities  and pension and other retirement costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue and cost recognition 
we recognize sales on fixed price production contracts when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for our dod production contracts  those criteria are typically met when the manufacture of the product is completed and the customer has certified it as meeting the contract specifications and as having passed quality control tests 
however  under recent bradley and m production contracts  sales are not recognized until the vehicles are fielded to individual us army units because it is at that point that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
fielding a vehicle refers 
table of contents to the final deprocessing activity such as checking for proper running condition  installing on board equipment  and getting the certified customer acceptance at their site of operation 
this contractual provision extends the period of time during which these vehicles are carried as inventory and may result in an uneven distribution of revenue from these contracts between periods 
for our foreign production contracts  sales are generally recorded upon shipment of products to the customer  which corresponds to when the risks and rewards of ownership transfer 
we tend to deliver products to our foreign customers in lots  which also results in an inventory build up pending delivery 
under fixed price ship repair and maintenance contracts  contract costs are expensed as incurred and sales are recognized simultaneously based on the ratio of direct labor inputs and other costs incurred to date compared with estimated total direct labor inputs and total costs 
sales under cost plus contracts for research  engineering  prototypes  ship repair and maintenance and certain other contracts are recorded as costs are incurred and include estimated fees in the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs 
we use the long term contract method of accounting for our fixed price contracts and therefore record gross margin on each unit produced at the time a sale is recognized  based on an estimate of the margin that will be realized over the life of the related contract 
we currently evaluate estimates of gross margin periodically during the year and use the cumulative catch up method to recognize changes in estimates of sales and gross margins during the period in which those changes are determined 
we charge any anticipated losses on a contract to operations as soon as those losses are determined 
the principal components of cost of sales for our production and ship repair and maintenance contracts are materials  subcontractor costs  labor and overhead 
the principal components of cost of sales for engineering and development contracts are compensation costs for the engineers and designers and related overhead necessary to support those personnel 
all of these costs are charged to inventory as incurred except for ship repair and maintenance costs  which are expensed as incurred 
we use the last in  first out  or lifo  method of accounting for the majority of our inventory  which generally results in higher cost of sales in periods when current costs of the inventory are higher than comparable costs in prior periods and a periodic charge to earnings to reflect changes in the costs of components of inventory 
we expense selling  general  administrative  and research and development costs in the period incurred 
the major components of these costs include compensation  overhead and amortization of intangibles 
investments in affiliated companies 
our investment in our owned foreign joint venture in turkey  fnss  is accounted for by using the equity method because we do not control the joint venture due to our partner s veto rights over major operating decisions 
this same accounting treatment was used for our joint venture in saudi arabia  uds  prior to the sale of our interest in the company 
accrued environmental liabilities 
we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to  along with other factors  difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  and agreements between potentially responsible parties to share in the cost of remediation 
given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur as described above  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
pension and other retirement costs 
most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with income or expense for qualified defined benefit plans pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
we use actuarial valuations to compute the income or expense for the plans 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year 
table of contents end assumptions used to estimate pension income or expense for the following fiscal year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
we use judgment in selecting these assumptions each year because we have to consider not only current market conditions  but also make judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants

revenue for was  million  an increase of million or from  million for this increase is attributable primarily to the inclusion of revenues from usmr for a full twelve months versus only six months in as the acquisition of usmr was completed on july  ship repair and maintenance sales of million compare with million in in 
table of contents usmr sales were higher than annualized levels due to primarily to approximately million in new work from a us navy contract in mayport  florida for the overhaul of machinery spaces on the carrier uss john f 
kennedy 
we anticipate a sustained high level of maintenance and repair through the first half of and a more normal level of activity for the balance of the year 
defense systems segment sales of  million were or million higher than the  million in with higher aav deliveries to italy and korea  a step up in activity for the advanced gun system  and higher bofors sales more than offsetting lower bradley and m tank recovery vehicle sales 
bradley sales were impacted by the army s inability to adhere to the contractual fielding schedule because of war related priorities 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year as a result of increased sales  higher award fees and contract adjustments associated with productivity improvements 
gross profit as a percent of sales was  up percentage point from despite having a full year of lower margin ship repair business 
the defense systems segment s gross profit as a percent of sales was for compared with for the year major factors in the higher profit margin for the defense systems segment were the receipt of an million award fee for the crusader program for work that had essentially been performed in previous years  and contract adjustments for various production programs due to efficiencies realized through productivity improvements 
the ship repair and maintenance segment s gross profit rate for was compared with in this segment s lower margin in is a result of a change in mix of business and the timing of award fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  a million increase from million for the increase was due almost entirely to the inclusion of a full year of usmr versus just six months in research and development 
research and development costs were million for  an increase of million from the prior year due to higher spending associated with a risk mitigation project 
earnings from foreign affiliates 
earnings from foreign affiliates for were million  a million increase from the prior year 
this increase was due to increased earnings from the joint venture in turkey reflecting an increase in deliveries which more than offset the fact that from march onward  we no longer received a share of earnings from our former joint venture in saudi arabia 
net interest expense 
net interest expense for was million  a million decrease from the prior year 
this decrease was the result of lower average outstanding balances and lower amortization of financing costs in provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was due to higher taxable income and the reversal of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which substantially offset income tax expense in year ended december  compared to year ended december  during we had only one reportable segment 
revenue 
revenue for was  million  an increase of million or from  million for this increase was attributable to the inclusion of million of usmr results in our ship repair and maintenance segment in which did not exist in  and million in higher defense systems segment sales in including a million increase in bradley vehicles and a million increase in m tank recovery vehicles 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year as a result of increased sales 
the defense systems segment s gross profit was for compared with for the year the ship repair and maintenance segment gross profit rate for the year was 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  a million  or decrease from million for the decrease was due to lower amortization costs of intangibles and no amortization of goodwill due to the non amortization provision of fas  and the absence of significant non recurring charges resulting from the initial public offering and recapitalization that were incurred in these decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of million of usmr selling  general and administration costs for the last six months of 
table of contents research and development 
research and development costs were million for  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase resulted from significant spending to develop and build a wheeled vehicle prototype which could be a model for the wheeled vehicle platform for the future combat systems program 
earnings from foreign affiliates 
earnings from foreign affiliates in the defense systems segment for were million  net of amounts paid to our turkish partner  a million increase from the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to increased earnings from the joint venture in turkey as production continues to ramp up to meet contract schedules  which more than offset the fact that we stopped recording our share of earnings from our joint venture in saudi arabia in march pursuant to an agreement to divest the saudi venture 
net interest expense 
net interest expense for was million  a million decrease from the prior year 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase was due to higher taxable income  net of the impact of the reversal of the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations 
we have generated annual positive cash flow from operating activities since the formation of united defense industries  inc in october our liquidity requirements depend on a number of factors  including the timing of production under us government and foreign sales contracts 
payments on these contracts are typically received based on performance milestones or when a specified percentage of contract expenses are incurred 
these advance payments help reduce the need to finance working capital 
however  working capital needs fluctuate between periods as a result of changes in program status and the timing of payments by program 
for example  under the recent production contract related to the bradley program  the final payment increment  which is about of the total price for each vehicle is not received until the us army fields the vehicle  which may be significantly later than the time at which we finish vehicle production 
cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior period 
the primary reasons for this increase were higher net income  tax payments less than the tax provision as we continued to enjoy a net operating loss of million in  and receipt of higher earnings distributions  net of taxes  from our joint venture in turkey 
cash provided by operating activities for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior period 
increased net income primarily drove the improved level of cash provided during the period 
higher cash provided by operating activities was also due to increased milestone payments from the us government mainly for bradley and vls programs and advance payments from foreign customers 
this favorable cash variance was partially offset by growth in trade receivables  due primarily to the timing of bradley deliveries and associated payments from the us government 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared with in the prior year period 
capital expenditures of million in were million higher than in due primarily to the purchase and installation of a drydock in norfolk  va 
expenditures for manufacturing  ship repair  and computer equipment and software primarily represent the balance of capital spending and include a full year of usmr normal capital expenditures versus six months in cash used for investing activities in included the acquisition of usmr for million net of million cash acquired and cell its ab for million 
cash used in investing activities was million in  compared with million of cash used in investing activities in the increase in cash used in was mainly due to the purchase of usmr and cell its for million and million  respectively 
generally our capital expenditures are for replacement of manufacturing and computer equipment and software 

table of contents on february   we completed the acquisition of kaiser compositek  inc and on march  we completed the acquisition of honolulu shipyard  inc and cercom  inc 
an aggregate of approximately million of our cash is expected to be spent during the first quarter of for such acquisitions 
with regard to financing activities  on july   we amended our credit facility to borrow an additional million for the purchase of usmr and subsequently repaid million 
in  cash provided was primarily the result of the august refinancing of indebtedness of million and of proceeds from the sale of common stock of million 
these funds were used to make repayments of debt of million  dividend distributions of million  and to pay for refinancing costs and common stock issuance costs totaling million  resulting in a net use of cash of million in on august   we refinanced all of our existing indebtedness 
in connection with the refinancing  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility  consisting of million in term loans and a million revolving credit facility 
on july  we amended the credit facility to borrow an additional million for the purchase of usmr 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the interest rate on the million term a borrowings and on the million term b borrowings was 
loans made pursuant to the term a and term b loan facilities require equal quarterly amortization payments 
the payment schedule as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period less than long term debt total year years years term a term b total based on the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that cash from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  including borrowings available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and required payments of principal and interest on debt through at least december  the growth and acquisition strategy  however  may require substantial additional capital 
other factors from through  we had sufficient income tax losses to offset nearly all federal and state income taxes which would otherwise have applied to our operations 
however  our carry forward of such losses was exhausted in  with the result that our income tax provision increased from million in to million in to million in barring unforeseen developments  for and beyond we expect to pay income taxes at essentially the full corporate rate  net of credits  of approximately  and to such extent our net income would be reduced in comparison to years prior to 
as of december  we held cash and equivalents totaling approximately million 
given that growth through further defense sector acquisitions has been an important element of our overall business strategy  we have been accumulating cash partly for such use 
given our recently completed acquisition transactions involving kaiser compositek  inc  honolulu shipyard  inc and cercom  inc  an aggregate of approximately million of our cash is expected to be spent for such purposes during the first quarter of if we do not use significant portions of the remaining cash balance for further acquisitions  such funds may instead be used for such purposes of debt prepayment and or the repurchase of common stock 
depending on the nature and extent of our choices in such respects  our financial performance and or the returns received by our stockholders may differ from those in prior years 
given the current dynamic conditions in our industry and the range of significant variables which we would expect to bear on such choices  we cannot yet ascertain the impact of such matters in or beyond 
effective december   we lowered the discount rate we use for actuarially determining pension and other retirement benefit costs from to 
consequently  the estimated expense for retirement benefits is expected to increase by about million in from the million that was incurred in 
table of contents the actual number could differ from this estimate dependent on staffing levels  asset performance and other factors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future payments due  aggregated by type of contractual obligation  at december  payments due by period and total thereafter in millions long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations a total a although we have significant other purchase obligations  most commonly in the form of purchase orders  the timing of the purchase is often variable rather than specific and the payments due are substantially reimbursed by the customer through overhead rates  progress payments  milestone payments  and cost reimbursable contract terms at substantially the same time as payment is made 
accordingly  these obligations are not included in the table above 
commercial commitments commercial commitments are funding commitments that could potentially require us to perform in the event of demands by third parties or if other contingent events occur 
we have a committed credit facility in place providing  in part  for a million revolving line of credit  further providing for loans and letters of credit 
as of december   million was available under this revolving line of credit and we had standby letters of credit of million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
forward currency exchange risk we conduct some of our operations outside the us in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
to mitigate the risk associated with fluctuating currencies on short term and long term foreign currency denominated transactions  we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we do not enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes 
interest rate risk borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of december  the weighted average interest rate on the million term a borrowings and on the million term b borrowings was 
loans made pursuant to the term a loan facility require equal quarterly amortization payments of million beginning on march   with a final payment due on august  loans made pursuant to the term b facility require quarterly amortization payments of million beginning on march  until june   and million each quarter thereafter with a final payment due on august  the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings outstanding under the senior secured credit facility as of december  was per annum 
in january  we entered into an interest rate protection agreement to mitigate risks associated with variable interest rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
the specified contract amount of this interest rate swap agreement is million 
the agreement entitles us to pay a base interest rate of  in 
table of contents return for the right to receive a floating interest rate which is based on three month libor as of each quarterly measurement date 
in the event the three month libor at the measurement date exceeds  the base interest rate is adjusted to the then effective libor up to a maximum of 
usmr had also entered into an interest rate protection agreement to mitigate risks associated with variable interest rate borrowings 
the specified amount of the agreement is million which matured on january  the agreement entitled us to pay a base interest rate of in return for the right to receive a floating interest rate that was based on three month libor as of each quarterly measurement date 
the net cash amounts paid or received on these agreements are accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
