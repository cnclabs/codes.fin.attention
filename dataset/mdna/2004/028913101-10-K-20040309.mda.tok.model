item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the senior living industry is experiencing growth as a result of demographic and various other factors 
according to census data  the over age population in the united states is growing much faster than the general population 
the company has seen increasing demand for services at both its retirement centers and free standing als during the past year  and expects that this demand will continue over the next several years 
as a general rule  economic factors that affect seniors will have a corresponding impact on the senior living industry 
for example  general concerns regarding lower interest rates on savings and uncertainty of investment returns have impacted seniors during the past several years  as well as uncertainties related to world events such as the iraqi war 
on the other hand  the continuing strength of the home resale market in most areas of the country has been beneficial to seniors  since the equity from the sale of a home is a significant source of funding for senior living care in many cases 
in addition  overall economic conditions and general consumer confidence can impact the industry  since many adult children subsidize the cost for care of elderly parents  and share in decisions regarding their care 
the assisted living industry is maturing and rapidly evolving 
the demand for assisted living services increased significantly beginning with the emergence of the industry segment in the mid s 
however  the development of new assisted living communities across the country outstripped demand during this period  resulting in oversupply of unit capacity  longer fill up times  price pressures and deep discounting 
while this trend continues  the demand for assisted living services  coupled with minimal new development activity  reduced to some extent the oversupply in many of the company s markets in and as a result  the company was able to increase occupancy and increase rates and reduce promotional discounting for its free standing als during the company believes that new assisted living development will remain at sustainable levels and accordingly  this trend will continue 
the average length of stay in the free standing al segment is approximately two years  which represents a challenge and an opportunity for the company 
the company must find a number of new residents to maintain and build occupancy 
however  it also has the opportunity to mark to market if it is able to attract new residents at higher current market rates  replacing those prior residents that had lower or discounted rates 
the retirement center segment is a more mature segment of the industry  and has seen demand and price increases in recent years  with new unit capacity entering the market at sustainable levels 
management expects this growth in demand and selling rate increases to continue over the next several years 
the average length of stay is much longer in the retirement centers  approximately five years in the rental communities  and approximately years in the ef communities 
in addition  the company believes that many of its retirement centers benefit from significant barriers to entry from competitors  including the significant cost and length of time to develop competitive communities  the difficulty in finding acceptable development sites in the geographical areas in which the company s retirement centers are located  and the length of time and difficulty in developing strong competing reputations 
the company earns its revenues primarily by providing housing and services to its residents 
approximately of its revenues come from private pay sources  meaning that residents or their families pay from their own funds or from the proceeds of their long term care policies 
all private pay residents are billed in advance for the next month s housing and care 
in addition  the company receives revenues from the sale of entrance fee contracts at the company s ef communities 
while this cash is received at the time the resident moves in  the non refundable portion of the entrance fee is primarily recognized as income for financial reporting purposes over the actuarial life of the resident 
the company s most significant expenses are community operating expenses labor and labor related expenses for community associates are approximately of this line item 
other significant items in this category are food costs  property taxes  utility costs  marketing costs and insurance 
the company increased its marketing expenditures in recent years in response to overcapacity in the assisted living industry  and in response to general economic conditions during and early general and administrative labor costs are also the largest component for this category  comprising the home office and regional staff supporting the communities 
other significant items are liability insurance and related costs  travel  and legal and professional services 
in response to higher liability insurance costs and deductibles in recent years  and the inherent liability risk in providing personal and health related services to seniors  the company has significantly increased its staff and resources involved in quality assurance  compliance and risk management 
lease expense the company s lease expense has grown significantly over the past two years  as a result of the large number of sale leaseback transactions completed in connection with the refinancing plan  as well as various transactions 
the company s lease expense includes the rent expense for all operating leases  plus an accrual for lease escalators in future years the impact of these future escalators is spread evenly over the lease term for financial reporting purposes 
depreciation and amortization expense the company incurs significant depreciation expense on its fixed assets primarily community buildings and equipment and amortization expense related primarily to leasehold acquisition costs 
interest expense the company s interest expense is comprised of interest on its outstanding debt and capital leases 
the interest expense includes both the current cash portion and the accrued but deferred portion of the interest under the mezzanine loan 
results of operations the company s results of operations in recent years should be considered in light of the following factors  some of which are likely to influence the company s future operating results and financial outlook prior to the late s  the company exclusively owned and operated retirement centers 
the company s expansion into the assisted living market during the late s with most of its free standing als opening during and resulted in large amounts of new debt and lease financing 
while the assisted living market grew rapidly during this period  an oversupply of new units caused slower than anticipated fill up times for these communities  at lower than anticipated prices 
consequently  many of the free standing als incurred large start up losses beginning in  and have taken longer than anticipated to reach stabilized occupancy levels 
seventeen of the free standing als have not yet reached stabilized occupancy 
as a result  the company s free standing al portfolio consumed the majority of the company s available cash over the past several years 
the company had over million of current debt maturities during  which was largely associated with the development and financing of the free standing als  which were maturing at a time when the free standing als were still filling up and producing weak operating results 
in addition  the assisted living industry in general  was in a weakened financial condition and many providers were insolvent 
as a result  the company had diminished access to mortgage refinancings and other capital sources during this period 
the company completed the refinancing plan which included mortgage refinancings  a series of sale leaseback transactions predominately on assisted living properties still in fill up stage  an exchange offer for its maturing convertible debentures and the mezzanine loan 
many of these financing transactions resulted in large gains or losses to the company 
while the losses immediately reduced the company s reported equity  approximately million of gains on various sale leaseback transactions have been deferred and will be recognized over the terms of the subject leases 
although the company satisfied its current debt maturities through the refinancing plan  the company remains highly leveraged with substantial debt and lease obligations 
the company incurred additional debt and lease obligations and most of them at increased interest rates  including the interest rate paid currently on the mezzanine loan 
the completion of the refinancing plan  however  allowed the company to focus on improving operating results and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise to reduce its cost of capital and its leverage 
the retirement centers are the company s largest segment and provide most of the community operating contribution 
this segment has experienced significant increases in revenue and community operating contribution during the past three years  which the company expects to continue 
while the free standing al segment produced a positive community operating contribution for  and greatly increased operating contribution for the company expects this trend to continue so long as market conditions remain stable 
segment results the company operates in three business segments retirement centers  free standing als  and management services 
the following table presents the number  total unit capacity and total ending and average occupancy percentages of the company s communities by operating segment at december   and number of communities ending occupancy average occupancy total ending ending occupied average occupied capacity units units december  december  year ended december  retirement centers free standing als management services total the company measures the performance of its three business segments  in part  based upon the operating contribution produced by these business segments 
the company computes operating contribution by deducting the operating expenses associated with a segment from the revenues produced by that segment

freestanding al revenues represent the company s consolidated revenues for the period throughout the year the communities were owned or leased 
the company acquired leasehold interests of free standing als during  of which ten were acquired as of december  the results of these communities are reflected in the company s income statement from the date of acquisition and therefore  do not reflect a full year of operations until segment operating contribution is calculated by subtracting the segment operating expenses from the segment revenues

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nm not meaningful year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the highlights of the company s results of operations are as follows the free standing als increased revenue and community operating contribution  primarily as a result of a increase in revenue per unit  as well as an increase in occupancy from to during the period from december to december the increased revenue per unit in free standing als resulted primarily from selling rate increases  reduced discounting  and turnover of units resulting in new residents paying higher current market rates 
in addition  current resident agreements contain annual rate increases typically to 
the increased amount of ancillary services including therapy services  has also contributed to the increased revenue per unit 
the free standing al incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for versus while free standing al results improved significantly  the free standing al portfolio must continue to increase its operating contribution margin in order for the company to service its future debt service obligations and return to profitability 
the company is focusing on increasing the free standing al community operating contribution further primarily by increasing occupancy above the current level  and by increasing revenue per unit through price increases  ancillary services  and turnover of units that are at lower rates 
the company believes that  absent unforeseen market or pricing pressures  occupancy increases above should produce high incremental community operating contribution margins for this segment 
the primary risk to improving occupancy in the free standing al portfolio is development of new unit capacity or renewed price discounting by competitors in the company s markets  which would make it more difficult to fill vacant units and which could result in lower revenue per unit 
retirement center community operating contribution increased significantly over the prior year  primarily as a result of increased revenue per unit and occupancy increases 
revenues were up in versus the prior year  community operating expenses were up  resulting in operating margins increasing from to  for the company s largest segment 
revenue per unit increases at the retirement centers are primarily a result of increases to selling rates  increased therapy and ancillary service billings  as well as annual billing rate increases to existing residents typically under most resident agreements 
in addition  a significant component of the average revenue per unit increase is the mark to market effect as a result of resident turnover 
since monthly rates for new residents current market selling rates are generally higher than billing rates to current residents since annual increases to billing rates are typically capped in resident agreements  turnover typically results in a significantly increased monthly fee as a unit is rented to a new resident 
this mark to market increase is generally more significant in ef communities due to much longer average length of stay years 
the operating contribution from the management services segment increased primarily as a result of improved results at freedom square  the company s largest managed community 
in september  the company completed a refinancing transaction that resulted in the repayment of approximately of the mezzanine loan  reducing the balance at december  to million 
as a result  the company replaced a portion of the mezzanine loan with lower cost  longer term leases  reducing the company s overall cost of capital and partially addressing debt maturities 
while the company s income statement shows significant improvement in operating income versus the prior year  the company continues to incur high costs related to interest and lease obligations  and incurred a net loss of million  despite million of gains on the sale of certain properties 
during the fourth quarter of the company reported a net loss of million  which was not affected by any significant gain on the sale of properties 
in order to reduce its loss and produce net income in the future  the company is focusing primarily on reducing its debt service costs and improving results in its free standing al and retirement center segments  while controlling its general and administrative costs 
the company must increase occupancy in its free standing al segment  and increase revenue per unit through increased rates and reduced discounting  while controlling its operating costs 
the company intends to increase ancillary services and revenue per unit in its retirement center segment  increase occupancy at selected communities  and control its operating costs  including labor  insurance and liability related costs 
retirement centers revenue retirement center revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase is made up primarily of selling rate increases and increased ancillary services provided to residents including a million increase in therapy services 
rate increases include the impact of increased medicare reimbursement rates for skilled nursing and therapy  the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling these units at higher current selling rates and annual increases in monthly service fees from existing residents 
the company expects selling rates to new residents will continue to increase during  subject to market conditions 
million from increased occupancy 
the year to year increase in average occupancy was units 
this included the partial year impact of converting two alabama somerby communities  which were previously managed  to a lease during august  and the change of the parkplace community from owned to managed during september occupancy of the segment at december  was 
any occupancy gains above this level should produce significant incremental operating contributions 
the company is focused on maintaining this high level of occupancy across the portfolio  and making incremental occupancy gains at three communities with recent expansions not yet filled units remain unfilled at these three communities at december  and at selected other communities with below average occupancy levels 
million of other net decreases  which is primarily a million decrease from divestitures of certain home health agencies  partially offset by other increases 
community operating expenses retirement center community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million of labor and related costs 
this increase is primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates  as well as approximately additional employees  and the additional staffing costs of approximately million supporting the growth of the therapy services programs 
the company does not expect significant changes in staffing levels in this segment  other than to support expansions or the growth of ancillary programs such as therapy 
wage rates of associates are expected to increase each year  subject to market conditions 
million of increased marketing costs 
this increase is a result of expansions at three communities  and additional marketing staff and other expenditures at selected communities 
million of increased utility costs  including significant increases incurred at various communities in texas 
million of other year to year cost increases 
this includes increases in insurance  food  property taxes  and other property related costs 
community operating contribution retirement center operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or the operating contribution margin increased from in  to in  an increase of 
the margin of decreased during primarily as a result of larger increases in labor and employee benefit costs  as well as increased insurance and liability related costs 
the increased margin in primarily relates to continued operational improvements throughout the retirement centers segment resulting from increased occupancy and revenue per occupied unit including continued growth of the therapy services program  and control of community operating expenses including labor  employee benefits and insurance related costs 
free standing als revenue free standing al revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  which was comprised of million from increased revenue per occupied unit 
this increase includes the impact of price increases  reduced discounting and promotional allowances  and the mark to market effect from turnover of residents reselling these units at higher current rates  and includes million related to increased revenues from therapy services 
the company will be focused on increasing revenue per occupied unit  subject to market constraints  through price increases  as well as the mark to market turnover of residents with prior discounted rates  and an increase in ancillary services such as therapy 
million from increased occupancy 
occupancy increased from at december  to at december   an increase of 
the company is focused on continuing to increase the occupancy in the free standing al communities  and believes that over the long term  this segment of the industry should be able to achieve average occupancy levels at or near those achieved in the retirement center segment 
the company is focused on increasing its number of move ins  increasing average length of stay  and expanding its marketing efforts and sales training in order to increase occupancy 
these amounts are net of the revenue and occupancy for three communities held for sale  which are included as a component of discontinued operations and two free standing als owned through unconsolidated joint ventures 
community operating expenses free standing al community operating expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  which was comprised of million of labor and labor related costs 
this increase is primarily a result of wage rate increases for associates and additional staffing costs of approximately million supporting the growth of the therapy services programs 
the company does not expect significant increases in staffing levels in this segment if occupancy levels increase over the current  since most communities are nearly fully staffed at current occupancy levels and accordingly  additional occupancies will not result in a significant staffing need for the company 
however  growth of ancillary revenue programs such as therapy may require additional staff to support incremental activity 
higher recruiting and retention costs of qualified personnel increase expectations that of increased wage rates each year  subject to labor market conditions 
million of food costs  primarily as a result of increased occupancy 
food costs will continue to increase in relation to occupancy 
million of other net cost decreases 
this includes decreased marketing expenses as certain communities reach stabilized occupancy levels  and various other cost decreases 
community operating contribution free standing al operating contribution was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the operating contribution margin increased from in  to in  an increase of 
the increased margin in primarily relates to strong increases in revenue per occupied unit and some occupancy increases  coupled with control of community operating expenses 
the incremental increase in operating contribution as a percentage of revenue increase was for versus the company believes that  absent unforeseen cost pressures  revenue increases resulting from occupancy increases should produce high incremental community operating contribution margins as a percentage of sales increase for this segment 
management services management services revenues and operating contribution were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily related to improved operating results at freedom square  a managed community in florida 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is related to lower consulting and legal costs versus costs incurred during related to consummation of the transactions comprising the refinancing plan  offset by higher administrative costs resulting from expanded compliance and regulatory requirements 
the company s accruals for costs under its self insured medical plan was reduced in versus  which was partially offset by increased accruals for liability and workers compensation claims 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues decreased to for from for  a decrease of 
the company believes that measuring general and administrative expense as a percentage of total consolidated revenues and combined revenues including unconsolidated managed revenues provides insight as to the level of the company s overhead in relation to its total operating activities including those that relate to management services 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of total combined revenues decreased to from for the year ended december  and  respectively  calculated as follows year ended december  total consolidated revenues   revenues of unconsolidated managed communities   less management fees   total combined revenue   total general and administrative expense   general and administrative expense as a of total consolidated revenues general and administrative expense as a of total combined revenue lease expense 
lease expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or

the primary uses of cash for the company s ongoing operations include the payment of community operating expenses  including labor costs and related benefits  general and administrative costs  lease and interest payments  principal payments required under various debt agreements  refunds due as residents terminate entrance fee contracts  working capital requirements  and capital expenditures necessary to maintain the company s buildings and equipment 
as a result of the refinancing plan  although the company satisfied all its debt maturing in  the company remains highly leveraged with substantial debt and lease obligations 
the company incurred additional debt and lease obligations and most of them at increased interest rates  including the mezzanine loan which carries a interest rate paid currently 
the company is highly leveraged and has substantial payment commitments for lease  interest  principal and other payments on outstanding debt and lease obligations 
as shown in the future cash commitments table below  the company has significant payment obligations during the next five years 
these commitments and the company s plans regarding them are described below the company s long term debt payments include recurring principal amortization and other amounts due each year plus various maturities of mortgages and other loans 
long term debt payments include mortgage debt payments due of million in  million in and million in the company intends to repay or refinance these amounts as they come due  subject to available funds and market conditions 
the long term debt payments include  in addition to other debt payments  the maturity of the remaining million of the mezzanine loan  plus the deferred interest described below 
this loan may be prepaid without penalty beginning in september the company previously negotiated and prepaid million on this loan during september since the mezzanine loan accrues interest at  the company is focused on refinancing it at its earliest opportunity  if acceptable refinancing alternatives are available 
these alternatives may include sale leaseback or sale manage back transactions  mortgage financing  or other alternatives 
refinancing this loan prior to september would require permission from the lender  of which there can be no assurance 
future accrued interest on mezzanine loan represents the future accrual of interest on the mezzanine loan 
of the interest on the loan  the company currently pays  with accrued but deferred until maturity or prepayments 
it is the company s plan to refinance this amount as part of the refinancing of the underlying principal on this loan as described above 
the balance of the interest accrued from december  until the september maturity is million 
the balance as of september  the beginning of the period when prepayment of the loan is permitted  is million 
the long term debt payments include million due on notes to certain former joint venture partners 
the payments also include million of series b notes  which are convertible into shares of common stock of the company at per share 
during  million of these notes were retired through such conversions 
in addition  the company issued a notice of redemption during march for million of the series b notes 
the company will pay the notes so redeemed in march from its cash on hand or from funds from operations 
however  based on recent prices for the company s stock  the company anticipates that most holders will exercise their conversion rights prior to redemption 
the company may issue additional redemption notices in the future for the remaining series b notes 
lease financing obligations and operating leases as of december   the company leases of its communities and leases certain equipment 
as a result  the company incurs significant lease payments from these long term leases 
the company intends to fund these lease obligations primarily from cash provided by operations 
debt associated with assets held for sale of million is mortgage debt that will be repaid from sale proceeds of the related properties held for sale 
as of december   the company had approximately million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and million of working capital 
the company believes that its current cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  the proceeds from the sale of certain assets currently held for sale  and the proceeds from additional financing transactions or earnouts will be sufficient to fund its operating requirements  capital expenditure requirements  periodic debt service requirements  and lease obligations during the next twelve months 
since the company is highly leveraged  the cash needs for lease and interest payments  and principal payments on outstanding debt will remain very high for the foreseeable future and be a significant burden on the company 
in order to meet its liquidity requirements over the longer term  including its debt maturities  the company is focusing on increasing its cash flow from operations the current level of cash generated by operations will not be sufficient to meet the future debt service levels of the company 
the company is focused on increasing its cash flow from operations primarily by increasing its occupancy levels primarily at its free standing al communities and revenue per unit at all communities through periodic selling rate increases and additional services  while controlling operating expenses and maintaining strong entrance fee sales 
refinancing certain debt maturities as they come due it will be very important that the operational results of the company  industry and economic conditions  and capital market conditions enable the company to refinance various debt maturities as they come due in future years 
given the high leverage of the company  cash flow from operations will not be sufficient to repay all of the company s debt maturities in full as they come due 
reducing its cost of capital as a result of the completion of the refinancing plan the company significantly increased its leverage and average cost of capital for various debt and lease obligations 
the company is continuously exploring opportunities to reduce its leverage and average debt cost by refinancing high cost debt  including the high cost mezzanine loan 
although approximately of the company s debt currently has fixed rates  given the company s significant leverage  increases in interest rates could materially increase its future debt service costs 
as a result of operating losses  the company has not incurred significant tax payments in recent years 
although the company has operating loss carryforwards at december   future operational results and transactional activity could result in tax liabilities in future years 
the company may also consider  from time to time  development or acquisition of additional senior living communities or other assets 
such transactions  if significant  would generally require arrangement of separate leases  mortgages or other financing by the company 
a significant amount of the company s indebtedness and lease agreements is cross defaulted 
any non payment or other default with respect to such obligations including non compliance with a financial or restrictive covenants could cause the company s lenders to declare defaults  accelerate payment obligations or foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or exercise their remedies with respect to such communities 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in most of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its debt instruments or lease agreements is likely to result in a default or acceleration of many of the company s other obligations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
certain of the company s loans and leases contain financial and other covenants 
the company believes that projected results from operations and cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy these covenants during fiscal however  there can be no assurances that the company will remain in compliance with those covenants or that the company s creditors will grant amendments or waivers in the event of future non compliance 
the company has primarily used a combination of mortgage financing including the mezzanine loan  lease financing  and convertible debentures to finance its cash needs over the past several years

at december   the company had long term debt  including current portion and debt associated with assets held for sale  of million and was obligated to pay minimum rental obligations in of approximately million under long term operating leases 
the company has current scheduled debt principal payments for of million  as well as million of debt associated with assets held for sale of which only million is due within the next twelve months by its terms  plus substantial payments due under its lease obligations 
for the year ended december   the company s net cash provided by continuing operations was negative 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet required interest  principal  and lease payments in future periods 
certain of the company s current debt agreements and leases contain various financial and other restrictive covenants  which may restrict the company s flexibility in operating its business 
any payment or other default with respect to such obligations could cause lenders to cease funding and accelerate payment obligations or to foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate the lease  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to the company 
while the company endeavors to comply with all financial covenant requirements  there can be no assurance that the company s creditors will grant amendments or waivers in the event of non compliance 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in certain of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations could result in default or acceleration of several of the company s other obligations 
failure to remain in compliance with its financial covenants could have a material adverse impact on the company 
ability to refinance debt obligations given the high leverage of the company  cash flow from continuing operations will not be sufficient to repay all debt maturities in full as they come due 
the company will need the ability to refinance certain debt maturities as they come due 
the ability for the company to refinance debt obligations may be impacted by its operational results  industry and economic conditions  capital market conditions  and other factors that may not be in the company s control 
the inability of the company to refinance various debt maturities as they come due in future years could have a material adverse impact on the company and its financial condition 
ability to increase cash flow from operations the company has experienced significant losses from operations during the past several years  and must increase its cash flow from operations in order to meet its future debt and lease payment obligations 
these increases are contingent on the company s ability to increase its occupancy especially in its free standing al communities  and to increase its revenue per unit through rate increases and additional fees and services 
the free standing al segment of the senior living industry experienced significant overcapacity and price discounting between and  and the company experienced significant losses associated with the fill up of its free standing als most of which began operations during and during this time 
increasing cash flow from operations will also be contingent on the company s ability to derive significant entrance fee sales each year through the remarketing of available units at its ef communities  and to maintain and increase the price level of these units 
cash flow from continuing operations may also be impacted by increases in the company s operating and overhead costs  many of which are beyond the company s control  unless these increases can be recovered through rate increases 
in addition  changes in amounts reimbursed under programs such as medicare and medicaid may have an adverse impact on the company in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase occupancy  increase cash through entrance fee sales  raise billing rates  and control its costs in order to increase its cash flow from operations 
liability insurance and risks of liability claims the delivery of personal and health care services entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  participants in the senior living and health care services industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories  many of which involve large claims and result in the incurrence of significant defense costs and significant exposure 
the company currently maintains property  liability and professional medical malpractice insurance policies for the company s owned  leased and certain of its managed communities under a master insurance program 
the number of insurance companies willing to provide general liability and professional liability insurance for the nursing and assisted living industry has declined dramatically and the premiums and deductibles associated with such insurance has risen substantially in recent years 
in addition  the company maintains programs for worker compensation and employee medical coverage which are partially self insured 
there can be no assurance that the current level of accruals will be adequate to cover the actual liabilities that may be incurred by the company 
there can be no assurance that a claim in excess of the company s insurance coverage limits will not arise 
a claim against the company not covered by  or in excess of  the company s coverage limits could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain adequate liability insurance in the future or that  if such insurance is available  it will be available on acceptable terms 
community management  staffing  and labor costs the company competes with other providers of senior living and health care services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of the company s communities and skilled technical personnel responsible for providing resident care 
in certain markets  a shortage of nurses or trained personnel has required the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of such personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
the company will also be heavily dependent on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates 
the company has experienced a competitive labor market  periodic shortages of qualified workers in certain markets  and increasing wage rates for many of these employees 
the company cannot be sure its labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified management and staff personnel  control its labor costs  or pass on increased labor costs to residents through rate increases  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
exposure to rising interest rates future indebtedness  from commercial banks or otherwise  and lease obligations  including those related to reit facilities  are expected to be based on interest rates prevailing at the time such debt and lease arrangements are obtained 
as of december   the company had million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
the company has million of rate debt at december  however  million of the variable rate debt agreements contain interest rate floors which allow market interest rates to fluctuate without necessarily changing the company s interest rate 
therefore  considering the million of variable rate debt without such interest rate floors  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  increases in prevailing interest rates would increase the company s interest or lease payment obligations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
loss of key officers the company relies upon the services of its executive officers 
the loss of some of our executive officers and the inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel could affect our ability to manage our business and could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
termination of residency agreements the company s residency agreements with its independent living residents other than entrance fee contracts are generally for a term of one year terminable by the resident upon to days written notice 
although most residents remain for many years  the company does not contract with residents for longer periods of time 
if a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time  then company revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 
dependence on attracting residents with sufficient resources to pay approximately of the company s total revenues for were attributable to private pay sources 
the company expects to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for the company s services from their personal or family financial resources and long term care insurance 
future economic or investment market conditions or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for the company s services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks associated with lifecare benefits six of the communities operated by the company are lifecare ef communities that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined from actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for the communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of the communities would be adversely affected 
residents of the company s ef communities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although the company screens potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to the communities during their lifetime  there can be no assurance that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  the company has rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that the communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of the communities  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
risks of operations in concentrated geographic areas part of the company s business strategy is to own  lease or manage senior living communities in concentrated geographic service areas 
the company has a large concentration of communities in florida  texas  arizona and colorado  among other areas 
accordingly  the company s operating results may be adversely affected by various regional and local factors  including economic conditions  real estate market conditions  competitive conditions  and applicable laws and regulations 
government regulation and the burdens of compliance federal and state governments regulate various aspects of the company s business 
the development and operation of senior living communities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal  state  and local licensure  certification  and inspection laws 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement  the imposition of fines  temporary suspension of admission of new patients  restrictions on operating or marketing entrance fee communities  suspension or decertification from medicare  medicaid  or other state or federal reimbursement programs  restrictions on the company s ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities  or revocation of a community s license 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be subject to penalties in the future  or that federal  state  or local governments will not impose restrictions on the company s activities that could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing  investing  and cash management activities 
the company utilizes a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage its exposures to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value of the debt  but not earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value of the debt  but do affect the future earnings and cash flows 
the company generally does not prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity without penalty 
therefore  interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant impact on the fixed rate debt until the company is required to refinance such debt 
the company has million of variable rate debt at december  however  million of the variable rate debt agreements contain interest rate floors which allow market interest rates to fluctuate without necessarily changing the company s interest rate 
therefore  considering the million of variable rate debt without such interest rate floors  each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately  the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  since of the company s debt has fixed rates 
there can be no assurances  however  that interest rates will not significantly change and materially affect the company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to manage its exposure 
the swap involves the receipt of a fixed interest rate payment in exchange for the payment of a variable rate interest payment without exchanging the notional principal amount 
receipts on the agreement are recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
under the agreement  the company receives a fixed rate of on the million of debt  and pays a floating rate stated by the swap agreement based upon libor and a foreign currency index with a maximum rate of 
disclosure about market exchange risk the company received notice from the new york stock exchange nyse in december that it was below the nyse s continued listing requirements relating to total market capitalization of million and minimum shareholder s equity of million 
as permitted by the nyse  the company submitted a plan during early demonstrating how the company intends to comply with the continued listing requirements 
the nyse accepted the company s plan and is monitoring the company s progress during the eighteen month period ending june in addition  the nyse has recently amended its continued listing requirements to increase the required market capitalization and minimum shareholder s equity from million each to million each 
if the company s common stock is not eligible for trading on the nyse  the liquidity and value of its common stock could be adversely affected 
should the company s shares cease to be traded on the nyse  the company believes an alternative trading market will be available for its common stock 
if the company s common stock were not listed or quoted on another market or exchange  trading in the company s common stock would be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities 
as a result  an investor would find it more difficult to trade  or to obtain accurate quotations for the price of  the company s common stock 
if the company is not able to have its common stock listed or quoted on another acceptable market or exchange  the liquidity and value of its common stock would be adversely affected
