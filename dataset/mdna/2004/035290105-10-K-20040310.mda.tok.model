critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas that either require significant judgement by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  our estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve as stated below customers that have refused to pay their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  higher lower than expected defaults or an unexpected material change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at january   and january   the company reported inventory of million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews the excess inventory and makes an assessment of the realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected usage during the next twenty four months  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances change ie  unexpected shift in market demand  pricing or customer defaults  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventory 
deferred tax assets the company applies a three year cumulative taxable income test for foreign subsidiaries whose results are not included in the us tax return in determining whether to recognize an 
table of contents income tax benefit for their respective foreign nol carryforwards  with a resultant adjustment to the valuation allowance 
qualitative factors surrounding a particular subsidiary are also examined  and in certain circumstances eg  projections of further losses for that subsidiary in the short term  an income tax benefit may not be recorded and therefore  the valuation allowance not adjusted  even when the three year cumulative taxable income is positive for a given subsidiary 
life insurance policies anixter implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan on january  the plan permits selected employees to make pre tax deferrals of salary and bonus 
the plan provides for benefit payments upon retirement  death  disability  termination or other scheduled dates determined by the participant 
concurrent with the implementation of the deferred compensation plan  anixter purchased variable  separate account life insurance policies on the lives of the participants 
to fund additional liabilities  anixter purchased fixed  general account increasing whole life insurance policies on the lives of certain participants in both the deferred compensation plan and an executive excess defined benefit plan 
anixter owns all of the above policies and pays level annual premiums on them 
policy proceeds are payable to anixter upon the insured participant s death 
the cash surrender values on those policies are updated quarterly 
as of january  and january   the cash surrender value of million and million  respectively  was recorded under this program and reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at market value 
the company s investment in the cash surrender value program is liquid and redeemable in whole or part by surrendering the underlying life insurance policies 
as the life insurance policies are recorded at market value  changes in the market value of the underlying securities can have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
pension expense the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of the company s pension benefit cost relates to its defined benefit plan in the united states 
in  the company made a million contribution to the plan 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of the net benefit cost from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets  as significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
over the long term  the company s pension plan assets have earned in excess of  therefore  the company believes that its assumption of future returns of is reasonable 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost 
the plan assets actually produced a return of approximately in if significant  the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the return on assets assumption is an increase in our pension expense of approximately million 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at january   the company determined this rate to be 
as of january   the company s consolidated pension liability was million  up from million at the end of for the year ended january   the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million  up from million in as a result of the decline in the assumed rate of return on the pension plan assets  a reduced discount rate and other actuarial gains and losses  the company estimates its net periodic cost to increase by to 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the discount rate assumption is an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at january  of million 

table of contents tax contingencies the company believes it has a reasonable basis in the tax law for all of the positions it takes on the various tax returns it files 
however  in recognition of the fact that various taxing authorities may take opposing views on some issues  that the costs and hazards of litigation in maintaining the positions that the company has taken on various returns might be significant and that the taxing authorities may prevail in their attempts to overturn such positions  the company maintains tax reserves 
the amounts of such reserves  the potential issues they are intended to cover and their adequacy to do so are topics of frequent review internally and with outside tax professionals 
where necessary  periodic adjustments are made to such reserves to reflect the lapsing of statutes of limitations  closings of ongoing examinations or the commencement of new examinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign currencies  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income 
see note interest rate agreements and foreign currency forward contracts and note debt to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on interest agreements and outstanding debt obligations 
approximately of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currency in and approximately in and as of january   the company had a significant amount of short term assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the absolute value of these short term assets and liabilities at january  were approximately million 
the company has purchased approximately million of short term foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
if there was a percent adverse change in the exchange rates  the company would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
the company has entered into interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap  for a period of time  the london interbank offered rate libor component of the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate obligations 
as a result  the interest rate on and of debt obligations at january  and january   respectively  was fixed or capped 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates and a percent adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively  and decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in and  respectively 
the estimated fair market value of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt at january  and january  was and million  respectively 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would decrease by or increase by  respectively  for changes in the market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
these analyses did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analyses assume no changes in the company s financial structure
