sales were also helped by broad based growth in most of the health care segment and growth related to construction and home improvement home care in the consumer and office segment 
electro and communications was the only segment to report a decrease in sales revenues as the telecommunications industry remained weak in refer to the performance by business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective segments 
asia pacific local currency sales increased  with the strongest growth in china and korea 
all seven business segments contributed to this increase 
us sales revenue improved  with growth in five of the seven segments  but overall growth was held back by the continued softness in the industrial and electro and communications segments 
foreign currency translation positively impacted european sales by and asia pacific sales by  as the us dollar weakened against these currencies 
refer to the performance by geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the respective regions 
operating income in increased by versus  as six of seven business segments posted increases 
the combination of solid sales growth  positive benefits from m s corporate initiatives and savings from the last piece of the corporate restructuring program drove the operating income increase 
these initiatives six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration  eproductivity and indirect cost control contributed over million in aggregate operating income benefits in currency impacts  related primarily to the weaker us dollar  boosted operating income by an estimated million  although the company absorbed a similar amount of expenses via a series of productivity actions 
m generated billion of operating cash flows in  a million increase over  and ended the year with billion of cash and cash equivalents 
cash flow in was driven by improved net income  working capital improvements and tax timing differences 
in  the company utilized billion of cash to repurchase m common stock and pay dividends  and contributed million to its pension plans 
m s debt to total capital ratio total capital defined as debt plus equity as of december   was approximately 
m has an aa credit rating from standard poor s and an aa credit rating from moody s investors service 
in  m will continue to focus on improving its top line growth rate  with primary emphasis on driving higher organic  or core  growth 
m is looking for broader based product performance to contribute to its growth  in addition to expected continued growth in optical film products  and will also continue to assess potential acquisitions 
stronger core growth will require both faster growth of existing products services and successful introduction of new products  including sales of m s immune response modifier pharmaceutical to treat two new indications superficial basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis once anticipated regulatory approval has been obtained 
the company also is focused on its corporate initiatives to improve productivity and reduce costs 
m s corporate initiatives are expected to contribute an additional million to operating income in increased pension expense is expected to reduce operating income by approximately million 
as in and  the company will consider the need for additional contributions to its pension plans 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact results  although the company expects to hedge about half of this impact 
m will also continue  as it has for many years  to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies 
by improving organic sales volume growth  driving its costs and productivity initiatives  and making appropriate disciplined acquisitions  m expects to achieve solid growth in sales and income for these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected refer to the forward looking statements discussion later in item for discussion of these risks and uncertainties

corporate initiatives in  the company continued to drive its five corporate initiatives six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration  eproductivity and indirect cost control aimed at accelerating long term top line growth  improving cash flow and lowering its total cost structure 
six sigma focuses on higher growth  productivity and cash flow 
global sourcing effectiveness generates savings by leveraging purchasing economies of scale  aggressively enforcing supply agreements  geographic broadening and e applications 
through its m acceleration initiative  the company is driving towards more and better new product ideas and faster  more impactful new product introductions  along with reallocating research and development resources to larger  more global projects 
in eproductivity  m believes it has a significant opportunity to improve productivity for its customers  suppliers and for m itself 
indirect cost control focuses on reducing costs not directly associated with products or s ervices 
in  the company estimates its corporate initiatives could contribute an additional million to operating income 
there can be no assurance that all of the estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
numerous factors may create offsets to these savings  such as the potential for weakness in sales volumes  normal increases in compensation and benefits  and other inflationary pressures 
the company estimates that these initiatives provided a combined benefit to operating income of more than million in  after contributing more than million to operating income in corporate restructuring program the corporate restructuring program actions were substantially completed by june  the company estimates incremental savings under this plan of approximately million on a pre tax basis in  primarily in the first half of the year 
the company estimates incremental savings of million on a pre tax basis in  in addition to the million saved in the majority of these savings were from reduced employee costs 
information regarding the restructuring is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

acquisitions increased sales by nearly  driven primarily by the december acquisition of corning precision lens  inc on a geographic basis  core volume growth was strongest in the asia pacific area 
refer to both the performance by business segment and performance by geographic area sections for additional discussion of sales change 
in  the asia pacific area led core volume growth  driven by the display and graphics  health care  industrial and transportation segments 
core volume declined in the united states  with weak overall sales in electro and communications  and industrial segments partially offset by good growth in the health care and transportation segments 
core volume in europe also declined  hurt by the continuing downturn in the telecom industry  partially offset by higher growth in the health care segment 
operating expenses versus versus percent of net sales cost of sales selling  general and administrative expenses research  development and related expenses other expense income operating income cost of sales in benefited from six sigma and other projects aimed at improving manufacturing throughput  yield and productivity 
m s global sourcing initiative has helped mitigate the impact of raw material price increases 
raw material costs were essentially flat versus in  gross margins were positively impacted by improved plant efficiencies and lower raw material costs  again helped by m s global sourcing initiative 
special items  as a percent of sales  negatively impacted cost of sales by percentage points in and percentage points in cost of sales includes manufacturing  engineering and freight costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of net sales has improved in each of the past two years 
sg a expenses in us dollars were higher in due to currency translation  as well as increased advertising and merchandising spending 
the improvement in sg a costs was the result of implementing six sigma  indirect cost control programs  and employment reductions under the restructuring plan approved in june sg a also benefited by million in due to the cessation of goodwill amortization and other indefinite lived asset amortization effective january  special items negatively impacted sg a in and million  or of sales in  million  or of sales in 
excluding these special items  sg a for was relatively flat as a percent of sales compared with other expense income includes items previously discussed under special items 
for  this reflects the million pre tax charge related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against m in by lepage s inc for  this includes a reversal of a litigation accrual of million  and a gain of million related to the net impact of the sale and write down of available for sale equity securities 
operating income m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools 
operating income has steadily improved the last two years  and in was of sales 
although the company faced continued economic weakness  operating income grew by million in  or

interest expense and income millions interest expense interest income total interest expense the slight increase in interest expense was primarily due to a reduced benefit for capitalized interest related to lower capital spending and higher average debt balances being largely offset by lower interest rates 
declining interest rates on floating rate debt drove the reduction in expense in interest income while average cash balances were higher in  interest income decreased due to lower interest rates 
the increase in was primarily related to larger average cash balances 
provision for income taxes percent of pretax income effective tax rate income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash from outside the united states negatively impacted the income tax rate 
minority interest millions minority interest minority interest represents the elimination of the non m ownership interests  primarily in sumitomo m limited and m inter unitek gmbh in and only 
the decrease in relates to m s purchase of the minority interest shares of m inter unitek gmbh in december and the purchase of an additional ownership in sumitomo m in early refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these acquisitions

products provided to these markets include medical and surgical supplies  skin health and infection prevention products  pharmaceuticals  drug delivery systems  dental and orthodontic products  health information systems  microbiology products  and closures for disposable diapers 
in  local currency growth and total sales growth in the health care segment was broad based 
geographic area local currency growth was led by the asia pacific area and the latin america  africa and canada area  with the united states and europe showing moderate growth 
operating income improvement was also broad based 
in the pharmaceuticals business  an agreement was reached with eli lilly and company in september of to collaborate on resiquimod  an investigational compound for the treatment of genital herpes 
m received million in the fourth quarter of from lilly in consideration for research and development efforts 
revenue was recognized on a pro rata basis over the service period 
m recognized million of revenue relating to this agreement in  million in and million in in the third quarter of  m and eli lilly reached a final agreement to return control of resiquimod to m 
upon termination of the agreement  m recognized the remaining revenue with deferral of some immaterial remaining obligations 
m continues to evaluate its strategic options with respect to this potential treatment 
the broader family of immune response modifiers continues to progress and m expects approval of two new indications for aldara imiquimod cream   in these new indications are for actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma  potentially serious skin conditions that are a direct result of cumulative sun exposure 
the patent and related rights for the imiquimod molecule are important to the health care business 
if approved by the fda  the company expects significant sales beginning in for aldara imiquimod cream   for the treatment of actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma 
the original patent on the imiquimod molecule expires in august  but the patent term extension runs through august in october  ivax corporation agreed to assume exclusive rights to m s branded health care respiratory products  together with related marketing and sales personnel  in nine european countries 
the agreement covers qvar beclomethasone dipropionate hfa inhalation aerosol  a maintenance medication used to prevent asthma attacks  and also covers airomir albuterol sulfate inhaler  a rescue medication used to relieve acute asthma symptoms 
m will continue to manufacture and supply these products to ivax 
the total consideration due under the agreement  including minimum annual royalty payments  was million  of which million was paid in m expects to receive million in both and  and million in m may also receive additional royalty payments up to a maximum of approximately million in total if ivax achieves certain annual sales levels 
in  the combined benefit from both the eli lilly agreement and the ivax corporation agreement was partially offset by separation costs in health care  resulting in a net benefit to operating income of approximately million 
in  sales and operating income growth was led by medical  dental and pharmaceutical products 
local currency growth was negatively impacted by generic competition for m s tambocor flecainide acetate pharmaceutical product 
in december  m acquired the remaining of outstanding shares of m inter unitek gmbh parent company of m espe dental ag 
because these results have been consolidated since when m acquired of this business  this additional acquisition of the remaining shares had no impact on sales or operating income of the health care segment

employment reduction actions taken to improve competitiveness and lower the industrial segment s cost structure negatively impacted operating income by million 
in  economic weakness in most areas of the manufacturing economy was the leading cause of the slight decrease in sales compared to despite this weakness  effective cost control and increased efficiency led to an increase in operating income 
electronic materials  dyneon brand materials and industrial tape products contributed to the operating income growth 
during the third quarter of  m finalized the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of polymer manufacturing  inc  emtech emulsion technologies  inc and emtech manufacturing corporation 
acquisitions benefited sales by 
display and graphics business of consolidated sales sales millions    sales change analysis local currency volume and price translation total sales change operating income millions percent change percent of sales the display and graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display  touch screen  traffic safety and commercial graphics

the optical business includes a number of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents 
the remaining lifetimes of such patents range from one to greater than years 
these patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to m for a number of such products  but m s proprietary manufacturing technology and know how also provide a competitive advantage to m independent of such patents 
the strong local currency sales growth in the display and graphics segment was primarily due to optical systems growth  including the corning precision lens acquisition that benefited sales by approximately 
optical systems growth was led by sales of display enhancement films used in flat panel devices 
geographic area local currency sales growth was led by the asia pacific area and the latin america  africa and canada area 
local currency growth was moderate in the united states and europe 
optical systems also led display and graphics operating income growth  driven primarily by local currency sales growth and its production facilities running at high utilization levels

local currency growth was led by the construction and home improvement  home care  and stationery products businesses  partially offset by lower local currency sales in the visual systems business 
geographic area local currency growth was moderate in all areas except europe  which showed a decline 
the modest increase in operating income resulted from strong gains in construction and home improvement and home care  partially offset by a decrease in visual systems operating income 
the decrease in local currency growth reflected continued office worker layoffs and inventory contraction in the retail channel affecting office supplies

critical accounting estimates information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as stated in note  the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings  the company s pension and postretirement obligations  and potential asset impairment issues 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
legal proceedings please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings contained in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report on form k for a description of the process the company follows under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance  for the accrual and disclosure of loss contingencies  and the categories of claims for which the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and where applicable  related insurance receivables  and factors affecting such estimates 
pension and postretirement obligations m has various company sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all us employees and many employees outside the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
benefits associated with these plans are based primarily on years of service and  in some cases  employee compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
for the us pension plan  the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is  which is unchanged 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the september   measurement date for the us plan 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
by applying this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of september   which is a reduction of percentage points from the rate used as of september  for the year ended december   the change in the minimum pension liability within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by million after tax 
for the us pension plan  holding all other factors constant  a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would result in an after tax increase decrease of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  up from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to increase to approximately million in  up approximately million from the comparable number in for the us pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million in for the us pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million in potential asset impairment issues management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 
although there is greater risk with respect to the accuracy of these long term estimates and assumptions because of the long period over which actual results will emerge  such risk is mitigated by management s ability to make changes in these estimates and assumptions over the same long period 
m has approximately billion of goodwill that  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
a portion of th is goodwill approximately million is in m s telecommunications business  which the company believes will maintain its value 
however  if unanticipated events impact this sector for an extended period of time  it could create future impairment losses 
financial condition and liquidity the company generates significant ongoing cash flow as evidenced by the reduction in net debt during as follows at december millions total debt    less cash cash equiv 
 net debt    m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures 
the company has an aa credit rating from standard poor s and an aa credit rating from moody s investors service 
the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs 
the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the company s stock 
the company s financial condition and liquidity at december   remain strong 
various assets and liabilities  including cash and short term debt  can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short term liquidity needs 
working capital defined as current assets minus current liabilities totaled billion at december   increasing billion from year end this increase was largely related to an increase in cash billion 
the cash balance benefited from higher net income and certain working capital improvements accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable 
the increase in other current assets was offset by an increase in accrued income taxes 
the increase in other current assets was primarily due to the reclassification of certain insurance receivables from long term to current  and increases in various prepaid items and deferred taxes 
the increase in accrued income taxes primarily relates to higher net i ncome  a higher effective tax rate  and the timing of tax payments 
the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities eg accounts receivable  inventory 
these measures may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the accounts receivable turnover index defined as quarterly net sales fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four  divided by ending net accounts receivable totaled at december   an improvement from at year end receivables increased million compared with year end  with currency translation increasing the accounts receivable balance by million due to the weaker us dollar 
the inventory turnover index defined as quarterly factory cost fourth quarter at year end multiplied by four  divided by ending inventory was at december   an improvement from at year end inventories declined million compared with year end  despite currency translation increasing the inventory balance by million compared with december  cash flows from operating activities years ended december millions net income    depreciation and amortization  company pension contributions  income taxes deferred and accrued income taxes accounts receivable inventories accounts payable other net net cash provided by operating activities   cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period  as pension funding decisions  tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows 
in both and  cash flows were primarily driven by improved net income  certain working capital improvements ie accounts receivables  inventories  accounts payable and tax timing differences 
in and  significant company pension contributions negatively impacted cash flow 
in all years  with larger amounts in and  a portion of the tax timing benefit relates to the tax benefit received from company pension contributions 
in  m made million of payments under the corporate restructuring plan  compared with million in and million in m s pension plan assets were below m s accumulated benefit obligation abo at its most recent plan measurement dates for certain plans 
in the third quarter of  m made a voluntary  special contribution of million to its us qualified pension plan compared with a voluntary  special contribution of million in the third quarter of future contributions will depend on market conditions  interest rates and other factors 
m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities 
the company recorded the lepage s verdict liability of million pre tax in the first quarter of the company increased its estimate of liabilities for the breast implant and respirator mask asbestos claims and litigation in for a more detailed discussion of these and other legal proceedings  refer to part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report on form k

m s guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are estimated at approximately million 
m s accrued product warranty liabilities are estimated at approximately million

while m s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated  these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations as of december   follows contractual obligations payments due by year total after millions long term debt including current portion  operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations  unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company 
included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts  capital commitments  service agreements and utilities 
these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year 
many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers 
the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of m s products and se rvices are purchased as needed  with no unconditional commitment 
for this reason  these numbers will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in thus  company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in and future years 
contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table  but these commitments represent a small part of the company s expected capital spending in and beyond 
for  the company expects to spend approximately million on purchases of property  plant and equipment 
financial instruments the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure  interest rate risks and commodity price risks 
a financial risk management committee  composed of senior management  provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities 
this committee determines the company s financial risk policies and objectives  and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization 
this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation  risk analysis  counterparty credit approval  and ongoing monitoring and reporting 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts  options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions 
the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  the company may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts  price protection swaps and forward physical contracts 
a variance co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a confidence level over a month time horizon 
based on this analysis of the company s interest rate risks  possible changes in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on after tax earnings million at december  and million at december  
based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks  possible changes in foreign exchange rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by million million at december  
when including certain commodity risks  possible changes in commodity rates could adversely impact after tax earnings by an additional million an additional million at december  
the model used analyzed over different currencies and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
the company is increasingly striving to more closely align its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales  which will move costs outside the united states 
this will also help mitigate the effects from currency fluctuations 
in  the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings 
however  this hedging program will not make m immune to currency impacts 
the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
the global energy exposure is such that a price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year

forward looking statements this annual report on form k  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item  contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may be identified by the use of words like plan  expect  aim  believe  project  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could and similar expressions in connection with any discussion  expectation  or projection of future operating or financial performance  events or trends 
in particular  these include statements about the company s strategy for growth  product development  market position  future performance or results of current or anticipated products  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings 
factors that could affect future results forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those projected in any such forward looking statements depending on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the following results and trends are impacted by the effects of  and changes in  worldwide economic conditions 
the company operates in more than countries and derives more than half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the company s business may be affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control  such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or region  social  political or labor conditions in a specific country or region  or potential adverse foreign tax consequences 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the company s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and net earnings and its results of operations 
because the company derives more than half of its revenues from outside the united states  its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and net earnings could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
the company s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings  including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market 
this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development  such as the inability to identify viable new products  obtain adequate intellectual property protection  gain market acceptance of new products  or successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
for example  new m pharmaceutical products  like any pharmaceutical under development  face substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and regulatory review 
there are no guarantees that products will receive regulatory approvals or prove to be commercially successful 
in particular  the company s expectations rely in part on obtaining regulatory approval by about mid year for two additional indications for aldara imiquimod cream  
the company s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs of purchased components and materials due to market demand  currency exchange risks  material shortages and other factors 
the company depends on various components and materials for the manufacturing of its products 
although the company has not experienced any difficulty in obtaining components and materials  it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be terminated in the future 
any sustained interruption in the company s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations due to market demand  currency risks  or material shortages  or that future price fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
there is the possibility that acquisitions  divestitures and strategic alliances may not meet sales and or profit expectations 
as part of the company s strategy for growth  the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and enter into strategic alliances 
however  there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to the company 
the company s future results may be affected if the company receives less savings from its corporate initiatives than estimated 
m s corporate initiatives in  these initiatives included six sigma  global sourcing effectiveness  m acceleration  eproductivity and indirect cost control are expected to contribute an additional million to operating income in there can be no assurance that all of the estimated savings from the initiatives will be realized 
the company s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings  including those involving product liability  antitrust  environmental or other matters 
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the company s expectations because the outcomes of litigation  including regulatory matters  are often difficult to reliably predict 
various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable  or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates  such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment  significant settlement or changes in applicable law 
a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period 
a specific factor that may influence the company s estimate of its future asbestos related liabilities is the pending congressional consideration of legislation to reform asbestos related litigation and pertinent information derived from that process
