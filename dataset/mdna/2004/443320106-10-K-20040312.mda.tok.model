critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies and the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make significant judgments or rely on an estimation process that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
the company bases it estimates on historical experience  current events and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts  cost of purchased transportation and services and reserves for pricing and billing adjustments 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts became known 
the accounting policies that can have a significant impact upon the results of operations  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows allowance for uncollectible trade accounts in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to customers after a review of each customer s credit history 
an allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging  an assessment of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation of the current economic conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from management s estimates due to changes in future economic  industry or customer financial condition 
valuation of long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets many not be recoverable 
an estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset or appropriate group of assets is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
the estimate of future cash flows involves considerable management judgment and is based upon assumptions about anticipated future operating performance 
the actual cash flow could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
valuation of goodwill as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
under statement  goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized 
in accordance with statement  the company reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the company utilizes a third party independent valuation firm to assist in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment testing 
the valuations are based on market capitalization  discounted cash flow analysis or a combination of both methodologies 
the assumptions used by the company in the above valuations include expectations regarding future operating performance  discount rates  control premiums and other factors which are subjective in nature 
as previously mentioned  actual cash flows from operations could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance and economic conditions 
should estimates differ materially from actual results  the company may be required to record impairment charges in the future 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an assessment is made as to the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
as part of this assessment  management has considered tax planning strategies that it believes to be prudent and feasible to allow for the realization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the probability of realizing the deferred tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future  a valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed unrecoverable 
outlook  risks and uncertainties except for historical data  the information contained in this annual report constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to risks 
such statements should be viewed with caution 
actual results or experience could differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
forward looking statements in this report include  but are not limited to  those contained in this outlook  risks and uncertainties section regarding expectations  hopes  beliefs  estimates  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the company assumes no liability to update any such forward looking statements 
in addition to those mentioned elsewhere in this section  such risks and uncertainties include the impact of competitive pressures in the marketplace  including the entry of new  web based competitors and direct marketing efforts by the railroads  marketing efforts of asset based carriers  the degree and rate of market growth in the intermodal  brokerage and logistics markets served by the company  changes in rail and truck capacity  further consolidation of rail carriers  deterioration in relationships with existing rail carriers  rail service conditions  changes in governmental regulation  adverse weather conditions  fuel shortages  changes in the cost of services from rail  drayage and other vendors  changes in homeland security and fluctuations in interest rates 
business combinations divestitures management believes that future acquisitions or dispositions made by the company could significantly impact financial results 
financial results most likely to be impacted include  but are not limited to  revenue  gross margin  salaries and benefits  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  net income and the company s debt level 
financial results may be impacted by additional factors as discussed below 
revenue management believes that the performance of the railroads and a more severe or prolonged slow down of the economy are the most significant factors that could negatively influence the company s revenue growth rate 
should there be further consolidation in the rail industry causing a service disruption  the company believes its intermodal business would likely be negatively impacted 
should there be another significant service disruption similar to the lock out of west coast dock workers in  the company expects there may be some customers who would switch from using the company s intermodal service to other transportation services 
the company expects these customers may choose to continue to utilize other services even when intermodal service levels are restored 
other factors that could negatively influence the company s growth rate include  but are not limited to  the elimination of fuel surcharges  the entry of new web based competitors  inadequate drayage service and inadequate equipment supply 
the company expects that supply chain solutions revenue will continue to increase  however  the company estimates the growth rate may not continue at the same level that was experienced in hub distribution s largest customer  for which hub distribution installs point of purchase displays  has notified the company of a significant change in its volume as compared to prior years 
this has already resulted in a significant decrease in revenue during the first quarter of should these volume levels continue  management believes the revenue for this customer will be at lower levels than those experienced in  which could negatively impact gross margin and profitability 
gross margin management expects fluctuations in the gross margin percentage from quarter to quarter caused by various factors including  but not limited to  changes in business mix  intermodal margins  highway brokerage margins  logistics business margins  trailer and container capacity  vendor pricing  fuel costs  intermodal industry growth  intermodal industry service levels  competition and accounting estimates 
unlike the company s other service offerings  the company s distribution services are comprised of certain higher margin projects 
there can be no assurance these higher margin projects will continue in the future 
salaries and benefits management estimates that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenue could fluctuate from quarter to quarter as there are timing differences between revenue increases and changes in levels of staffing 
should the company eliminate more positions  this expense  as a percent of revenue  is likely to be reduced 
factors that could affect the percentage from staying in the recent historical range include  but are not limited to  revenue growth rates significantly higher or lower than forecasted  a management decision to invest in additional personnel to stimulate new or existing businesses  changes in customer requirements and changes in railroad intermodal service levels which could result in a lower or higher cost of labor per move 
selling  general and administrative management believes there are several factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of revenue 
as customer expectations and the competitive environment require the development of web based business interfaces and the restructuring of the company s information systems and related platforms  the company believes there could be significant expenses incurred  some of which would not be capitalized 
other factors that could cause selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in insurance premiums and litigation expense 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment management estimates that depreciation and amortization of property and equipment will increase in the most significant factors that could cause an increase in depreciation and amortization expense are increased software amortization related to improvements in the company s information systems  lease buyouts and other purchases of computer equipment 
additional factors that could cause an increase in depreciation expense include  but are not limited to  if the company decided to purchase rather than lease a greater proportion of assets or accelerating depreciation due to changes in useful lives of existing assets 
impairment of property and equipment on an ongoing basis  the company assesses the realizability of its assets 
if  at any point during the year  management determines that an impairment exists  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the estimated impairment with a corresponding charge to earnings 
if it is determined that an impairment exists  management estimates that the write down of specific assets could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
other income expense factors that could cause interest expense to fluctuate include  but are not limited to  changes in lending rates  debt repayments  working capital needs  software development expenses and capital expenditures 
management estimates that interest income will likely remain relatively consistent with the prior year 
factors that could cause a change include  but are not limited to  the possible use of cash to make debt repayments  fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that cash to be provided by operations  cash available under the line of credit and the company s ability to obtain additional credit will be sufficient to meet the company s short term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
the company believes that the aforementioned items are sufficient to meet its anticipated long term working capital  capital expenditure and debt repayment needs 
the company estimates that its capital expenditures should not exceed million in during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized the purchase of up to  shares of the company s class a common stock from time to time 
the timing of the program will be determined by the financial and market conditions 
since january  through march  the company has purchased  shares at a cost of million 
further  employees exercised options during which resulted in cash proceeds of approximately million for the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on its bank line of credit and term notes which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize the risk from interest rate volatility through its regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company has both fixed and variable rate debt as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company had an interest rate swap designated as a hedge on a portion of the company s variable rate debt that matured september  the purpose of the swap was to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
a ten percent increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the results of operations for the year ended december  the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile
