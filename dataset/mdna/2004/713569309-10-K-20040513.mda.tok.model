at the november  eitf meeting  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf eitf addresses how to determine if an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the eitf indicated that the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company adopted eitf on january   however  eitf did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in november  fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no

fin no 
does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  certain of the company s sales agreements contain infringement indemnity provisions that are covered by fin no 
under these sales agreements  the company agrees to defend and indemnify a customer in connection with infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of the company s products and services 
the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date and generally limit the award to the amount of fees paid 
the company has not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
also  the company maintains membership in a group captive insurance company for its workers compensation insurance 
the member companies agree to jointly insure the group s liability risks up to a certain threshold 
as a member  the company guarantees to pay an assessment  if an assessment becomes due  as a result of insured losses by its members 
this guarantee will never exceed a percentage of the company s loss funds 
based on the company s historical experience  the company does not anticipate such an assessment 
as a result  the company s estimated fair value of the infringement indemnity provision obligations and the captive insurance guarantee is nominal 
overview of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are the most critical that is  they are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and or they require management s most difficult  subjective and or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition the company s revenue is derived from products and services delivered to the healthcare industry through its two operating divisions physician services provides connective healthcare solutions that manage the revenue cycle for physician groups 
fees for these services are primarily based on a percentage of net collections on our clients accounts receivable 
the division recognizes revenue and bills customers when the customers receive payment on those accounts receivable 
the division also recognizes approximately of its revenue on a monthly service fee and per transaction basis from the physician practice management ppm product line 
the physician services division does not rely  to any material extent  on estimates in the recognition of revenue 
hospital services provides connective healthcare solutions that improve revenue cycle and resource management for hospitals 
revenue cycle management solutions include technology tools that allow a hospital s central billing office cbo to more effectively manage its cash flow and full or partial outsourced solutions 
technology tools include electronic transactions  such as claims processing  that can be delivered via the web or through dedicated electronic data interfaces as well as license based solutions  such as automated cash posting solutions  that are deployed at the cbo 
revenue related to electronic claims and remittance advice processing and real time eligibility verification is recognized on a per transaction basis net of electronic claims rebates paid to connectivity partners 
revenue related to high speed print and mail services is billed and recognized when the division performs these services and includes transaction fees  the division includes all costs of delivering the product in operating expenses 
resource management solutions include staff and patient scheduling solutions that enable hospitals to efficiently manage their resources  such as personnel and the operating room  to reduce costs and improve their bottom line 
for software contracts that require the division to make significant production  modification or customization changes  the division recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method over the implementation period 
when the company receives payment prior to shipment or fulfillment of significant vendor obligations  the company records such payments as deferred revenue and recognizes them as revenue upon shipment or fulfillment of significant vendor obligations 
an unbilled receivable is recorded when the company recognizes revenue on the percentage of completion basis prior to achieving a contracted billing milestone 
for minor add on software license sales where no significant customization remains outstanding  the fee is fixed  an agreement exists and collectibility is probable  the division recognizes revenue upon shipment 
the division defers software maintenance payments received in advance and recognizes them ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  which is typically one year 
the hospital services division relies on estimates of work to be completed when recognizing revenue on contracts using percentage of completion accounting 
because estimates of the extent of completion that differ from actual results could affect revenue  the division periodically reviews the estimated hours or days to complete major projects and compares these estimates to budgeted hours or days to support the revenue recognized on that project 
approximately  and of the division s revenue was determined using percentage of completion accounting for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization and valuation of intangibles amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of client lists  developed technology and software development costs prior to the company s adoption of sfas no

the company bases these estimates on historical experiences  market conditions  expected future revenues and maintenance costs and the products or services provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether to revise estimates of the remaining useful lives of the intangible 
additionally the company evaluates whether any changes would render its intangibles impaired or indicate that an asset has a different useful life 
conditions that may indicate an impairment include an economic downturn or change in future operations 
in the event such a condition exists  the company performs an assessment using a variety of methodologies  including cash flow analysis  estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals
