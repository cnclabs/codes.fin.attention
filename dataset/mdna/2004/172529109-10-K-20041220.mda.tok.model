item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
of the securities and exchange commission  requests that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by ciprico inc the company  we and our 
general management s discussion and analysis of ciprico s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the recoverability of receivables and inventories 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods up to three years 
we accrue a warranty reserve within cost of sales for estimated costs to provide warranty services 
we estimate the costs to service our warranty obligations based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
revenue from the sale of extended warranty and maintenance agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related agreement 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to reduce excess and obsolete inventory to estimated market value based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or expected life of the representative product 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
we do not adjust our lower of cost or market adjustment to inventory components upward once a reduction was determined to be necessary 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment of  to reduce certain legacy product inventory to market value due to excess estimated inventory levels of certain legacy products discontinued during prior years 
warranty our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of each balance sheet date 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that our estimate is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we would increase our warranty accrual resulting in decreased gross profit 
similarly  if the opposite occurs and we experience better than expected results  we would decrease our warranty accrual 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of ciprico inc and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of digital media workflow solutions 
our solutions combine storage  networking and computing technologies to simplify and accelerate digital media workflows 
our primary markets are broadcast and entertainment  which include applications in digital broadcast and film and video production  and military and government  which include applications involving the data capture  processing and dissemination of surveillance images and medical imaging picture archives 
in addition  we have historically sold in other markets with high performance storage requirements such as geosciences and digital prepress 
the following table sets forth certain items from ciprico s consolidated statement of operations  as a percentage of net sales for the years ending september net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations net sales comparative information on sales by market are shown in the charts below in millions 
market sales of total sales of total sales of total broadcast entertainment military government other total sales for were approximately million  a decrease of from sales  which decreased from levels 
sales in the broadcast segment decreased in versus an increase of in from we believe the decrease in was the result of lost business from competitive effects at each of our larger broadcast oems and  to a lesser extent  the result of softer demand within the broadcast industry 
the increase in came substantially from increased sales to three larger oem customers that collectively accounted for million or of our sales in fiscal sales in the military and government market decreased in fiscal versus a decrease of in as compared with the decrease in fiscal and reflects reduced spending levels from system integrators associated with defense related programs due in part to the military action in the middle east 
in  we shipped approximately million of our talon product compared to  in  to new and existing customers in the military segment 
sales in the military segment are to some extent dependent upon the actual appropriation and funding of government programs that specify our products 
we believe our sales in this segment have been adversely impacted by delays in the deployment and funding of certain programs in which our products have been specified 
sales in the military segment have historically fluctuated between years due to the timing of spending on defense related programs 
the sales in the other market segments during the past three years primarily reflects demand from customers in some of our legacy markets such as geoscience  medical imaging and digital prepress 
we believe that our revenue growth in the future is dependent on our ability to provide new products and expand the applications of our products into targeted market segments 
the dimeda family of products was released in and accounted for million and  in sales for and  respectively 
in  we released the fibrestore which accounted for million in sales for  million in and million in the netarray family of products was released in fiscal sales from netarray products were approximately million in  million in and million in cost of sales and gross profit gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was in  in and in the decrease in can primarily be attributed to unfavorable overhead absorption due to lower unit volumes and the impact of a third quarter charge of  to cost of sales and inventory to reduce certain legacy product to market value 
the increase in margins between and are primarily a result of improved efficiencies and overhead absorption due to increased unit volumes and the impacts from expense reduction efforts in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non recurring adjustment of  to reduce certain legacy product inventory to market value 
gross profit on product sales is highly dependent on the cost of disk drives and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we believe our strong vendor relations will aid in component availability and cost reductions to meet continued competitive pricing pressures 
we expect to experience continued competitive pressures on gross profit margins throughout fiscal we intend to partially offset these margin pressures through new product introductions and cost reductions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased approximately million or in compared to a decrease of million or in versus the decreases in and are primarily a result of decreased prototype spending on development projects  a continued shift towards software development activities and reduced staffing levels between years 
we currently do not materially sell software separately from our hardware 
we expect that research and development expenses will decrease slightly in absolute dollars in fiscal based on reduced staffing levels implemented in the second half of fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased approximately million or in versus a decrease of million or in compared to the reduction in both years reflects reduced headcount between years resulting from our restructuring efforts implemented in each of the past three fiscal years  which included the closure of our international sales offices 
in addition  the reduction in expenses during fiscal and reflects reduced spending on trade show and promotional activities 
we expect these expenses to decrease slightly in absolute dollars during fiscal as a result of cost reductions implemented during the third quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  or in this reduction is a result of restructuring efforts implemented during the third quarter of fiscal  a reduction in the allowance for bad debt and a reduction in legal expenses 
expenses decreased approximately  between and we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in fiscal due to anticipated higher insurance costs and increased accounting and audit fees related to sarbanes oxley section compliance 
restructuring during the third quarter of  we implemented a workforce reduction of 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a charge of million  of which approximately million is employee termination costs and million is related to the abandonment of a portion of ciprico s headquarter facility and the write down of certain fixed assets 
in addition the company recorded a non cash adjustment of  to cost of sales and inventory to reduce certain legacy product inventory to market value 
these restructuring efforts are expected to result in annualized cost reductions of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a workforce reduction of  including the closure of our european sales offices 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a charge of  of which approximately  is employee termination costs and  is a non cash charge for cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments recognized in connection with the closure of our european operations 
in september  we implemented a workforce reduction of and further consolidation of our sales operations in europe 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of  of which approximately  is employee termination costs and  is facility closure and related costs 
other income other income of   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  is primarily attributable to interest income on cash and marketable securities 
the decrease between all years reflects overall lower interest rates on lower average cash and investment balances 
income tax expense for fiscal and  no income tax benefit was recognized  as we do not expect to realize any current income tax benefits 
for the income tax benefit of million reflects recognition of current income tax benefits related to federal income tax refunds received or expected to be received under the provisions of the job creation and worker assistance act of the effective income tax expense benefit was in  in and in see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had a total of cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and asset backed short term investments of million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of cash flows used in operating activities were  million and  in  and  respectively 
the use of cash in all years reflects the net loss and the impacts of depreciation and changes working capital 
the change between years primarily reflects fluctuations in working capital levels between years 
capital expenditures were  million and million in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will approximate between  and  due primarily to anticipated spending on product development activities 
there were no shares repurchased in fiscal during and  we repurchased  and  shares  respectively  at a total cost of approximately  and  respectively 
the total amount authorized to be expended under the stock buyback program is million 
as of september    shares of common stock have been repurchased for million 
despite the cost reduction efforts implemented during  we expect to incur an operating loss in fiscal due to continued investments expected in new product development 
we believe that current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be adequate to fund requirements for operating losses  working capital and capital expenditures  and share repurchases  as well as any potential acquisitions in fiscal during fiscal  we signed a year operating lease for a new corporate headquarters  which commenced in october the lease provides for base rental payments of approximately  for the first thirty six months with increases of approximately each subsequent month period 
the lease also includes provisions for early termination after and years 
additionally  we are responsible for our proportionate share of real estate taxes and operating expenses associated with operating the facility  as defined by the lease agreement 
in connection with the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal as discussed in note restructuring activity we expensed approximately million of the lease obligation for the corporate headquarters 
as a result  rent expense will be decreased by approximately   and  for the fiscal years  and  respectively
