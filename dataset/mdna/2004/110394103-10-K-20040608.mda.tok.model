item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risk factors and our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leading provider of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry with major operations in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we also have operations  both directly and indirectly  in most of the other major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including australia  brazil  china  mexico  nigeria and trinidad 
additionally  we are a leading provider of production management services for oil and gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico 
as of march   we operated aircraft and our unconsolidated affiliates operated an additional aircraft throughout the world 
the following table presents our operating results and other income statement information for the fiscal years ended march   and fiscal year ended march  operating revenue    gain on disposal of assets    direct cost    depreciation and amortization    general and administrative    curtailment gain  operating income    earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net    interest expense  net    loss on extinguishment of debt  other income expense  net    income before provision for income taxes and    minority interest provision for income taxes    minority interest    net income    we employ approximately pilots in our north american operations who are represented by the office and professional employees international union opeiu under a collective bargaining agreement 
because this agreement became amendable in may  we began negotiations with union representatives in march after approximately eight weeks of discussions  an agreement could not be reached on several key areas  most notably compensation levels 
both the union representatives and we agreed to seek assistance from the national mediation board  or nmb  in appointing an independent mediator to assist with the negotiations 
a mediator was assigned by the nmb and sessions have continued to date with some progress being made 
in the future  all negotiations will be at the behest of the nmb mediator 
if the mediator and the nmb should determine that no further progress is being made toward resolution  then the nmb can seek a number of alternatives which include declare a day cooling off period 
negotiations may continue during the cooling off period 
if the dispute remains unresolved after the cooling off period  then both parties would be released from negotiations and could seek self help 
when self help is available the pilots could then engage in a work action that could take a variety of forms including a work stoppage or  the nmb can continue negotiations for extended periods of time in some instances for several years until one or both of the parties change their demands and reach an agreement 
we have contingency plans in place to respond to these scenarios and believe we will be able to continue operations with limited or no disruption in services 
however  no assurances can be given that these plans will be effective 
we cannot reasonably estimate the financial impact of a work stoppage should one occur  on our results of operations 
based on our latest proposals made to the union  base salary expense would increase by approximately annually 
given that the pilot group represents only of our north american workforce  we do not believe that this level of adjustment or the results of our negotiations will place us at a competitive financial or operational disadvantage 
demand for our helicopter services in the north sea in support of oil and gas production excluding search and rescue and norway has declined in the current fiscal year as evidenced by a decrease in flight hours for the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  we are not aware of any changes in market conditions that would reverse this downward trend 
therefore  the demand for our helicopter services in the north sea in support of oil and gas production may continue to decline in forthcoming years 
in october  we announced that we had begun a restructuring of our north sea operations 
the restructuring is designed to reduce costs and promote operational and managerial efficiencies to enable us to remain competitive in the north sea offshore helicopter market 
as part of the restructuring program  we will reduce staffing levels by approximately positions  or  of our united kingdom workforce over a nine month period 
we will incur approximately million million in severance and other restructuring costs of which million million has been accrued at march   million million is expected to be expensed in fiscal the reductions will generate approximately million million in savings during fiscal  on an annualized basis  primarily from decreased salary costs 
also as part of the restructuring  in january  we amended our only defined benefit pension plan covering certain united kingdom and other overseas employees 
the amendment  which is effective february   essentially removes the defined benefit feature for a participant s future services and replaces it with a defined contribution arrangement 
under the new defined contribution feature  we will contribute of a participant s non variable salary to a defined contribution section of the plans 
the participant will be required to contribute a minimum of of non variable salary 
participants were also given the option to transfer out of the plans 
the net impact on our statement of income as a result of these changes was a reduction in pension expense of approximately million million for our fourth quarter of fiscal on an annual basis  we estimate that the net impact on our statement of income will be a reduction of approximately million million in pension expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  the above change to the plans constitutes a curtailment of benefits and accordingly  all previously deferred service gains or losses are immediately recognized in the statement of income 
at the date of the amendment we had a deferred prior service gain of million million  or per diluted share  related to prior plan amendments 
this amount was recorded as a gain in fiscal in november  our owned mexican affiliate was unsuccessful in renewing a contract for seven aircraft contracted to pemex that it leases from us 
the current contract with pemex expires september  we are optimistic that  given the long and constructive history between pemex and our affiliate and the expanding demand for helicopter services by pemex and other customers in mexico  our affiliate will continue to operate most of the aircraft in the mexican offshore market 
alternatively  we believe these aircraft can be redeployed to other international markets in a reasonable time period 
in conjunction with our previously announced fleet and facilities renewal and refurbishment program  we changed the residual value estimate of certain aircraft and the useful lives estimate of certain aircraft  effective july  this will more closely reflect the actual salvage values realized and useful lives experienced by us 
the effect of this change was a reduction in depreciation expense of million  million net of tax  for the fiscal year ended march  general we operate our business in two segments helicopter activities and production management services 
we conduct our helicopter activities through the following four business units north american operations  north sea operations  international operations  and technical services 
in fiscal  our north american operations  north sea operations  international operations and technical services contributed   and  respectively  of our operating revenue 
while operating revenue from our helicopter activities segment has increased over the past three fiscal years  we expect that the percentage of our overall revenue derived from our international operations will continue to increase as the major oil and gas companies continue to focus their operations in these regions 
our production management services segment contributed the remaining of our operating revenue in fiscal operating revenue from this segment in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to the addition of a contract with a major customer 
our operating revenue depends on the demand for our services and the pricing terms of our contracts 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
demand for our services depends on the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
we believe that our customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
we believe our production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly  provide a more stable activity base for our flight operations 
we estimate that a majority of our operating revenue from helicopter activities is related to the production activities of the oil and gas companies 
we generate additional revenue  which we refer to as corporate revenue  from intercompany leases of aircraft within our helicopter activities segment 
this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 
our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
our rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are charged to the customer 
our helicopter contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
in our north american operations  we typically enter into short term contracts for months or less 
in our north sea operations  contracts are longer term  generally between two and five years 
in our international operations  contract length generally ranges from three to five years 
at the expiration of a contract  our customers typically negotiate renewal terms with us for the next contract period 
sometimes customers solicit new bids at the expiration of a contract 
contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors  including price  quality of service  equipment and record of safety 
an incumbent operator has a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on its relationship with the customer  its knowledge of the site characteristics and its understanding of the cost structure for the operations 
maintenance and repair expenses  training costs  employee wages and insurance premiums represent a significant portion of our overall expenses 
our production management costs also include contracted transportation services 
we expense maintenance and repair costs  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as the costs are incurred 
certain major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  are maintained by third party vendors under contractual arrangements 
the maintenance costs related to these contractual arrangements are recorded ratably as the components are used to generate flight revenue 
as a result  our earnings in any given period are directly impacted by the amount of our maintenance and repair expenses for that period 
in addition to our variable operating expenses  we incur fixed charges for depreciation of our property and equipment 
for accounting purposes  we depreciate our helicopters on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to an estimated residual value of to of their original cost 
we generally estimate the life of a helicopter to be seven  or years depending on its size and condition 
we estimate the residual value of our helicopters based on the type of the aircraft 
we only own of the common stock of bristow  but we own of bristow s subordinated debt 
in addition  we have a put call agreement with the other two stockholders of bristow which grants us the right to buy all of their shares of bristow common stock and grants to each of them the right to require us to buy their shares 
the per share price in any such sale would be equal to its par value plus a factor representing a guaranteed return on investment 
in march  we prepaid a portion of the put call option price representing the amount of guaranteed return since inception  amounting to million 
the payment was charged against minority interest on our balance sheet where this obligation had been accrued 
in consideration of this  the other shareholders of bristow agreed to reduce the guaranteed return factor used in calculating the put call option price  effective april   from per annum to libor plus 
in may  we acquired eight million shares of deferred stock  essentially a subordinated class of stock with no voting rights  from bristow for per share million in total 
bristow used these proceeds to redeem million of its ordinary share capital at par value on a pro rata basis from all of its outstanding shareholders  including ourselves 
the result of these changes will be to reduce the cost of the guaranteed return to the other shareholders  which we record as minority interest expense  by approximately million on an annual basis 
under uk law  to maintain bristow s operating license  we would be required to find a qualified european owner to acquire any of the bristow shares that we have the right or obligation to acquire under the agreement 
the only restriction under the put call agreement limiting our ability to exercise the put call option is a requirement to consult with the caa regarding the suitability of the new holder of the bristow shares 
the put call agreement does not contain any provisions should the caa not approve the new holder of the bristow shares 
however  we would work diligently to find a european owner suitable to the caa 
as a result of our ownership and contractual arrangements  we consolidate the results of bristow and its subsidiaries 
for additional information about bristow  see note a and note k in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
as a result of local laws limiting foreign ownership of aviation companies  we conduct helicopter activities in many foreign countries through interests in unconsolidated affiliates 
in some cases  we realize revenue from these foreign operations by leasing aircraft and providing services and technical support to those entities 
we also receive dividend income from the earnings of some of these entities 
we report lease revenue as operating revenue and dividend income as part of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  as the results of these foreign operations are not included in our revenue or operating income 
for additional information about these unconsolidated affiliates  see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
income taxes 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
revenue recognition 
revenue from charters of helicopters is recognized as performed based on contractual charter rates 
the helicopter charters are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
the charges under these charter contracts are generally based on either a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
additionally  we also provide services to customers on a basis we refer to as ad hoc  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on either an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee  plus additional fees for each hour flown 
our rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are charged to the customer 
revenue from production management services is recognized as these services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make adequate provisions for doubtful accounts based on historical experience  our customers financial strength and other information 
if our evaluation of our customers creditworthiness changes or is incorrect  we may have to adjust the allowance for our receivables 
inventory reserve 
we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine the adequacy of the valuation reserve 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly different from the realizable value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
insurance 
we are self insured for our group medical insurance program and must make estimates to record the expenses related to this program 
we also have deductibles on our workers compensation program and estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance programs is significantly different from our estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  then we may have to record credits to income when we identify the excess return premiums 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating information for our two segments  helicopter activities and production management services  and for the four business units comprising our helicopter activities segment 
the table also presents certain operating information about our corporate activities which primarily relate to intercompany leasing of aircraft and are eliminated in consolidation 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year information to conform to the current presentation of technical services as a separate business unit within the helicopter activities segment

our fiscal consolidated operating expenses increased to million  or  from million in fiscal this increase in operating expenses was due primarily to million in restructuring charges related to our north sea operations 
in connection with this restructuring  we amended our defined benefit pension plan which resulted in the recognition of a non cash curtailment gain of million in fiscal as a result  operating income for fiscal increased to million as compared to million for fiscal our fiscal net income was million  representing a increase from fiscal this increase primarily resulted from the curtailment gain discussed above offset by the restructuring charges related to our north sea operations  debt restructuring charges and higher foreign currency transaction losses 
set forth below is a discussion of the results of our segments and business units 
helicopter activities operating revenue from helicopter activities increased to million  or  during fiscal  with operating expenses increasing slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the portion of the curtailment gain allocated to helicopter activities of million led to an operating margin of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal helicopter activities results are further explained below by business unit 
north american operations 
operating revenue from our north american operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from the prior fiscal year while flight activity remained constant 
the increase in operating revenue with static flight activity is due primarily to the rate increase in the gulf of mexico that went into effect march and was phased in throughout fiscal operating expenses from our north american operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal excluding the effect of the change in salvage value and useful lives on certain aircraft types on depreciation expense  operating expenses for fiscal would have been million 
the result of our higher revenue and lower operating expenses was an increase in our operating margin in our north american operations to for fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
north sea operations 
operating revenue from our north sea operations decreased in fiscal to million  or  from fiscal revenue of million 
excluding foreign exchange effects and revenue related to the assets in italy disposed of in november  fiscal revenue from these operations decreased from fiscal revenue 
this decrease relates to reduced activity as reflected by the reduction in flight hours of between fiscal and fiscal operating expenses from our north sea operations  excluding foreign exchange effects and costs related to the assets in italy disposed of in november  decreased by between fiscal and fiscal the decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of lower maintenance and repair expense offset by approximately million in restructuring costs 
the operating margin in our north sea operations decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to the reduction in revenue 
international operations 
operating revenue from international operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
in brazil  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal increased by and  respectively  from fiscal the increase in flight activity and operating revenue was primarily due to three additional aircraft sent to the area during the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to increased drilling activity 
in mexico  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year levels by and  respectively 
the increase in flight activity and operating revenue were primarily due to the addition of two aircraft in the second quarter of fiscal operating revenue was positively impacted by the addition of the two aircraft and a favorable change in the mix of aircraft 
however  during july  six older aircraft which we directly leased into mexico were replaced with six newer aircraft owned by an unconsolidated affiliate 
accordingly  the revenue from these aircraft is no longer consolidated in our results 
instead  we record our equity in the net results of the unconsolidated affiliate in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  which for fiscal was million 
in nigeria  customer flight hours and operating revenue increased for fiscal by and  respectively over fiscal this increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a west african operating company in july  when we began to provide services to a major oil company under a five year contract 
excluding the activity and revenue related to this contract  customer flight hours and operating revenue decreased by and  respectively over fiscal this results from the decrease in flight activity with one customer that furnishes its own aircraft not reflected in hours 
operating margins were virtually unchanged 
operating expenses for our international operations increased in fiscal to million  or from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of higher salary costs  maintenance costs and lease fees due to increased operations in our international areas 
the operating margin in our international operations decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal technical services 
operating revenue for technical services decreased during fiscal to million  or  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses for technical services decreased slightly in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal operating margin for technical services for fiscal decreased to from in the prior year 
production management services operating revenue from our production management services segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of a contract with a major customer 
operating expenses in this segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher transportation charges 
our operating margin decreased to from in fiscal general and administrative costs consolidated general and administrative costs increased by million in fiscal primarily due to restructuring charges for our north sea operations of million 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates decreased in fiscal by million primarily due to a decrease in dividends received from investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt partially offset by higher earnings from equity method investees 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased in fiscal by million primarily due to the debt refinancing transaction that took place in june and july see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this interest was offset by million of interest capitalized in fiscal related to progress payments for our fleet and facilities renewal and refurbishment program and million of interest income from the investment of the proceeds of the debt refinancing for approximately one month 
loss on extinguishment of debt a loss on extinguishment of debt of million was recognized in fiscal related to the redemption on july  of our convertible subordinated notes and our senior notes 
approximately million of the loss pertains to the payment of redemption premiums and million pertains to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the convertible subordinated notes and senior notes 
other income expense other expense  net  for fiscal was million compared to other expense  net  of million in fiscal and primarily represents foreign currency transaction losses 
these losses arise from the consolidation of our united kingdom operations  whose functional currency is the british pound sterling  yet contracts for a portion of its revenue and expense in us dollars and other currencies for operations outside of the north sea 
the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound since march  is the primary reason for these losses 
the average british pound to us dollar exchange rate for the fiscal year ended march  was one british pound compared to one british pound for the fiscal year ended march  fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated results during fiscal  our operating revenue increased to million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in operating revenue was primarily a result of increased oil and gas activity in our international operations and rate increases on customer contracts in our north sea operations 
our fiscal consolidated operating expenses increased to million  or  from million in fiscal this increase in operating expenses was due primarily to higher labor and insurance costs and had the effect of lowering our operating margin to from in the prior fiscal year 
as a result  operating income for fiscal decreased to million as compared to million for fiscal our fiscal net income was million  representing a decrease from fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from our reduced operating income  which was partially offset by a million increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt 
set forth below is a discussion of the results of our segments and business units 
helicopter activities operating revenue from helicopter activities increased to million  or  during fiscal  with operating expenses increasing by to million 
this led to an operating margin of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal helicopter activities results are further explained below by business unit 
north american operations 
operating revenue from our north american operations decreased in fiscal to million  or  from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
operating revenue declined less rapidly than flight hours due primarily to the full fiscal year effect of the rate increase that was phased in beginning in june flight hours and operating revenue generated from larger  crew change aircraft in the gulf of mexico decreased and  respectively  from the prior year due to the decrease in drilling activity in the gulf of mexico during fiscal by contrast  flight hours and operating revenue from smaller  production related aircraft decreased and  respectively 
in addition flight hours and revenue from our north american operations declined due to unusually poor weather conditions in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter and to the termination by a large customer of its helicopter contract 
during fiscal  this customer had aircraft on full time monthly contract  including two crew change aircraft and eight smaller aircraft and accounted for approximately million of revenue for our north american operations 
in fiscal  through the termination of its contract  this customer accounted for approximately million in revenue for our north american operations 
monthly contracts with other customers were added during fiscal partially mitigating the impact of this lost work 
our operating margin in our north american operations of for fiscal decreased from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in operating margin was primarily a result of lower revenue as discussed above and wage increases for pilots  mechanics and other operational employees in response to increases in the market wages for these employee groups 
insurance costs also increased substantially 
higher depreciation costs as a result of aircraft purchased in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the decline in the operating margin 
north sea operations 
operating revenue from our north sea operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from fiscal revenue of million 
excluding foreign exchange effects  fiscal revenue from these operations increased from fiscal revenue 
the increase in operating revenue primarily resulted from rate increases on customer contracts both at mid term and upon renewal  and a favorable change in the mix of aircraft operated in fiscal flight hours for fiscal decreased by 
on july   one of our s helicopters  while ferrying passengers for a customer  crashed in the southern sector of the north sea 
as a result of the accident  the customer immediately grounded the six s helicopters it had under contract with us 
this grounding was lifted by the customer for two aircraft on august  and in early september for the remaining four aircraft 
we covered the customer s requirements by using a different aircraft type 
accordingly  flight hours were impacted  but not significantly  by the accident 
operating expenses from our north sea operations increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher employee wages and an increase in insurance costs 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in uninsured costs as a result of the north sea accident 
these costs primarily related to the retiring of main rotor blades that had a similar history to the one that was involved in the accident 
the operating margin in our north sea operations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal during november  we sold assets related to our activities in italy 
we recognized a pre tax loss on the disposal of these assets during fiscal of million  which is recorded in the gain on disposal of assets in our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
these assets generated approximately million of operating revenue for our north sea operations for fiscal and million for fiscal the loss represents the excess of book value over sales proceeds  plus the accrual of certain obligations totaling million which have been reflected in our march  consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we expect to consummate the sale of three additional aircraft based in italy 
these aircraft are currently leased by us from a third party and subleased to the buyer 
the sales of the aircraft are contingent upon our exercising purchase options under the leases and the closing of the sale to the buyer 
gains resulting from these aircraft sales are expected to be approximately million 
international operations 
operating revenue from international operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
these increases were primarily attributable to the expansion of our operations in nigeria  through the acquisition of additional aircraft in july  and an increased level of oil and gas activity in mexico and trinidad which resulted in increased demand for our services 
in mexico  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year levels by and  respectively 
the increase in flight activity and operating revenue were primarily due to additional work that we performed for a major customer 
three aircraft were transferred to mexico in the first half of calendar as a result of this demand 
the operating revenue generated from these three aircraft accounted for approximately of the increase in revenue in mexico for fiscal in nigeria  operating revenue was up by and flight activity increased for fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
on july   we purchased a controlling interest in a west africa helicopter operating company  ten single engine helicopters and three fixed wing aircraft for million 
the acquisition was financed with million of our existing cash and borrowings of million under our us credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition  we began to provide services to a major oil company under a five year contract 
excluding the flight activity and revenue relating to this contract  flight activity and revenue in nigeria decreased for the current fiscal year by and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
the disproportionate decrease in flight activity and operating revenue is primarily due to a change in the structure of one contract whereby the customer now provides its own aircraft and we provide the crew  maintenance and technical support needed to operate the aircraft 
additionally  the completion of a contract and a decrease in ad hoc work during the current fiscal year had a negative impact on flight activity and revenue 
in trinidad  operating revenue and flight activity for fiscal increased by and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase in flight activity was primarily due to a short term contract in fiscal and increased drilling activity 
operating revenue for fiscal was also favorably impacted by the full fiscal year effect of a rate increase that became effective october  operating expenses for our international operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of higher salary costs  maintenance costs and lease fees due to increased operations in our international areas 
the operating margin in our international operations decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal technical services 
operating revenue for technical services increased during fiscal to million  or  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of the expansion of these operations in december when we acquired an engine repair and overhaul facility that enabled us to provide these services to third parties 
operating expenses for technical services increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was due largely to the expansion of our operations discussed above  salary increases and additional material cost associated with an increase in projects 
operating margin for technical services for fiscal increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
production management services operating revenue from our production management services segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of a contract with a major customer in january operating expenses in this segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher transportation charges offset by a reduction in goodwill amortization expense of million due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on april  our operating margin improved to from in fiscal general and administrative costs consolidated general and administrative costs increased by million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in professional fees and higher salary expenses 
professional fees in fiscal included legal fees incurred in connection with our listing on the new york stock exchange and new corporate governance legislation  and fees for various consulting services 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased in fiscal by million primarily due to an increase in dividends received from investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the increase was primarily due to dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt 
other income expense other expense  net  for fiscal was million compared to other income  net  of million in fiscal the expense in fiscal was primarily the result of foreign currency exchange losses 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our primary source of funds to meet working capital needs  service debt and fund capital expenditures was cash from operations and the debt refinancing completed in july we believe that our future cash flow from operations  available lines of credit and other available financing will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs in the foreseeable future 
operating activities cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million as of march   and  respectively 
working capital as of march   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in fiscal was due primarily to the classification in fiscal of the million outstanding principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due in december in current maturities of long term debt

us credit facility 
as of march   we had a million unsecured working capital line of credit with a us bank that expires on august  the line of credit is subject to a sublimit of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to one month libor plus a spread ranging from to 
the rate of the spread depends on certain ratios under the credit facility 
borrowings under this credit facility are unsecured and are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
we had no amounts drawn under this facility as of march   but did have million of letters of credit utilized which reduced availability under the line 
as of march   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under this credit facility 
as of march   we had million drawn under our us credit facility and we were in compliance with all covenants under this credit facility 
uk credit facility

as of march   bristow had outstanding million of letters of credit under this facility  however  no funds were drawn under this credit facility 
as of march   bristow was in compliance with all of the covenants under this credit facility 
we are in the process of renewing the line of credit and expect it to be finalized before june  convertible subordinated notes 
in december  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due during  we repurchased million in principal amount of the notes in the open market 
the notes were convertible at any time into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  or approximately shares per  principal amount  and were redeemable at our option 
in july  we redeemed all the outstanding notes  million  as discussed in note b to our financial statements 
senior notes

the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
limited recourse term loan 
our balance sheet reflects a term loan of approximately million as of march  the loan is secured by two aircraft that we operate under an operating lease and we have provided a guarantee of up to million of the original cost of the aircraft 
the guarantee represents our maximum amount of credit exposure 
the rate of interest payable under the loan is  requires quarterly payments of million and has a balloon payment of million due in short term advance from customer 
this million advance from a customer is reimbursement for value added taxes paid by us  the ultimate obligation for which is currently under dispute between ourselves and the customer and the tax authorities 
the advance is non interest bearing and will be repaid as taxes are refunded to us by the applicable governmental agency 
uk taxes 
during january  we reached a settlement with the united kingdom inland revenue regarding the tax treatment for certain aircraft maintenance expenditures by our primary united kingdom operating company 
these expenditures are contractual cash payments made to certain repair and maintenance service providers in advance of the actual repair requirement 
we have historically deducted these expenditures for tax purposes as the payments were made  but will now treat these expenditures as prepayments for united kingdom income tax purposes to be deducted when the repair or maintenance service actually occurs 
this change in treatment was made effective april   and has resulted in a cash payment for taxes and interest of million million in the last quarter of fiscal  with a further payment due during the first quarter of fiscal of million million 
the payment of these taxes will not affect total tax expense on our income statement but will instead be treated as a deferred tax asset to be deducted in the future when the repair and maintenance services are provided 
pension plan 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow pension plan 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
in addition to the recognition of the minimum pension liability  the united kingdom rules governing pension plan funding require us to make additional cash contributions to the plan 
in february  we agreed to a schedule of contributions for our defined benefit pension plan in order to comply with the minimum funding rules of the united kingdom 
those rules require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by united kingdom legislation within three years and funded within ten years 
in recognition of participants concerns regarding the under funded position of the plan as well as other changes we are making to the plan as more fully described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  on february   we contributed million million to the plan to reach the funded level  and agreed to monthly contributions of million million for the next ten years to comply with the funding requirement 
the million million contribution was made from existing cash balances and does not materially impact our working capital position 
minority interest 
we prepaid million  representing a portion of the put call option price over the of the ordinary share capital of bristow that we do not own 
this payment was made with existing cash balances 
in may  we acquired eight million shares of deferred stock essentially a subordinated class of stock with no voting rights from bristow for per share million in total 
bristow used the proceeds to redeem million of its ordinary share capital at par value from all of its outstanding shareholders  including ourselves 
the result of these changes will be to reduce the cost of the guaranteed return to the other shareholders  which we record as minority interest expense  by million on an annual basis 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the company has the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of march payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt     operating leases      pension obligation     unconditional purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations   amount of commitment expiration per period total less than year years years over years in thousands other commercial commitments debt guarantee   letters of credit    total commercial commitments     we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs and million of the debt of rlr  both unconsolidated affiliates 
income taxes our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the variance between the federal statutory rate and the effective rate for these periods is due primarily to non taxable foreign source income available to reduce us taxable income 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
currency fluctuations through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate risk exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
generally  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our operating revenue 
because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in a component of stockholders investment and foreign currency transaction gains or losses are credited or charged to income and reflected in other income expense 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
the british pound sterling is the currency in which most of bristow s revenue and expenses are paid 
approximately of our operating revenue for fiscal was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  we receive other revenue that is not in us dollars or british pound sterling  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
we can reduce or eliminate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we also have expenses that are payable in the same foreign currency as our revenue 
our principal exposure is to changes in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
during fiscal  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
during fiscal  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us for the fiscal year  with an average of one british pound us 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us seasonality helicopter activities are seasonal in nature  as our flight activities are influenced by the length of daylight hours and weather conditions 
the worst of these conditions typically occur during the winter months when our ability to safely fly and our customers ability to safely conduct their operations is inhibited 
accordingly  our operating revenue is generally lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement requires us to record the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
we adopted sfas no 
on april  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
eliminates sfas no 
and as a result  gains and losses from extinguishments of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
also updates and amends existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we implemented sfas no 
on april   and determined that it had no impact on prior year financial statements 
on july   we redeemed all of the then outstanding principal amount of our senior notes due and our convertible subordinated notes due which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million comprised of unamortized debt issuance costs and a premium payment 
in accordance with sfas no 
the loss on extinguishment of debt was recognized as a component of income from continuing operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for fiscal periods after december  sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with restructurings  discontinued operations  plant closings  or other exit or disposal activities  when incurred rather than at the date a plan is committed to 
we have implemented the provisions of this statement on a prospective basis for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin expands existing accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees and requires recognition  at the inception of a guarantee  of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken in connection with issuing a guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective for our march  financial statements and the remaining provisions of fin apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  in december  the fasb published a revision to interpretation fin r to clarify certain provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
fin r requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity vie  as defined  when the company will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires consolidation of existing  non controlled affiliates if the vie is unable to finance its operations without investor support  or where the other investors do not have exposure to the significant risks and rewards of ownership 
fin r is effective by the end of the first reporting period beginning after december  the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have million of debt outstanding  none of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
we occasionally use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  we will use forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
we have historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of certain spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenue and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
most of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are denominated in british pound sterling 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
management does not believe that our limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk necessitates the extensive use of forward exchange contracts
