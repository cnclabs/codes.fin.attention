recent developments exult merger exult has been a leading provider of hr business process outsourcing 
on june   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with exult  inc and eagle merger corp  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of hewitt  and on october   after obtaining regulatory and stockholder approvals  the merger was completed 
eagle merger corp 
was merged with and into exult  and exult became the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of hewitt 
under the agreement  each share of exult common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into shares of hewitt class a common stock 
as such  the exult stockholders received  shares of hewitt class a stock in exchange for the  shares of outstanding exult common stock 
the purchase price is estimated to be approximately million  including assumed debt and acquisition related costs

see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information 

table of contents shelf registration statement on august   we filed an amended registration statement on form s a with the securities and exchange commission to facilitate possible future underwritten secondary offerings  block trades and other sales by the former owners and the former partners of bacon woodrow 
the registration statement became effective on august  through september   there were no sales of hewitt stock pursuant to this registration statement

restrictions on percent of the million class a shares held by certain exult senior executives after the closing of the merger will also be released each month from october through december approximately  shares per month 
the company is unable to estimate how many of the related shares will be sold 
fore holdings stated that liquidity opportunities after december could include a continuation of the release of transfer restrictions at the same or a different rate  a managed secondary offering  negotiated sales to institutions or a combination of these scenarios 
as previously disclosed  sales restrictions on remaining class b and class c shares and shares held by certain senior exult executives are expected to lapse on june  stock repurchase program on june   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate amount of million of hewitt s class a  class b and class c common stock  depending on market conditions and other customary factors  in light of the company s cash position and expected future cash flows 
no repurchases were made through september  rule sales in addition  during the year  an aggregate of  shares of stock have been converted from class b and class c common stock to class a common stock and sold under rule by the former owners and the former partners of bacon woodrow pursuant to a rule sale program previously approved by our board of directors 
segments of our billion of consolidated net revenues for fiscal  was generated in our outsourcing segment and was generated in our consulting segment 
outsourcing our outsourcing business is comprised of benefits  payroll and broader human resource administrative services  and beginning in fiscal  will include a wide range of human resource administrative services from the newly acquired exult business 
with the merger of exult on october   we expanded the organization s global presence and brought together existing service capabilities in payroll  workforce administration  rewards management  recruiting and staffing  performance management  learning and development  and talent management  with additional capabilities in recruiting and staffing  learning and development  global mobility  time and attendance  accounts payable  procurement expertise and vendor management 
since we first began providing outsourcing services in  we have made significant investments in technology  personnel and office space to build our capabilities and address market opportunity 
to maintain our outsourcing leadership position  we remain committed to making significant ongoing investments in technology  infrastructure  and people  in expanding our business and driving greater efficiencies 
with the investments that we have made in the benefits administration business to date  our acquisitions of exult  cyborg and ntrc  and our investments in workforce management administration  we expect to be able to continue to improve our outsourcing capabilities and attract new clients 

table of contents consulting our consulting services consist of three principal categories retirement and financial management  talent and organization consulting and health management 
in addition to these principal consulting service lines  we provide tailored communication services to enhance the success of client solutions in all of our service areas 
and  to a lesser degree  our client development group also provides consulting services 
we provide a wide array of consulting and actuarial services covering the design  implementation  communication and operation of health and welfare  compensation and retirement plans and broader human resources programs and processes 
we experience a high level of recurring work because of our clients annual needs for certain of our services  such as actuarial valuations of defined benefit plans and consultations regarding the processes of compensation review and health plan selection and negotiation 
certain of our consulting services  however  support more discretionary or event driven client activities  including the re engineering of a client s human resources policies  corporate restructuring and change eg mergers and acquisitions  and programs and projects designed to improve human resources effectiveness 
as we have seen in our business and industry  the demand for these services can be affected by general economic conditions  the financial position of our clients and the particular strategic activities they may be considering  and  therefore  is variable from period to period and more difficult for us to predict 
following the announcement of investigations by several states into the practices of insurance companies and insurance brokers  we reviewed our business practices relating to our consulting services 
we have received contingent commissions  on an unsolicited basis  which have been less than of our consulting revenues in each of the last years 
we stopped accepting these commissions in may  consolidated financial highlights net revenues increased or to  million in and increased or to  million in the net effects of favorable foreign currency translation  principally from the strengthening of european currencies relative to the us dollar  were approximately million for the year ended september  revenues from acquisitions of approximately million for the year ended september  also contributed significantly to the increases 
after adjusting for these factors  net revenues increased million  or  for the year ended september  during  we continued to see growth in the number of outsourcing participants we serve 
outsourcing growth was on an organic ie excluding acquisitions  constant currency basis for  including growth in our workforce management business 
consulting revenues declined on an organic  constant currency basis for for the year  declines in demand for our discretionary consulting services  primarily in certain of the other consulting service areas  were offset by growth in health benefit management consulting while retirement and financial management consulting remained relatively flat 
operating income increased or to million from million in the prior year 
during  operating income as a percentage of net revenue increased to compared to in the prior year 
in and  the timing of the vesting of the initial public offering restricted stock awards had a significant impact on the comparability of results 
excluding the amortization of the non cash initial public offering stock awards of million and million for years ended september  and  respectively  operating income was million and million for these respective periods  an increase of year over year 
excluding the initial public offering stock awards  operating income as a percentage of net revenue was and for the years ended september  and  respectively 
on this adjusted basis  operating margins remained relatively flat in from increases in outsourcing segment margin  related to continued efforts to drive efficiencies in our benefits administration outsourcing business  were offset by decreases in consulting segment margin  which was the result of declines in our european region  driven by a combination of higher costs due to a previously planned office relocation and compensation costs on lower than planned revenue  which resulted from the delay of certain legislative changes in europe  as well a decline in revenue for certain discretionary communications and other consulting assignments in north america 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates conforming with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements and this annual report 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances change  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition  performance based compensation  accounts receivable and unbilled work in process and goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenues we enter into numerous service contracts through our outsourcing and consulting businesses 
outsourcing contract terms typically range from three to five years  while consulting arrangements are generally of a short term nature 
the company has contracts for multiple services primarily in the outsourcing segment 
in these contracts  standalone deliverables include core services  such as defined benefit  health welfare or defined contribution benefit plan administration  and standalone ancillary services  such as your total rewards 
these services are tracked and valued separately and recognized as revenue over the ongoing service period 
consulting services provided in connection with outsourcing engagements are accounted for at the time services are provided and are valued based on prevailing market rates 
most consulting assignments are also very short term in nature  so that the risks of recognizing revenue in the wrong period or at different values for stand alone deliverables is significantly reduced 
the company s clients typically pay for consulting services either on a time and materials or on a fixed fee basis 
on fixed fee engagements  revenues are recognized either as services are provided using the proportional performance method  which utilizes estimates of overall profitability and stages of project completion  or at the completion of a project  based on facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized during the period in which a loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract or project losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and a portion of indirect costs exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the arrangement 
estimates are monitored during the term of the arrangement and any changes to estimates are recorded in the current period and can result in either increases or decreases to income 
performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team  and total company performance 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment  is based on our quarterly and annual results as compared to our internal targets  and takes into account other factors  including industry trends and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the company  team or individual 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual future performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim periods 

table of contents client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due 
facts and circumstances may change  which would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in process 
factors mitigating this risk include our diverse client base 
for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
estimates of fair value have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired business and net assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded significant amounts of intangible assets  including goodwill 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  with reviews at least annually 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise

segment results we operate many of the administrative and support functions of our business through centralized shared service operations  an arrangement that we believe is the most economical and effective means of supporting the outsourcing and consulting segments 
these shared services include information systems  human resources  overall corporate management  finance and legal services  general office support and space management 
additionally  we utilize a client development group that markets the entire spectrum of our services 
the compensation and related expenses  other operating expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses of the administrative and marketing functions are not allocated to the business segments  rather  they are included in unallocated shared costs 
the costs of information services  human resources and the direct client delivery activities provided by the client development function are  however  allocated to the outsourcing and consulting segments on a specific identification basis or based on usage and headcount

we believe inflation has had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years

table of contents on a pro forma basis  the company s net revenues were  million compared to its actual net revenues of  million for the year ended september  the difference in the net revenues is attributable to the inclusion of a full twelve months of the bacon woodrow net revenues on a pro forma basis as compared to the inclusion of the bacon woodrow net revenues from the june   acquisition date forward in the reported historical results for on a pro forma basis  the company s net income was million compared to its actual net income of million for the year ended september  the difference is attributable to the inclusion of owner salaries  benefits  bonuses  and payroll taxes for the entire year  the inclusion of an estimated tax expense as if the company had been subject to income tax for the entire year  the exclusion of non recurring charges for owner vacation accrual  the disproportionate share compensation charge  and the million non recurring income tax expense  the inclusion of compensation expense for the entire year  reflecting the amortization of the one time grant of initial public offering awards to employees and the estimated tax benefit related to these awards  the inclusion of the bacon woodrow operations for the entire year  adjusted for non recurring items  on a pro forma basis  the exclusion of losses incurred on a foreign currency purchase option  the inclusion of amortization expense for the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the bacon woodrow business in pro forma net income  the inclusion of estimated interest expense for borrowings to fund the payment of distributions to the former partners of bacon woodrow  and the inclusion of estimated compensation expense for the assumption of annuity liabilities in connection with the bacon woodrow acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our growth and working capital requirements with internally generated funds  credit facilities and term notes

summary of cash flows year ended september  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period at september   we reclassified the auction rate municipal bonds that were included in cash and cash equivalents to investments

table of contents for the years ended september   and  cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily related to a significant increase in advanced billing arrangements in the prior year while current year advance billing levels remained steady 
additionally  the decrease was due in part to the timing of cash collection of receivables and limited deferred billing arrangements  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and deferred compensation 
the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in over was due largely to increases in collections on client receivables 
this increase was offset by the inclusion of a full year of compensation expenses related to former owners and a provision for corporate income taxes  stemming from our transition to a corporate structure on may  prior to may   the distributions to fore holdings owners were paid out of cash flows from financing activities as capital distributions  and we did not pay corporate income taxes when we operated as a limited liability company 
in  cash collections on client receivables were lower as a result of the distribution of million of client receivables to fore holdings in fiscal as part of our transition to a corporate structure  which reduced our fiscal cash flows from operating activities 
for the years ended september   and  cash used in investing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities in over was primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of short term investments and less net cash paid for acquisitions in the current year than in the prior year 
excluding purchases and sales of short term investments and cash paid for acquisitions  cash used in investing activities increased by million due to increased expenditures for property and equipment  offset by slightly lower expenditures for software development than in the prior year 
the company s property and equipment expenditures were primarily for computer and telecommunications equipment and leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures related to the relocation to new office space in the united kingdom and the expansion of operations in india 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in over was primarily due to cash paid for acquisitions see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements and increased net purchases of short term investments  offset by decreased spending on computer hardware and software development 
for the year ended september   and  cash used in financing activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities in from was primarily due to reduced spending on capital lease obligations as we have decreased our leasing in favor of purchasing equipment and due to increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options resulting from more options becoming vested 
these lower uses of cash were offset by increased payments on our long term debt as the installments on our unsecured senior term notes have begun to come due 
with respect to and  after our transition to a corporate structure in mid  capital distributions to fore holdings owners were replaced by compensation and related expenses for those owners who remained active in the business 
this change shifted the funds used to pay owner employees from financing to operating activities in mid prior to the change  the capital distributions in were offset in large part by the receipt of the initial public offering proceeds in moving into  this change in corporate structure and form of owner remuneration was one of the primary reasons cash used in financing declined significantly in offsetting the decrease in was an increase in cash used in financing activities to pay down approximately million of additional debt from internally generated funds from operations than in the prior year 
we incur significant cash outflows for upfront implementation efforts on new outsourcing services 
these costs are capitalized as deferred contract costs and amortized over the life of the respective outsourcing arrangements 
similarly  upfront implementation fees are also deferred as deferred contract revenues and amortized over the life of the respective outsourcing arrangements 
historically  for most arrangements  we received upfront implementation fees for those efforts  however  implementation fees may also be received over the ongoing services period 
we have seen a shift to more of our implementation fees being recovered over the ongoing services period 
if this shift were to continue  this would reduce our operating cash flows when beginning to implement large new outsourcing agreements than we ve experienced in the past
