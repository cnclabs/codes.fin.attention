the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect tumbleweed s plans  estimates and beliefs 
tumbleweed s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a leading provider of secure internet messaging software products for enterprises and government 
our solutions are used by companies when email  file transfer or web communications are mission critical 
by making internet communications secure  reliable and automated  our products help customers significantly reduce their cost of doing business 
overview of our operating results during showed improvement relative to in revenue  deferred revenue  expenses  net loss  and cash flow 
our growth in both revenue and deferred revenue was driven by a number of factors including increased customer adoption of our email firewall products including the successful introduction of our dynamic anti spam service  revenues from the secure file transfer and identity validation products we acquired in the valicert  inc valicert acquisition  and growth in our targeted customer sectors in the financial services  health care  and government industries 
our reduction in expenses was attributable to our continuing focus on generating cost efficiencies including our development centers in bulgaria and india which have allowed us to augment our research and development and services offerings at a relatively lower cost structure 
our net loss was reduced due to our growth in revenues and reduction in expenses 
finally  our net cash used decreased due to the improvement in our overall results and increased proceeds from stock option exercises under our stock option plans 
we had positive cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents key performance indicators our key performance indicators are bookings and sales pipeline 
we measure bookings as the dollar value of contractual agreements entered into with customers in the period that result in either revenue in the period  deferred revenue at the end of the period  or future installments to be billed and received from the customer that are not due and payable at the end of the period or for which the software has not yet been shipped to the customer at the end of the period 
in addition to measuring the level of bookings in total in each period  we track bookings for each of our software solutions  bookings by customer industry  bookings by geographical region  and bookings by distribution channel 
generally  an increase in our bookings will result in an increase in our revenues 
we measure sales pipeline as the size of the forecasted dollar value of the sales opportunities we are addressing in current and future fiscal quarters 
in addition to measuring the size of our sales pipeline in total  we track the sales pipeline for each of our software solutions and the sales pipeline for each geographic region 
we also track how our individual sales opportunities advance through the sales pipeline towards a contract with a customer 
generally an increase in our sales pipeline will result in an increase in our future bookings and future revenues 
outlook we believe that our success in will depend particularly on our ability to increase customer adoption of our email firewall  secure file transfer  and identity validation products  our ability to successfully integrate the valicert acquisition  and our ability to maintain tight control over expenses and cash 
we believe that key risks include overall economic conditions and the overall level of information technology spending  economic and business conditions within our target customer sectors in the financial services  health care  and government industries  growing our sales channels in europe and japan  and competitive factors in our rapidly changing industry 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
please refer to the risks and uncertainties section for additional information

tkk ceased operations in august and formally declared bankruptcy in december during the three months ended march   tumbleweed performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of interface systems  inc interface 
the assessment was performed primarily due to changes in the economy  the overall decline in the industry growth rates  and our lower actual and projected operating results including that of the business acquired from interface 
our assessment was supported by the significant sustained decline in our stock price since the valuation date of the shares issued in the interface acquisition  which resulted in the net book value of our assets prior to the impairment charge significantly exceeding our market capitalization 
as a result of our review  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets

revenue  which consists of product revenue  service revenue and intellectual property and other revenue  results from new contracts and backlog

during  we focused our sales efforts on our email firewall and dynamic anti spam service  secure file transfer  secure email and document delivery  and identity validation products  and placed less emphasis on our other  non core product lines 
as a result  revenue from our non core product lines decreased in relative to we expect revenue from our non core product lines to continue to decrease in as we maintain our sales focus on our email firewall and dynamic anti spam service  secure file transfer  secure email and document delivery  and identity validation products 
product revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in product revenue was due to a million increase in license revenue offset by a million decrease in transaction based license revenue and a  decrease in subscription based license revenue 
license revenue increased by million primarily due to sales of the secure file transfer and identity validation products that we acquired in the valicert acquisition with no comparable revenue in transaction based license revenue and subscription based license revenue both decreased in due to our continued transition away from those selling models and towards selling perpetual licenses and associated support and maintenance contracts 
we expect transaction based license revenue and subscription based license revenue to decrease in the as a result of our continued transition away from those selling models 
service revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in service revenue was primarily due to a million increase in support and maintenance revenue due to growth in our installed customer base  an expansion of our customer base due to the valicert acquisition  and the successful customer acceptance of our dynamic anti spam service which was released during the three months ended june  and is sold on a subscription service fee basis 
this was partially offset by a  decrease in consulting revenue 
during  we transitioned our consulting services from secure messaging consulting services to enterprises that used both tumbleweed and non tumbleweed products to consulting services  that are focused on installation  implementation and data migration for only tumbleweed products 
as a result  we reduced the number of consulting projects for which we bid 
we decided to make this transition to improve consumer satisfaction through shortened deployment cycles and to improve our operating margin 
as a result  we reduced the number of revenue generating projects and revenue generating consultants throughout and intellectual property and other revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to greater revenue from patent license agreements in than in cost of revenue

research and development expenses are comprised of employee and employee related costs and other costs required for the development and quality assurance of our products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in allocated overhead charges  partially offset by a combined increase of  in consulting expenses  legal expenses  facilities expenses  and travel expenses 
consulting expenses increased due to increased outsourced development of non core products in the first half of  prior to the conversion of certain former contract engineers to employees in our research and development center in bulgaria during the three months ended september  facilities expenses increased due to costs associated with our research and development centers in bulgaria and india in  with no comparable expenses in legal expenses increased 
table of contents due to costs associated with the creation of our bulgarian research and development center subsidiary 
travel expenses increased due to increased geographical dispersion of our engineering workforce

investor relations expenses increased due to increased use of third party investor relations professionals 
sec reporting expenses increased due to an increase in sec financial reporting requirements 
nasdaq expenses increased due to an increase in the number of our common stock shares outstanding as a result of the acquisition of valicert 
we believe that the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property is important to our business and we expect to continue to incur costs related to the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property in however  we expect intellectual property related legal costs  and general and administrative expenses overall  to decrease in due to the settlement of our lawsuit and signing of a cross license agreement with ebay in the fourth quarter of amortization of intangible assets and write off of in process research and development

our current cash reserves  however  may be insufficient if we experience either lower than expected revenues or extraordinary or unexpected cash expenses  or for other reasons 
funding  if pursued  may not be available on acceptable terms or at all

sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
we adopted sfas as of january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
in contrast  under eitf issue  a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
sfas also established fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
we adopted the provisions of sfas as of january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
we are required to adopt the provisions of eitf as of january  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon ours consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in determining the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer arrangements  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of assets  and contingencies and litigation 
when making estimates  we consider our historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent areas where significant judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes license fees  subscription based license fees  transaction based license fees  and hosting arrangements  ii service revenue  which includes support and maintenance fees  consulting fees  and training fees  and iii intellectual property and other revenue which includes patent license agreement fees and the sale of distribution rights 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  our standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software on its hardware 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require the arrangement fee to be paid within days 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when cash is collected 

table of contents we allocate revenue on software transactions referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  including review of historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  aging of the balance and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging ranges  geographic and industry mix  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets  and goodwill prior to the adoption of sfas  may not be recoverable upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  and such carrying value is less than projected undiscounted cash flows attributed to the asset  we measure any impairment based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we evaluate goodwill on a quarterly basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during as of december   we had goodwill of million 
risks and uncertainties we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses  delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies engaged in new and rapidly evolving technology markets like ours 
we incurred net losses of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative net losses of million 
our success may depend in large part upon the adoption and utilization of our products and technology  as well as our ability to effectively maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with customers and strategic partners 
if we do not succeed in doing so  we may not achieve or maintain profitability on a timely basis or at all 
in particular  we intend to expend 
table of contents significant financial and management resources on product development  sales and marketing  strategic relationships  technology and operating infrastructure 
as a result  we may incur additional losses and continued negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
if we do not successfully optimize our marketing and distribution capacity  our business could be harmed 
if we do not optimize our methods of marketing and selling our products  it could significantly limit our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and rapidly changing  in part because third parties such as hackers and spammers whose timing and methods are somewhat unpredictable can have a significant impact on customer demand 
vendors in our markets use different methods of marketing and distribution in order to meet expected customer demand 
for example  our competitors in the anti spam market include multiple software only vendors  appliance only vendors  and service providers  as well as vendors that offer a combination of some or all of the foregoing 
moreover  vendors offerings range from single function point products and services to more sophisticated and scalable multi functional offerings 
in addition  pricing and other terms and conditions of sales contracts also vary considerably among our competition 
because it is difficult to predict demand in our rapidly changing markets  we may not be able to manage our marketing and sales efforts in an optimal way  which may disadvantage our business in comparison to competitors 
additional competitive factors in our industry include product performance and integration  platform coverage  worldwide sales infrastructure and global technical support 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources than we do  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base 
additionally  some of these competitors have research and development capabilities that may allow them to develop new or improved products that may compete with product lines we market and distribute 
we expect that the market for secure internet messaging software products will become more consolidated with larger companies being better positioned to compete in such an environment in the long term 
as this market continues to develop  a number of companies with greater resources than ours could attempt to increase their presence in this market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors or business partners 
our success will depend on our ability to adapt to these competing forces  to develop more effective products more rapidly and less expensively than our competitors  and to educate potential customers as to the benefits of licensing our products rather than developing their own products 
competitors could introduce products with superior features  scalability and functionality at lower prices than our products and could also bundle existing or new products with other more established products in order to compete with us 
in addition  because there are relatively low barriers to entry for the software market  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to grow and develop our indirect distribution channels and the inability to do so could adversely affect future operating results 
our failure to increase the number of our indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we must increase the number of strategic and other third party relationships with vendors of internet related systems and application software  resellers and systems integrators 
our existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
the volume of spam may not continue to grow rapidly  which may adversely affect the market for anti spam solutions 
although the volume of spam has grown rapidly during the last several years  it may not continue to do so because of recently enacted anti spam legislation  enforcement efforts under that legislation  and collaborative efforts by leaders of the email provider industry  as well as the potential development of new and successful anti spam technologies 
accordingly  the market for anti spam solutions may not continue to grow rapidly and may in fact decline  which may adversely affect our business 
contractual issues may arise during the negotiation of license agreements that may delay the anticipated closure of a transaction and our ability to recognize revenue as anticipated 
because we focus on selling enterprise wide software products to enterprises and government entities  the process of contractual negotiation is critical and may be lengthy 
additionally  several factors may require us to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including instances where we are required to deliver either unspecified additional products or specified upgrades for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
although we have a standard software license agreement that provides for revenue recognition to the extent that i delivery has taken place  ii collectibility from the customer is reasonably assured  and iii no significant future obligations or customer acceptance rights exist  customer negotiations and revisions to these terms could impact our ability to recognize revenues at the time of delivery 

table of contents many enterprise customers negotiate software licenses near the end of each quarter 
in part  this is because enterprise customers are able  or believe that they are able  to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of software license revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to end of period variances  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
our success depends on our ability to grow and develop our indirect distribution channels and the inability to do so could adversely affect future operating results 
our failure to increase the number of our indirect distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we must increase the number of strategic and other third party relationships with vendors of internet related systems and application software  resellers and systems integrators 
our existing or future channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies 
a limited number of customers account for a high percentage of our revenue  and the failure to maintain or expand these relationships could adversely affect our future revenue 
the loss of one or more of our major customers  the failure to attract new customers on a timely basis or a reduction in revenue associated with existing or proposed customers would harm our future revenue and prospects 
during and  five customers comprised approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may not be predictable and may result in significant volatility in our stock price 
our product revenue has fluctuated and our quarterly operating results will continue to fluctuate based on  among other things  the timing of the execution and termination of customer agreements in a given quarter 
in addition  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in revenue and operating results from quarter to quarter for other reasons  including  but not limited to target customers electing to adopt and implement our technology  the substantial decrease in information technology spending in general  and among our target customers in particular  customers choosing to delay their purchase commitments or purchase in smaller amounts than expected due to a general downturn in the economy  our ability to continue to license its patents  the timing of such licenses  and the costs necessary to defend its patents  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to our business  operations and infrastructure  our ability to accurately estimate and control costs  our ability to timely collect fees owed by customers  the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products and services in the secure content management  content security  secure online communications  or document delivery markets  and acquisitions that we complete or proposes 
as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons may not be accurate indicators of future performance 
we may not be able to accurately forecast our revenue or expenses 
because our staffing and operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels  and because a high percentage of our costs are fixed  small variations in the timing of the recognition of specific revenue could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  many of our customers delay purchases of our products until the end of each quarter 
if we are unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  any significant revenue shortfall would likely have an immediate negative effect on our operating results 
moreover  we believe the challenges and difficulties that we face  as outlined above with respect to financial forecasts  also apply to securities analysts that may publish estimates of our financial results 
our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors due to any of a wide variety of factors  including fluctuations in financial ratios or other metrics used to measure our performance 
if this occurs  we would expect to experience an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
we have a lengthy sales and implementation cycle  which increases the cost of completing sales and renders completion of sales less predictable 
if we are unable to license our services to new customers on a timely basis or if our existing and proposed customers and their end users suffer delays in the implementation and adoption of its services  our revenue may be limited and business and prospects may be harmed 
our customers must evaluate our technology and integrate our products and services into the products and services they provide 
in addition  our customers may need to adopt a comprehensive sales  marketing and training program in order to effectively implement some of our products 
finally  we must coordinate with our customers using our product for third party communications in order to assist end users in the adoption of our products 
for these and other reasons  the cycle associated with establishing licenses and implementing our products can be lengthy 
this cycle is also subject to a number of significant delays over which we have little or no control 
forecasts about license revenue may be inaccurate as a result of any or all of these factors  and inaccurate forecasts may cause our business  or market valuation  to suffer 

table of contents economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to maintain and increase revenue 
the revenue and profitability or loss of our business depends on the overall demand for our products  our intellectual property  and our services  particularly within the industries in which we offer specific versions of our products 
because our sales are primarily to customers in the financial services  health care  and government industries  our business depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries 
any weakening of the global economy  the information technology industry in particular  and the weakening of the business conditions within the above industries could cause a decrease in our license revenues 
a softening of demand for information technology spending caused by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a decrease in revenues and continued losses 
in addition  the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states and the united states involvement in iraq have led to a further weakening of the global economy  and have created an uncertain economic environment 
we cannot predict the impact of these events  any subsequent terrorist acts or of any related military action  on our customers or business 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect spending on information technology and on our software license revenue  as well as have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the terms of any financing we may obtain could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
in the future  we may be required or elect to seek additional financing to fund our operations 
factors such as the commercial success of our existing products and services  the timing and success of any new products and services  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the status of competitive products and services  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
in the event that we require additional cash  we may not be able to secure additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us  especially in light of the uncertainty in the current market environment  and we may not be successful in implementing or negotiating such other arrangements to improve our cash position 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced and the securities we issues might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms or at all  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential expansion  take advantage of new opportunities  develop or enhance products or services  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited 
we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions  which may involve substantial costs  may substantially dilute our existing investors  and may fail to yield anticipated benefits 
we are continuously evaluating investments in complementary technologies and businesses 
acquisitions of companies  divisions of companies  or products  including our acquisition of valicert  entail numerous risks  including potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration  diversion of management s attention  loss of key employees of acquired operations  coordinating sales and pricing efforts to effectively communicate the value and capabilities of the combined company  the difficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  expenses related to such integration  the correct assessment of the relative percentages of in process research and development expense that can be immediately written off as compared to the amount which must be amortized over the appropriate life of the asset  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers of either an acquired company or our business  the potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired business  and inability to recover strategic investments in development stage entities 

table of contents as a result of acquisitions  we may acquire significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
the testing of these intangibles under established accounting guidelines for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions 
changes in business conditions could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets 
in this regard  we wrote off substantially all of its investment in interface systems subsequent to the completion of that acquisition 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage or prevent an acquisition of us  which could depress our stock price 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit changes of control that are not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and prohibits stockholder action by written consent 
these provisions require advance notice for nomination of directors and stockholders proposals 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  this law prevents a person who becomes the owner of or more of the corporation s outstanding voting stock from engaging in specified business combinations for three years unless specified conditions are satisfied 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
this could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could effectively limit the voting power of the holders of our common stock 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of delaware law  may discourage or prevent an acquisition or disposition of our business 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be subject to claims of patent infringement  either of which could result in substantial costs to us 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and licenses  together with non disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products 
we hold certain patent rights with respect to some of our products 
our existing patents or trademarks  as well as any future patents or trademarks obtained by us  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
although we take precautionary measures to maintain our unpatented proprietary information  others may acquire equivalent information or otherwise gain access to or disclose our proprietary information  and we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights to our proprietary information 
as a result  our operating results could suffer 
third parties could assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us and the cost of responding to such assertions  regardless of their validity  could be significant 
we may increasingly be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of their products and services increasingly overlap with ours 
in addition  we may infringe upon patents that may be issued to third parties in the future 
it may be time consuming and costly to defend ourselves against any of these claims and we may not prevail 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could block our ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the united states and abroad 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain one or more licenses from or pay royalties to third parties 
we may be unable to obtain any such licenses at a reasonable cost  if at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain such license could harm our business 
the enforcement of our intellectual property rights  especially through patent infringement lawsuits we may initiate  could result in substantial litigation costs and ultimately may not result in additional revenue to us or a favorable judicial determination 
since we have aggressively pursued cases of potential infringement by third parties of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
the enforcement process is costly and requires significant management attention 
these costs generally are expensed during the period incurred  and the costs of pursuing the litigation may not be directly matched with the related licensing or settlement revenue  if any 
in addition  our enforcement of our rights may increase the risk of adverse claims  with or without merit  which could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  limit the use of our services  or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
in addition  such counter claims asserted by these third parties may be found to be valid and could result in an injunction or damages against us 
our ability to prevail in this litigation is inherently uncertain  and if we were subject to an adverse judicial determination  our ability to protect our products and to secure related licensing or settlement revenue could be lost 
failure to license necessary third party software incorporated in our products could cause delays or reductions in our sales 
we license third party software that we incorporates into our products 
these licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
some of this technology would be difficult to replace 
the loss of any such license 
table of contents could result in delays or reductions of our applications until we identify  license and integrate or develop equivalent software 
if we are required to enter into license agreements with third parties for replacement technology  we could face higher royalty payments and our products may lose certain attributes or features 
in the future  we might need to license other software to enhance our products and meet evolving customer needs 
if we are unable to do this  we could experience reduced demand for its products 
we are a defendant in two purported securities class action lawsuits that could divert management attention and resources or eventually expose us to liability 
in june  we were served with a summons and first amended complaint  captioned liu v 
credit suisse first boston  et alia  alleging the violation of federal and state securities laws  purportedly on behalf of persons who acquired our common stock other than purchasers of our initial public offering from august  to october  the case is now pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  where the court held a status conference in september at the status conference we pointed out  and plaintiffs counsel conceded  that the named plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue the action because they had not purchased any shares of any of the issuer defendants then in the case 
in october plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint  which we have opposed 
an adverse outcome could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss  as we do not consider a loss to be probable at this time 
an adverse outcome could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
in december  certain plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of valicert  alleging violations of federal securities laws 
in re valicert  inc initial public offering securities litigation  no 
cv sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  no 
mc sas 
in june  valicert accepted a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants in this case 
under the proposed settlement  the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the valicert defendants in exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all the consolidated cases  and the assignment or surrender of control to the plaintiffs of certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters 
under the guaranty  the insurers will be required to pay the amount  if any  by which billion exceeds the aggregate amount ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all of the cases 
if the plaintiffs fail to recover billion and payment is required under the guaranty  valicert would be responsible to pay its pro rata portion of the shortfall  up to the amount of the deductible retention under its insurance policy  which is  the timing and amount of payments that valicert could be required to make under the proposed settlement will depend on several factors  principally the timing and amount of any payment required by the insurers pursuant to the billion guaranty 
the proposed settlement is subject to approval of the court  which cannot be assured 
failure of the court to approve the settlement followed by an adverse outcome could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include a reserve for any potential loss  as we do not consider a loss to be probable at this time 
an adverse outcome could harm our business and operating results 
moreover  the costs in defending this lawsuit could harm future operating results 
if we lose the services of executive officers or other key employees  our ability to develop our business and secure customer relationships will suffer 
we are substantially dependent on the continued services and performance of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could significantly harm our business and prospects 
our international business exposes us to additional risks that may result in future additional costs or limit the market for product sales 
products and services provided to tumbleweed s international customers accounted for of revenues for conducting business outside of the united states subjects us to additional risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws  tariffs and other trade barriers  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  problems in collecting accounts receivable  and difficulties in authenticating customer information 
managing these risks may subject us to additional costs that may not be justified in light of the market opportunity  and the inability to comply with or manage foreign laws and related risks may preclude or limit sales in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  that began in china  hong kong  singapore and vietnam may have a negative impact on our operations by factors such as reduced sales in international channels 
we rely on public key cryptography and other security techniques that could be breached  resulting in reduced demand for our products and services 
a requirement for the continued growth of electronic commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and private key  for encoding and decoding data  and on digital certificate technology  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the strongest and most secure cryptographic protection available  and thereby may expose us or our customers to a risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our or our customers operations 
any compromise or elimination of our security could result in risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and reduce demand for our products and services 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in bulgaria  india  japan  the netherlands  switzerland  or the united kingdom denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  our investments are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   none of our cash equivalents were subject to market risk
