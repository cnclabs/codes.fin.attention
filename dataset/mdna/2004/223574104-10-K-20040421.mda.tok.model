fin  guarantees  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
compliance with this interpretation has not had a material impact 
in january  fasb issued fasb interpretation no

inflation since inflation has slowed in recent years  covista does not believe that its business has been materially affected by the relatively modest rate of price increases in the economy 
however  pressures in the industry to reduce prices  which have impacted covista in the past  are expected to continue 
also the telecommunications industry has recently experienced the failure of several businesses  some of which are covista s wholesale customer and suppliers 
these failures not only have affected covista s fy results  but also may impact future results 
environmental matters covista is not a party to any legal proceedings or the subject of any claim regarding environmental matters generally incidental to its business 
in the opinion of management  compliance with the present environmental protection laws should not have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of covista item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
the exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the marketable securities held by covista 
covista only invests in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
covista does not hold any derivatives related to its interest rate exposure 
covista also maintains long term debt at fixed rates 
due to the nature and amounts of covista s note payable  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect in covista s results of operations over the next fiscal year 
covista s exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is also immaterial to the consolidated statements as a whole
