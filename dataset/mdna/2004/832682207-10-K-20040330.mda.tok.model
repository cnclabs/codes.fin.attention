overview we provide advanced electronics manufacturing services  or ems  to electronics industry original equipment manufacturers  or oems  primarily in the industrial  enterprise computing and networking  and communications market segments 
we currently service our customers through five manufacturing and technology centers strategically located in key technology corridors in the united states  canada and the cost effective location of mexico 
our full range of value added supply chain services include product design  procurement  prototyping  advanced cable and harness interconnect  high precision enclosures  printed circuit board assembly  test  final system build  comprehensive supply chain management  packaging  global distribution and after sales support 
as the technology sector grew rapidly in the years and  we sought to take advantage of such growth and completed several acquisitions  including zenith electronics facility in chihuahua  wf wood s high precision enclosure manufacturing site in boston  massachusetts  pensar corporation  an ems company specializing in design engineering and headquartered in appleton  wisconsin and qualtron teoranta  a provider of specialized cable and harness interconnect assemblies  based in donegal  ireland with a subsidiary in haverhill  massachusetts 
when the technology sector declined  we found ourselves with significant excess capacity and incurred significant operating losses 
as a result  in fiscal year  we began an operational restructuring that is substantially complete today and involved closing six and selling one of our manufacturing facilities 
as a result of the restructuring of our business  the debt outstanding under our credit facility cannot be supported by our current business model 
accordingly  we have negotiated a restructuring of the debt under our existing credit agreement as part of an overall recapitalization of the company that is subject to stockholder approval 
the following summary briefly describes the material terms of the proposed recapitalization of the company  which consists of three main components a private placement of equity securities that closed into escrow pending stockholder approval  a new secured credit facility and a transaction with the company s current lenders to repay a portion of the company s existing debt and restructure the balance of the company s existing debt 
we refer to the proposed recapitalization in this annual report as the recapitalization transaction 
private placement of equity securities the private placement consisted of a committed private placement fully underwritten by a syndicate of canadian investment dealers comprised of orion securities inc  cibc world markets inc  gmp securities limited and rbc dominion securities inc collectively  the underwriters of  special warrants of smtc manufacturing corporation of canada each a special warrant and  collectively  the special warrants  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company smtc canada  to qualified investors at a price of cdn approximately us per special warrant  representing an aggregate amount of issue of cdn  approximately us million the offering 
the company completed the private placement of special warrants on march  the closing date 
the net proceeds from the offering are being held in escrow pending receipt of stockholder approval and  upon release from escrow  will be used for debt reduction  as part of a concurrent agreement with the company s lenders  and working capital 
the private placement includes the following terms each special warrant is exercisable into one unit consisting of one exchangeable share of smtc canada  and one half of a warrant to purchase an exchangeable share 
each whole warrant will be exercisable for one exchangeable share of smtc canada at an exercise price of cdn per share for a period of months following the closing of the offering 
subject to satisfaction of applicable legal requirements  each exchangeable share can be exchanged on a one for one basis for one share of the common stock of the company 
each exchangeable share  as nearly as practicable  is the economic equivalent of a share of our common stock  and holders of the exchangeable shares are able to exercise essentially the same voting rights with respect to the company as they would have if they had exchanged their exchangeable shares for our common stock 
the special warrants will be exerciseable for units on the earlier of i the sixth business day after the date on which a receipt has been issued by applicable canadian securities regulatory authorities for a final prospectus qualifying the distribution of the exchangeable shares and warrants issuable upon exercise of the special warrants the prospectus qualification date  and ii the first business day following the date that is months following the closing date 
if the prospectus qualification date has not occurred on or before the date that is days following the closing date or if the company has not  within days of the closing date  registered in the united states the common stock underlying the exchangeable shares issuable in connection with the offering  each special warrant shall thereafter entitle the holder to receive upon exercise  without payment of additional consideration  units  in lieu of  one unit 
new secured credit facility the proposed recapitalization transaction also includes a new  year million credit facility  subject to certain borrowing base conditions  with congress financial corporation canada for which a letter of intent has been signed 
transactions with the company s current lenders the proposed recapitalization transaction includes a transaction with the company s current lenders  for which a binding term sheet has been signed  under which the company will satisfy its debt by repaying million of debt at par  exchanging million of debt for million of the company s common stock and warrants valued on the same terms as the private placement  canceling the warrants held by the current lenders  and converting up to a limit of million  into second lien subordinated debt with maturity ranging from to years 
in the unlikely event the remaining debt exceeds this limit  the difference will be repaid at par 
certain effects of the recapitalization transaction the effect of this refinancing would be to lower the company s overall indebtedness at closing by approximately million  extend the term of the majority of the remaining indebtedness and provide additional liquidity 
the level of indebtedness under the existing lenders facility at december  was million 
currently outstanding shares will be of the outstanding shares after the recapitalization transaction and of the outstanding shares upon the exercise of the private placement warrants and the warrants that will be issued to our current lenders with such exercise generating approximately cdn million in additional proceeds for the company 
need for the recapitalization transaction the board of directors has approved the proposal for the recapitalization transaction 
we believe that the recapitalization transaction is in the best interests of the company and the stockholders due to the over leveraged capital structure of the company  the increased liquidity and working capital availability afforded by the refinancing  the high probability of default under our credit agreement absent a refinancing  the lack of a more favorable offer to the recapitalization transaction proposal following a process undertaken to identify potential purchasers of all or part of the company  and the less favorable alternative to the company and the stockholders that resulted from the negotiations with our current lenders regarding a stand alone refinancing 
we believe that the likely outcome for the company if the recapitalization transaction is not completed would be negative 
if the recapitalization transaction had not been agreed to with the company s lenders prior to the issuance of the company s financial results for fiscal year  the company believes that suppliers and customers would have reacted negatively to the going concern qualification in the company s accountants audit opinion 
further  the company would likely have been in default of other covenants under the terms of its existing credit agreement no later than the end of june absent the agreement with the current lenders on the recapitalization transaction  upon an event of default  the lenders could have decided to resort to their collateral  consisting of substantially all of the company s assets and in which event reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code could have been one of the possible consequences 
if the recapitalization transaction is not approved by the stockholders  the company will likely face a high probability of an event of default with its current lenders no later than the end of june as a result of the restructuring of the company and market conditions in the period to  we incurred significant operating losses 
as a result of the late stages of the restructuring of the company  the continued downturn in the technology sector and the over leveraged capital structure of the company  the company continued to experience losses during fiscal the losses from fiscal through resulted in our repeated non compliance with certain financial covenants contained in our credit agreement and repeated amendments to our credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with the amended financial covenants at december  continued compliance with the amended financial covenants through october   the term of the credit facility  is unlikely 
in the event of non compliance and absent the completion of the recapitalization transaction  the company s lenders have the ability to demand repayment of the outstanding amounts under the amended credit facility 
corporate history smtc corporation is the result of the july combination of the former smtc corporation  or surface mount  and htm holdings  inc  or htm 
surface mount was established in toronto  ontario in htm was established in denver  colorado in smtc was established in delaware in after the combination  we purchased zenith electronics facility in chihuahua  mexico  which expanded our cost effective manufacturing capabilities in an important geographic region 
in september  we established a manufacturing presence in the northeastern united states and expanded our value added services to include high precision enclosure capabilities by acquiring boston  massachusetts based wf wood 
in july  we acquired pensar corporation  an ems company specializing in design engineering and headquartered in appleton  wisconsin 
on july   we consummated an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and  exchangeable shares of our subsidiary smtc manufacturing corporation of canada  or smtc canada 
each exchangeable share of smtc canada is exchangeable at the option of the holder at any time into one share of our common stock  subject to compliance with applicable securities laws 
on august   we sold an additional  shares of common stock upon exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in november  we acquired qualtron teoranta  a provider of specialized cable and harness interconnect assemblies  based in donegal  ireland and with a subsidiary in haverhill  massachusetts 
in fiscal  we closed our facilities in denver  colorado and haverhill  massachusetts 
in fiscal  we closed our facility in cork  ireland 
in fiscal  we closed our facilities in donegal  ireland  austin  texas and charlotte  north carolina and sold the majority of our operations in appleton  wisconsin 
results of operations our contractual arrangements with our key customers generally provide a framework for our overall relationship with our customer 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized when goods are shipped to customers since title has passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  all customer specified test criteria have been met and the earnings process is complete 
the company also derives revenue from engineering and design services 
service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
actual production volumes are based on purchase orders for the delivery of products 
typically  these orders do not commit to firm production schedules for more than to days in advance 
to minimize inventory risk  generally we order materials and components only to the extent necessary to satisfy existing customer forecasts or purchase orders 
fluctuations in material costs typically are passed through to customers 
we may agree  upon request from our customers  to temporarily delay shipments  which causes a corresponding delay in our revenue recognition 
our fiscal year end is december the consolidated financial statements of smtc  including the consolidated financial statements of htm for periods prior to the combination  are prepared in accordance with united states gaap  which conforms in all material respects to canadian gaap  except as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements

during the second quarter of  the company informed dell of its intention to terminate its supply agreement and to end production over the third quarter of the company s decision was taken after a review of the company s return on capital requirements indicated that the customer s programs were not generating sufficient returns for the disproportionate amount of working capital utilized 
while the decision to terminate the company s supply agreement with dell lowered the company s revenue  the reduction in revenue was offset by reduced expenses and reduced working capital requirements 
in  smtc s focus on the industrial sector resulted in a substantial change to the product mix over the industrial sector represented of total sales in  compared to in the proportion of sales to both the enterprise computing and networking and the communications sectors declined to and respectively in from and respectively in during we recorded approximately million of sales of raw materials inventory to customers  which carried no margin  compared to million for the same period in revenue from ibm of million  ingenico of million and square d of million for the year ended december  was  and  respectively  of total revenue for the period

we expect to continue to increase the portion of revenue attributable to our chihuahua  mexico and markham  ontario  canada facilities  with the transfer of certain production from other facilities 
we terminated manufacturing in europe during the second quarter of gross profit gross profit increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  fiscal year gross profit includes the effect of restructuring charges of million related to an additional write down of inventory in connection with the closure of our denver facility and other inventory related charges of million resulting from the costs associated with the disengagement of dell  coupled with the effects of the continued downturn in the technology sector 
gross profit  excluding restructuring and other charges  decreased million from million  or of revenue for fiscal year  to million  or of revenue for fiscal year the decline in absolute dollar gross profit  excluding restructuring and other charges  is due to the effect of the lower revenue in  which was largely offset by cost savings due to capacity reductions that were significantly completed by the second quarter of and an improvement in customer mix as the company continues to diversify its customer base 
gross margins improved as a result of a higher concentration of sales to the industrial sector relative to both the enterprise computing and networking and the communications sectors 
margins in the industrial sector are typically higher due to a greater degree of product customization and smaller  more diversified lot sizes 
gross profit was adversely affected by increased costs to meet customers orders due to our credit related constraints 
specifically  credit constraints arose from our burdensome debt position  resulting in additional freight and material costs and labor inefficiencies that lowered our margins in the fourth quarter of the company writes down estimated obsolete or excess inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated realizable value based upon customer forecasts  shrinkage  the aging and future demand of the inventory  past experience with specific customers and the ability to sell back inventory to customers or suppliers 
if these estimates change  additional write downs may be required 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year include million related to a write down of certain assets 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year include an adjustment to previously recorded other charges of million 
excluding the charges and adjustment noted above  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million from million  or of revenue for fiscal year  to million  or of revenue for fiscal year due to the closure of our donegal  austin and charlotte facilities and to our continued focus on reducing selling  general and administrative expenses at each operating site 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of lower revenue

 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
as a result of the quarterly review undertaken at the end of the second quarter of  the company concluded that given the weakness and uncertainty in the current economic environment  it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from its operations in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
as a result  the total valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in all jurisdictions worldwide increased from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  in addition  the company expects to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until it can demonstrate a sustained level of profitability that establishes its ability to utilize the assets in the jurisdictions to which the assets relate

b write down of intangible assets during  the company recorded a write down of intangible assets of million  which includes the write down of goodwill associated with a previous acquisition of qualtron teoranta of million and the write down of intangible assets of million 
in accordance with the then current accounting policy of the company  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets  including goodwill  held and used by an entity  were reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
due to the downturn in the electronics manufacturing services industry  the significant operating loss incurred in fiscal and the restructuring and other charges recorded in  the company reviewed the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including allocated goodwill and other intangible assets 
the evaluation indicated that the estimated future net cash flows associated with the long lived assets acquired as part of the qualtron teoranta acquisition were less than their carrying value and  accordingly  a write down to estimated fair values was recorded for unamortized goodwill associated with the acquisition of qualtron teoranta and certain intangible assets

a restructuring charges the write down of inventory of million represents further costs associated with the closure of the assembly facility in denver and costs associated with the closure of the interconnect facility in donegal  ireland 
lease and other contract obligations of million represent the costs associated with exiting equipment leases and exiting facility leases in austin and donegal  ireland 
severance costs of million are associated with the closure of the interconnect facility in donegal  ireland and the resizing of various other locations 
the severance costs related to plant and operational employees  primarily at the mexico and donegal  ireland facilities 
other facility exit costs of million include other costs associated with the decommissioning and closure of the austin and donegal  ireland facilities 
asset impairment charges of million reflect the write down of certain long lived and other assets  primarily at the austin location  that became impaired as a result of the rationalization of facilities 
the asset impairment was determined based on undiscounted projected future net cash flows relating to the assets  resulting in a write down to estimated salvage values 
during  the company recorded an adjustment to lease and other contract obligation costs recorded as part of the plan of million upon negotiating a final settlement on a facility lease for amounts less than originally estimated 
the major components of the restructuring plan were completed during fiscal b other charges other charges included in cost of sales of million relate to inventory charges resulting from the disengagement with a customer  coupled with the effects of the continued downturn in the technology sector 
other charges of million included in selling  general and administrative expenses relate to the write off of certain assets 
other charges of million included in amortization expense relate to additional amortization recorded to reflect the december amendment to our credit facility 
the restructuring charges are based on certain estimates and assumptions using the best available information at the time and are subject to change 
interest expense interest expense decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to lower average debt outstanding during combined with lower interest rates 
the weighted average interest rates with respect to the debt for the years ended december  and december  were and  respectively 
income tax expense for the year ended december   an income tax recovery of million was recorded on a pre tax loss before discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting policy of million 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon consideration of these factors  management believes the recorded valuation allowance related to the loss carryforwards is appropriate 
however  in the event that actual results differ from estimates or management adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
for the year ended december  an income tax recovery of million was recorded on a pre tax loss before discontinued operations of million resulting in an effective tax recovery rate of  as losses in certain jurisdictions were not tax effected due to the uncertainty of our ability to utilize such losses 
we also were unable to deduct million of goodwill amortization and million of goodwill and intangible asset write downs

b cork in february  the main customer of our cork  ireland facility was placed into administration as part of a financial restructuring 
as a result  on march   we announced that we were closing our cork  ireland facility and that we were taking steps to place the subsidiary that operated that facility in voluntary administration 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the closure of the facility 
the following information relates to the cork discontinued operations year ended in millions december  december  revenue loss from discontinued operations in  the loss from discontinued operations includes restructuring charges of million and other charges of million 
in  the loss from discontinued operations includes the costs of closing the facility of million

during  the company recorded an accrual for costs associated with the exiting of the facility of million  consisting of lease and other contract obligations of million  severance of million and other facility exit costs of million 
during  aggregate cash payments of million were made  and the accrual at december  of million related to additional severance payments to be made 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash provided from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in the past  we have also relied on our access to the capital markets 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance mergers and acquisitions  to meet debt service requirements and to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
we anticipate our principal uses of cash in the future will be to meet debt service requirements and to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
liquidity net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
inventory turns excluding the inventory related to discontinued operations declined to nine times at the end of the fourth quarter of from times for the same period in accounts receivable days sales outstanding excluding the accounts receivable related to discontinued operations increased to days at the end of the fourth quarter of from days for the same period in despite the increase in accounts receivable days  the percentage of past due accounts receivable relative to total accounts receivable decreased to at december  from at december  during  the company made million of restructuring payments 
net cash used in financing activities for year ended december  of million consists of the repayment of long term debt of million and the repayment of capital leases of million  offset by the repayment of stockholder loans of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million resulting from proceeds of million from a disposition of discontinued operations and proceeds from the sale of capital assets of million  offset by purchases of capital assets of million 
liquidity net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
our continued focus on improving our accounts receivable and inventory levels during the year led to the reduced working capital usage 
inventory turns excluding the inventory related to discontinued operations improved to times at the end of the fourth quarter of from times for the same period in accounts receivable days sales outstanding excluding the accounts receivable related to discontinued operations improved to days at the end of the fourth quarter of from days for the same period in past due accounts receivable as a percentage of total accounts receivable remained unchanged at from to during  the company made million of restructuring payments 
net cash used in financing activities for year ended december  of million consists of the repayment of long term debt of million  the repayment of capital leases of million and the costs associated with the amendments to our credit agreement of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million due to the net purchase of capital and other assets 
capital resources as a result of restructuring actions and market conditions we have incurred losses during  and  which resulted in our repeated non compliance with financial covenants contained in our credit agreement and repeated amendments to our credit agreement to revise the financial covenants to be more consistent with our actual and forecasted revenue levels 
in connection with an amendment to our credit facility in december  the company agreed to issue warrants to the lenders to purchase common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of the grant if we did not meet certain ebitda targets 
as a result of our shortfall in achieving such ebitda targets  we have issued  or are currently obligated to issue  a total of  warrants 
if the recapitalization transaction is approved and consummated  all of the warrants issued pursuant to the december amendment will be cancelled and the debt under the current credit agreement will be restructured 
as a result of the restructuring of our business and the continuing downturn in the market  the debt outstanding under our credit facility cannot be supported by our current business model and it is no longer sufficient to continue to seek amendments to our credit agreement 
accordingly  we have negotiated a restructuring of the debt under our existing credit agreement as part of an overall recapitalization of the company that is subject to stockholder approval 
as described in greater detail under overview  in  the company proposes to effectuate a recapitalization transaction through three main components a private placement of equity securities  a new secured credit facility and a transaction with the company s current lenders to repay a portion of and restructure a portion of the company s existing debt the company completed a fully underwritten  committed private placement of  special warrants of smtc canada to qualified investors at a price of cdn approximately us per special warrant  representing an aggregate amount of issue of cdn  approximately us million  which closed on march  the net proceeds are being held in escrow pending receipt of stockholder approval and  upon release from escrow  will be used for debt reduction  as part of a concurrent agreement with the company s lenders  and working capital 
the company has entered into a letter of intent with congress financial corporation canada for a new  year million credit facility  subject to certain borrowing base conditions 
the company has entered into a binding term sheet with its current lenders under which the company will satisfy its debt by repaying million of debt at par  exchanging million of debt for million of the company s common stock and warrants valued on the same terms as the private placement  and converting up to a limit of million  into second lien subordinated debt with maturity ranging from to years 
in the unlikely event the remaining debt exceeds this limit  the difference will be repaid at par 
we expect that the effect of the refinancing will be to lower the company s overall indebtedness at closing by approximately million  extend the term of the majority of the remaining indebtedness and provide additional liquidity 
the level of indebtedness under the existing lenders facility at december  was us million 
if we complete the recapitalization transaction  our management believes that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our senior credit facility will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs at our current level of operations and organic growth through the next twelve months  although no assurance can be given in this regard  particularly with respect to amounts available under our credit facility  as discussed above 
further  there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to enable us to service our indebtedness 
our future operating performance and ability to service or refinance indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
if we do not complete the recapitalization transaction  we would likely be in default of covenants under our credit agreement no later than the end of june upon an event of default  our lenders would have the right to proceed against all of the collateral granted to them to secure our indebtedness  consisting of substantially all of our assets  and reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code could be a possible consequence 
in this circumstance  our management believes that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under our senior credit facility would not be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures and working capital needs at our current level of operations and organic growth through the next twelve months 
as at december   contractual repayments due within each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows in millions contractual obligations and thereafter total long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations included in the operating lease obligations are million  million  million and million  representing lease costs for the years to  respectively  which have been recorded as part of the restructuring charges and accrued in the consolidated financial statements at december  in the normal course of business  the company may be subject to litigation and claims from customers  suppliers and former employees 
management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts  where required 
although it is not possible to estimate the extent of potential costs  if any  management believes that ultimate resolution of such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
contingent liabilities in the form of letters of credit and letters of guarantee are provided to certain third parties 
these guarantees were entered into prior to january   and cover various payments  including customs and excise taxes and raw material purchases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following critical accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reduces the accounts receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected 
a specific allowance is recorded against customer accounts receivable that are considered to be impaired based on the company s knowledge of the financial condition of its customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  the company considers factors  including the length of time the accounts receivable have been outstanding  customer and industry concentrations  the current business environment and historical experience 
inventory valuation inventories are valued  on a first in  first out basis  at the lower of cost and replacement cost for raw materials and at the lower of cost and net realizable value for work in progress and finished goods 
inventories include an application of relevant overhead 
the company writes down estimated obsolete or excess inventory for the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value based upon customer forecasts  shrinkage  the aging and future demand of the inventory  past experience with specific customers  and the ability to sell inventory to customers or on return to suppliers 
if these assumptions change  additional write downs may be required 
restructuring and other charges in response to excess capacity caused by the slowing technology end market  the company recorded restructuring and other charges aimed at reducing its cost structure 
in connection with exit activities  the company recorded charges for inventory write downs  employee termination costs  lease and other contractual obligations  long lived asset impairment and other exit related costs 
these charges were incurred pursuant to formal plans developed by management 
the recognition of restructuring and other charges required the company to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activities 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring the recording of additional charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  the company evaluates the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provision are for their intended purposed in accordance with the developed exit plans 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
under statement assets must be classified as either held for use or available for sale 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset that is held and used exceeds the projected undiscounted future net cash flows expected from its use and disposal  and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is measured by discounted cash flows when quoted market prices are not available 
for assets available for sale  an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value less costs to sell 
prior to january   recoverability of assets to be held and used was measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset groupings to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized was measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  the company has presented the closure of its cork facility in and sale of its appleton facility in as discontinued operations 
income tax valuation allowance in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  change of control limitations  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years in the jurisdictions to which the deferred tax assets relate 
based upon consideration of these factors  management believes the recorded valuation allowance related to all of its loss carryforwards is appropriate 
forward looking statements a number of the matters and subject areas discussed in this form k are forward looking in nature 
the discussion of such matters and subject areas is qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally  these expectations may differ materially from smtc s actual future experience involving any one or more of such matters and subject areas 
smtc cautions readers that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k regarding smtc s financial position and business strategy may constitute forward looking statements 
all of these forward looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions made by smtc s management  which although believed to be reasonable  are inherently uncertain 
therefore  undue reliance should not be placed on such estimates and statements 
no assurance can be given that any of such estimates or statements will be realized  and it is likely that actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include the failure of stockholders to approve our pending recapitalization transactions  increased competition  increased costs  the inability to implement our business plan and maintain covenant compliance under our credit agreement  the loss or retirement of key members of management  increases in smtc s cost of borrowings or lack of availability of additional debt or equity capital on terms considered reasonable by management  adverse state  federal or foreign legislation or regulation or adverse determinations by regulators  changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which smtc may compete and fluctuations in demand in the electronics industry  the inability to manage inventory levels efficiently in light of changes in market conditions  and the inability to sustain historical margins as the industry develops 
smtc has attempted to identify certain of the factors that it currently believes may cause actual future experiences to differ from smtc s current expectations regarding the relevant matter or subject area 
in addition to the items specifically discussed in the foregoing  smtc s business and results of operations are subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the heading factors that may affect future results below 
the operations and results of smtc s business may also be subject to the effect of other risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  items described from time to time in smtc s reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
factors that may affect future results risks related to the recapitalization transaction if we fail to complete the recapitalization transaction  we would likely have an event of default under the terms of our existing credit agreement and would not likely be able to negotiate a transaction on equal or more favorable terms 
if the recapitalization transaction is not approved at the stockholders meeting  we expect that we would not be able to negotiate a transaction on terms as favorable as the recapitalization transaction 
we also expect that we would likely be in default under our existing credit agreement no later than june upon a default  the lenders under our current credit facility could resort to their collateral consisting of substantially all of our assets and reorganization proceedings under the bankruptcy code and or the companies creditors arrangement act could be one of the possible consequences 
if we complete the recapitalization transaction  current stockholders will be subject to significant dilution 
currently outstanding shares will be of the outstanding shares after the recapitalization transaction and of the outstanding shares upon the exercise of the warrants sold pursuant to the private placement and the debt exchange that are part of the recapitalization transaction with such exercise generating approximately cdn million in additional proceeds for the company 
the company is currently exposed to foreign currency exchange risk on the proceeds of the recapitalization in escrow 
as part of the recapitalization transaction  we have agreed to repay million in cash to our existing lenders 
this amount will be generated by borrowings under our new working capital facility and from the proceeds of our equity offering  which  net of underwriting expenses  total cdn million and are held in escrow 
we will be required to convert the escrowed proceeds  upon stockholder approval  to satisfy the obligations to our existing lenders 
in the event the canadian dollar weakens relative to the us dollar  it will have an adverse effect on our ability to purchase us dollars in the amount of approximately us  for every 
change in the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
the company will monitor the exchange rate and the extent it deems necessary  it will hedge all or a portion of the cdn million  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its hedging strategy 
we will not be entitled to a refund of the underwriters fees if the recapitalization transaction is not completed 
we paid of the gross proceeds on the sale of special warrants  or approximately  as cash commission to the underwriters at the closing into escrow 
in the event our stockholders do not approve the recapitalization transaction  all of the escrowed funds will be returned to the purchasers of the special warrants  and we will not be entitled to a refund of the commission and expenses paid to the underwriters 
we may have to issue to the purchasers of the special warrants  units exchangeable for exchangeable shares and exchangeable share purchase warrants of smtc canada on the same terms as the private placement 
in the event that we do not obtain our stockholders approval for the recapitalization transaction  then  subject to nasdaq approval  the purchasers of special warrants will be allowed  for a period of five business days following the date on which our stockholders declined to approve the offering of the special warrants  to subscribe  on a pro rated basis  for units representing i an aggregate number of underlying exchangeable shares that does not exceed of all such issued and outstanding exchangeable shares and ii an aggregate number of underlying shares of our common stock that  together with the underlying share of common stock issuable on exchange of the securities described in i  does not exceed of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the company 
the purchasers will be able to subscribe the allowable subscription for these units on the same terms as the offering of the special warrants 
we may have to pay the purchasers of the special warrants an additional amount if we enter into an alternative business transaction 
if we fail to obtain stockholder approval for the recapitalization transaction and then  on or prior to february   we complete an equity issuance for greater than of the number of shares of our common stock and exchangeable shares outstanding as of february  or a transaction that results in a change of control of the company  we will be required to pay to each purchaser of special warrants with respect to the number of exchangeable shares included in special warrants that were held in escrow for the benefit of such purchaser or its assignees at the time the stockholders declined to approve the recapitalization transaction minus the number of exchangeable shares purchased by such purchaser or its assignees pursuant to the allowable subscription an amount equal to one half of the difference between the average market price of the exchangeable shares at the close of business for the period that is ten trading days immediately preceding the date of the stockholders meeting called to approve the recapitalization transaction and the subscription price of the units for which the special warrants are exercisable  in part 
this fee would likely have the effect of making it more difficult for us to find another party interested in a transaction and would further reduce the likelihood that we would be able to negotiate a transaction on equal or more favorable terms 
risks related to our business and industry we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of recent unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending  our sales have declined in from in particular  sales to oems in the telecommunications and enterprise computing and networking industries worldwide were impacted during if economic conditions worsen or fail to improve  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
a majority of our revenue comes from a small number of customers  if we lose any of our larger customers  our revenue could decline significantly 
our largest three customers in were ibm  ingenico and square d  which represented approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue in our top ten largest customers including ibm  ingenico and square d collectively represented approximately of our total revenue in we expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue 
in addition to having a limited number of customers  we manufacture a limited number of products for each of our customers 
if we lose any of our largest customers or any product line manufactured for one of our largest customers  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenue 
also  the insolvency of one or more of our largest customers or the inability of one or more of our largest customers to pay for its orders could decrease revenue 
as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in net revenue can decrease our profit margins and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our industry is very competitive and we may not be successful if we fail to compete effectively 
the electronics manufacturing services ems industry is highly competitive 
we compete against numerous domestic and foreign ems providers including celestica inc  flextronics international ltd  jabil circuit  inc  sanmina sci  inc  solectron corporation  benchmark electronics inc  pemstar inc and plexus corp 
in addition  we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronics manufacturers that are selling  or may begin to sell  electronics manufacturing services 
many of our competitors have international operations  and some have substantially greater manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources and lower cost structures than us 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers  which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally versus the advantages of using external manufacturers 
we may experience variability in our operating results  which could negatively impact the price of our shares 
our annual and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past 
the reasons for these fluctuations may similarly affect us in the future 
prospective investors should not rely on results of operations in any past period to indicate what our results will be for any future period 
our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including variations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity  variations in the timing of shipments of products to customers  introduction and market acceptance of our customers new products  changes in demand for our customers existing products  the accuracy of our customers forecasts of future production requirements  effectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes and inventory levels  changes in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers markets  willingness of suppliers to supply the company on normal credit terms  and changes in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor 
in addition  most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules more than to days in advance 
accordingly  we cannot forecast the level of customer orders with certainty 
this makes it difficult to schedule production to maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
in the past  we have been required to increase staffing  purchase materials and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers 
sometimes anticipated orders from certain customers have failed to materialize  and at times delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer s business needs 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from our largest customers could cause our revenue to decline significantly 
in addition  as many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand can decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on other occasions  customers have required rapid and unexpected increases in production  which have placed burdens on our manufacturing capacity and adversely affected costs 
in  our costs to meet customer orders increased due to our vendor credit constraints arising from our burdensome debt position  resulting in additional freight and material costs and labor inefficiencies that lowered our margins in the fourth quarter of any of these factors or a combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry  which produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles 
many of our customers are in the electronics industry  which is characterized by intense competition  short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand 
in addition  the electronics industry is generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
if our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment  their products could become obsolete and the demand for our services could significantly decline 
our success is largely dependent on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products 
furthermore  this industry is subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced downturns 
a continued recession or a downturn in the electronics industry would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
shortage or price fluctuation in component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing 
in turnkey manufacturing  we provide both the materials and the manufacturing services 
if we fail to manage our inventory effectively  we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs  scrap and excess inventory  all of which can have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to forecast our future inventory requirements based upon the anticipated demands of our customers 
inaccuracies in making these forecasts or estimates could result in a shortage or an excess of materials 
in addition  delays  cancellations or reductions of orders by our customers could result in an excess of materials 
a shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs 
an excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence  both of which may increase expenses and decrease profit margins and operating income 
many of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole source suppliers 
supply shortages for a particular component can delay productions of all products using that component or cause cost increases in the services we provide 
in addition  in the past  some of the materials we use  such as memory and logic devices  have been subject to industry wide shortages 
as a result  suppliers allocate available quantities among their customers  and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials required 
our inability to obtain these materials could slow production or assembly  delay shipments to our customers  increase costs and reduce operating income 
also  we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases 
accordingly  some component price increases could increase costs and reduce operating income 
also we rely on a variety of common carriers for materials transportation  and we route materials through various world ports 
a work stoppage  strike or shutdown of a major port or airport could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced significant growth and significant retrenchment in a short period of time 
since  we have completed seven acquisitions 
acquisitions may involve numerous risks  including difficulty in integrating operations  technologies  systems  and products and services of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention and disruption of operations  increased expenses and working capital requirements  entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions  and the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired companies 
in addition  acquisitions may involve financial risks  such as the potential liabilities of the acquired businesses  the dilutive effect of the issuance of additional equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the financial impact of transaction expenses and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets involved in any transactions that are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and possible adverse tax and accounting effects 
in we implemented an operational restructuring plan that called for significant retrenchment 
we closed our denver and haverhill facilities and resized operations in mexico and ireland in an effort to reduce our cost structure 
in february  the main customer of our cork  ireland facility was placed into administration as part of a financial restructuring 
as a result  on march   we announced that we were closing our cork  ireland facility and that we were taking steps to place the subsidiary that operates that facility in voluntary administration 
during the third quarter of  the company took further steps to realign its cost structure and plant capacity 
furthermore  in  we closed our sites in austin  texas  donegal  ireland and charlotte  north carolina and sold our manufacturing operations in appleton  wisconsin 
retrenchment has caused  and is expected to continue to cause  strain on our infrastructure  including our managerial  technical and other resources 
we may experience inefficiencies as we complete the operational integretation from closed facilities to currently operating facilities and may experience delays in meeting the needs of transferred customers 
in addition  we are reducing the geographic dispersion of our operations  which may make it harder for us to compete and may cause us to lose customers 
the loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our rapid growth and subsequent retrenchment has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on management  on our financial resources  and on our information  operating and financial systems 
if we are unable to manage effectively  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technology and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development 
the future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to develop and market products and services that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the ems industry could in the future encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services 
there can be no assurance that we will effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market 
to the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
there can be no assurance that capital will be available for these purposes in the future or that investments in new technologies will result in commercially viable technological processes 
our business will suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees 
our business depends on our ability to continue to recruit  train and retain skilled employees  particularly executive management  engineering and sales personnel 
recruiting personnel in our industry is highly competitive 
we are currently seeking a new president and chief executive officer to replace our current interim president and chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer to replace our current interim chief financial officer 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to attract a new president and chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer and to retain key management and existing employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract a new president and chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer or to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract qualified management in the future 
in connection with our restructuring  we significantly reduced our workforce 
if we receive a significant volume of new orders  we may have difficulty recruiting skilled workers back into our workforce to respond to such orders and accordingly may experience delays that could adversely effect our ability to meet customers delivery schedules 
risks particular to our international manufacturing operations could adversely affect our overall results 
our international manufacturing operations are subject to inherent risks  including fluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting amounts receivable  unexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  increases in duties and taxation  imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds  trade restrictions  and dependence on key customers 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws  which expose us to potential financial liability 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state  provincial  local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage and disposal of such materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes 
we may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are or become contaminated by the release of hazardous materials  regardless of whether we caused such release 
in addition we  along with any other person who arranges for the disposal of our wastes  may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated  even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws 
in the event of a contamination or violation of environmental laws  we could be held liable for damages including fines  penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits 
any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  thereby having a material adverse effect on our operations 
environmental laws could also become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our capital structure our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
at december   we had million of indebtedness under our senior credit facility 
if the recapitalization transaction is approved by stockholders at our annual meeting and ultimately consummated  it will reduce our debt  but we will remain leveraged 
this debt  whether under our existing senior credit facility or the facilities that would be put in place as part of the recapitalization transaction  could have adverse consequences for our business  including we will be more vulnerable to adverse general economic conditions  we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes  we may have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  we could be limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit arrangements in our borrowing of additional funds  and we may fail to comply with the covenants under which we borrowed our indebtedness which could result in an event of default 
if an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived  it could result in all amounts outstanding  together with accrued interest  becoming immediately due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such amounts  the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
in addition  our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness to meet our financial and restrictive covenants and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control  as well as the availability of revolving credit borrowings under our senior credit facility or successor facilities 
we face significant restrictions on our ability to operate under the terms of our current credit agreement and would face similar restrictions under the terms of the credit arrangements that would be implemented in the recapitalization transaction 
the terms of our current credit agreement restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  complete acquisitions  pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  make capital expenditures  incur cash restructuring costs  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
we are also required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain monthly and quarterly financial condition tests  which further restrict our ability to operate as we choose 
we would face similar restrictions and requirements under the credit arrangements that are part of the recapitalization transaction 
if we are not able to comply with these covenants and tests  customers may lose confidence in us and reduce or eliminate their orders with us which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are pledged as security under our senior credit facility and would be similarly pledged under the credit arrangements that would be effected in the recapitalization transaction 
institutional investors and certain members of management have significant influence over our business  and could delay  deter or prevent a change of control or other business combination 
certain of our institutional investors have representatives on our board of directors  including investment funds affiliated with bain capital  llc and investment funds affiliated with celerity partners 
further  certain members of our management serve on our board 
by virtue of such stock ownership and board representation  certain of our institutional investors and certain members of management have a significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders  including the election of our directors  and exercise significant control over our business policies and affairs 
such concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions in our charter documents and state law may make it harder for others to obtain control of us even though some stockholders might consider such a development favorable 
provisions in our charter  by laws and certain provisions under delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management that stockholders consider favorable or beneficial 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  the market price of our shares could suffer 
risks associated with our proposed charter amendments the issuance of additional authorized shares of common stock may dilute the voting power and equity interest of present stockholders and may prevent a hostile takeover of the company 
we are seeking stockholder approval to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our charter 
it is not possible to predict in advance whether the issuance of additional shares will have a dilutive effect on earnings per share as it depends on the specific events associated with a particular transaction 
shares of authorized but unissued common stock may be issued from time to time by our board of directors without further stockholder action unless such action is required by delaware law  under which the company is incorporated  our charter  or the rules of the nasdaq national market system 
additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock might be used in the context of a defense against or response to possible or threatened hostile takeovers 
we cannot predict the effect that a reverse stock split would have on the market value of our common stock and our ability to comply with nasdaq s maintenance standards 
we are seeking stockholder approval to effect a reverse stock split 
while our board of directors believes that the common stock and exchangeable shares would trade at higher prices after the consummation of the reverse stock split  there can be no assurance that the increase in the trading price will occur  or  if it does occur  that it will equal or exceed the price that is the product of the market price of our common stock and exchangeable shares prior to the reverse stock split times the selected reverse stock split ratio 
in some cases  the total market capitalization of a company following a reverse stock split is lower  and may be substantially lower  than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split 
in addition  the fewer number of shares that will be available to trade will possibly cause the trading market of our common stock and exchangeable shares to become less liquid  which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and exchangeable shares 
there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in us complying with the minimum bid requirement for continued listing 
even if we continue to satisfy nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement  we must continue to satisfy other nasdaq maintenance standards to remain on the nasdaq national market 
in addition to a minimum bid price of at least per share  we are required to have a total assets and total revenue of at least million  b at least  shares publicly held by persons other than officers  directors and beneficial owners of greater than of our total outstanding shares  c a market value of publicly held shares of at least million  and d at least stockholders who own at least shares 
we cannot offer any assurance that the common stock will continue to meet the nasdaq national market continued listing requirements following the reverse stock split 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our senior credit facility bears interest at a floating rate 
the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facility for the year ended december  was 
our debt of million bore interest at on december  based on the us base rate 
if the us base rate increased by  our interest rate would have risen to  and our interest expense would have increased by approximately million for fiscal year foreign currency exchange risk most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  and as a result we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
as part of the recapitalization transaction  we have agreed to repay million in cash to our existing lenders 
this amount will be generated by borrowings under our new working capital facility and from the proceeds of our equity offering  which  net of underwriting expenses  total cdn million and are held in escrow 
we will be required to convert the escrowed proceeds  upon stockholder approval  to satisfy the obligations to our existing lenders 
in the event the canadian dollar weakens relative to the us dollar  it will have an adverse effect on our ability to purchase us dollars in the amount of approximately us  for every 
change in the canadian dollar us dollar exchange rate 
the company will monitor the exchange rate and the extent it deems necessary  it will hedge all or a portion of the cdn million  however  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its hedging strategy
