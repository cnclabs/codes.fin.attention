quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk introduction cit is a global commercial and consumer finance company that was founded in we provide financing and leasing capital for companies in a wide variety of industries  offering vendor  equipment  commercial  factoring  consumer  and structured financing products 
our primary sources of revenue are interest and rental income related to collateralized lending and equipment leasing 
finance receivables loans and capital leases and operating lease equipment operating leases are the two major asset types that generate this revenue 
in the case of finance receivables which are financial assets  the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership have been transferred to the customer and we retain predominantly the borrower credit risk 
with operating lease equipment  we retain the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership 
we fund our leasing and lending activity via the global capital markets  using commercial paper  unsecured term debt  and securitizations 
we refer to the excess of our interest and rental income over our interest expense as net finance margin 
this revenue is supplemented by other non spread sources of revenue such as syndication fees  gains from dispositions of equipment  factoring commissions  servicing of loans and other fees 
we measure our overall level of profitability with the following metrics o net income as a percentage of average earning assets aea  o net income per common share eps  and o net income as a percentage of average tangible equity rote 
the keys to enhancing profitability in our business are as follows net interest margin our ability to lend money at rates in excess of our cost of borrowing 
we measure this with the following ratios o finance income as a percentage of average earning assets aea  and o net finance income as a percentage of aea 
funding and market rate risk management our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates  which is dependent on the maintenance of high quality assets  strong capital ratios and high credit ratings 
this profitability key is also a function of interest rate risk management  where the goal is to substantially insulate our interest margins and profits from movements in market interest rates and foreign currency rates 
we gauge our funding and interest rate risk management activities with various measurements  including the following o interest expense as a percentage of aea  o quality spread trends our interest rate costs over comparable term us treasury rates  o net finance margin as a percentage of aea  and o various liquidity measurements that are discussed in liquidity risk management 
credit risk management our ability to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers  both during the credit granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds  and to maintain high quality assets 
we assess our credit risk management activities with the following measurements o delinquent assets as a percentage of finance receivables  o non performing assets as a percentage of finance receivables  and o net charge offs as a percentage of average finance receivables 
expense management our ability to maintain efficient operating platforms and infrastructure in order to run our business at competitive cost levels 
we track our efficiency with the following measurements o efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to operating margin excluding the provision for credit losses  and o operating expenses as a percentage of average managed assets ama 
equipment and residual risk management our ability to evaluate collateral risk in leasing and lending transactions and to remarket equipment at lease termination 
we measure these activities with the following o operating lease margin as a percentage of average leased equipment  o gains and losses on equipment sales  and o equipment utilization value of equipment off lease 
asset generation and growth our ability to originate new business and build our earning assets in a focused and prudent manner 
we measure our performance in these areas with the following o origination volumes  o levels of financing and leasing assets and managed assets including finance receivables securitized that we continue to manage  and o levels of non spread and other revenue 
capital management our ability to maintain a strong capital base and adequate credit loss reserve levels 
we measure our performance in these areas with the following o debt to tangible equity ratio  o tangible equity to managed assets ratio  and o reserve for credit losses as a percentage of finance receivables  of delinquent assets  and of non performing assets 
profitability and key business trends in  we improved profitability with each successive quarter 
improved asset quality  lower funding costs and higher asset levels led to this improvement 
the weak economy increased defaults and put downward pressure on collateral values in  particularly in our equipment finance segment 
in response  we intensified our credit and collection efforts  selectively tightened credit underwriting standards and strengthened credit loss reserves 
the combination of these actions  and some economic improvement in the latter part of  resulted in significant improvement in our credit metrics over recent quarters 
we restored our funding base and fully repaid our bank lines in we achieved consistent access to both the commercial paper and term debt markets and we benefited from the significant reduction of our term debt quality spreads interest rate cost over us treasury rates to pre levels 
our funding base was disrupted in following our former parent s announcement of its break up plan and intent to sell cit 
during  we focused on core markets served through our strategic businesses 
organic growth has been modest  consistent with the economic environment 
as a result  we have supplemented growth with strategic portfolio purchases that integrate well with our existing business platforms and meet our financial return requirements 
during the year ended december   we completed the acquisition of a railcar leasing portfolio  and the purchase of two significant factoring portfolios 
focused  prudent growth continues to be a primary goal for we have been liquidating several non strategic product lines 
these include owner operator trucking  franchise  manufactured housing  recreational vehicle and inventory finance loans  which totaled  million at december   compared to  million at december  and  million at september  included in these balances are venture capital investments 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to accelerate the liquidation of the direct investment venture capital portfolio via sale  which resulted in a pre tax fair value write down of million 
we announced on january  that we signed a purchase and sale agreement for the disposition of the direct investment portfolio at a price that approximates the december  book value 
our profitability measurements for the respective periods are presented in the table below year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  net income per diluted share net income as a percentage of aea return on average tangible equity earnings per diluted share calculations for the periods preceding september  assume that diluted common shares outstanding as a result of the july ipo million were outstanding during such historical periods 
the following table summarizes the impact of various items for the respective reporting periods that affect the comparability of our financial results under gaap 
we are presenting these items as a supplement to the gaap results to facilitate the comparability of results between periods 
during  we recognized a gain on the redemption of certain debt instruments and took a charge to write down certain direct private equity investments to estimated fair value following our decision to accelerate the liquidation of this portfolio via a sale 
in and  we took specific reserving actions and recorded other charges 
these transactions are significant  and the exclusion thereof aids in the analysis of results over the periods presented 
the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in october eliminated goodwill amortization and introduced goodwill impairment charges 
the impairment charge in the period ended september  was a non cash charge and did not impact our tangible capital 
the tch results relate to a tyco acquisition company that had temporary status with respect to tyco s acquisition of cit 
for these reasons  we believe that this table  in addition to the gaap results  aids in the analysis of the significant trends in our business over the periods presented in millions year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  net income loss gaap basis  charges gains included in net income loss venture capital losses gains gain on debt redemption goodwill impairment  goodwill amortization specific reserving actions and other charges tch losses net income before charges gains this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk contain certain non gaap financial measures

the sections that follow analyze our results by financial statement caption and are referenced back to the profitability keys that are discussed in introduction 
net finance margin an analysis of net finance margin is set forth below in millions year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  finance income    interest expense    net finance income    depreciation on operating lease equipment    net finance margin    average earnings asset aea     as a of aea finance income interest expense net finance income depreciation on operating lease equipment net finance margin we utilize these ratios and trends to assess our funding and market risk management activities 
finance income for reflected the continued decline in market interest rates 
however  interest expense did not decline directly with the corresponding drop in market interest rates due to the use of bank lines drawn in for part of  term debt issued in at wider credit spreads and excess cash maintained for liquidity purposes 
therefore  net finance margin as percentage of aea decreased in from the prior periods 
finance income interest on loans and lease rentals as a percentage of aea declined in each period since this primarily reflected the drop in us treasury rates of approximately basis points from the first quarter of through the second quarter of reduced operating lease rentals  as discussed further below  also contributed to the decline 
interest expense as a percentage of aea also declined since  as the favorable impact of lower market interest rates was partially offset by wider borrowing spreads and the resultant higher cost of funding done following the funding base disruption 
at december   billion in outstanding commercial paper was fully supported by undrawn bank facilities 
at december   september  and september   commercial paper outstanding was billion  billion and billion  respectively  while drawn commercial bank lines were billion  billion and  respectively 
net finance margin as a percentage of aea improved modestly in over  as the benefit of a number of positive factors were mitigated by the impact of wider credit spreads and the other factors mentioned above that followed the funding base disruption and continued into the liquidation or disposal of non strategic and under performing businesses  lower leverage and the effect of fair value adjustments in the new basis of accounting recorded as adjustments to goodwill to reflect market interest rates on debt and assets were among the positive factors 
aea declined during due to increased securitization activity  the runoff of non strategic  liquidating portfolios and the slower economy  while the renewed focus on asset growth during the current year led to the increase in aea led to the increase 
the following table summarizes the trend in our quality spreads in relation to year us treasuries 
amounts are in basis points and represent the average spread or cost of funds over comparable term us treasury securities year three months year nine months year ended ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  december  average spread over us treasuries us since our ipo  we have readily accessed the term markets  issuing billion in term debt  comprised of billion in floating rate debt and billion in fixed rate debt 
as the table shows  our borrowing spreads have recently returned to near historical levels 
the funding base disruption in the first half of resulted in a period of increased funding cost with our borrowing spreads being higher than traditionally experienced 
on february   we issued million of year senior fixed rate notes at basis points over us treasuries 
operating leases the table below summarizes operating lease margin  both in amount and as a percentage of average operating lease equipment in millions year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  rental income    depreciation expense    operating lease margin average operating lease equipment     as a of average operating lease equipment rental income depreciation expense operating lease margin these trends and ratios are measurements of our equipment risk management activities 
the decline in operating lease margin and its components for the above periods reflects lower rentals on the aerospace portfolio due to the commercial airline industry downturn and the simultaneous change in equipment mix to a greater proportion of aircraft and rail assets with an average depreciable life of and years  respectively  from smaller ticket assets with lives generally of years in the specialty finance and equipment finance portfolios 
the following table summarizes the total operating lease portfolio by segment in millions 
december  december  september  september  capital finance aerospace     capital finance rail and other     specialty finance    equipment finance  structured finance total     o the increases in the capital finance aerospace portfolio reflects deliveries of new commercial aircraft 
o the increase in capital finance rail assets in was due to an acquisition 
o the declines in the specialty finance and equipment finance operating lease portfolios are a result of the continued trend toward financing equipment through finance leases and loans in these segments 
o the structured finance increase was primarily in the regional aerospace portfolio 
management strives to maximize the profitability of the lease equipment portfolio by balancing equipment utilization levels with market rental rates and lease terms 
equipment not subject to lease agreements totaled million  million  and million at december  and  and september   respectively 
the higher december  off lease equipment balance primarily reflects the higher level of commercial aircraft and rail assets off lease in capital finance at that time 
the current weakness in the commercial airline industry and the slower economy could adversely impact prospective rental and utilization rates 
net finance margin after provision for credit losses risk adjusted margin the following table summarizes risk adjusted margin  both in amount and as a percentage of aea in millions year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  net finance margin    provision for credit losses risk adjusted margin as a percentage of aea net finance margin provision for credit losses risk adjusted margin excluding the additional credit provisions in to establish reserves for the telecommunications and argentine exposures  and certain specific telecommunication provisions  risk adjusted margin as a percentage of aea was for the twelve months ended september   and for the combined nine months ended september  on this basis  the trend down to for the full year primarily reflects the previously discussed net finance margin trends 
in conjunction with the june acquisition related fresh start accounting  we used discounted cash flow projection analysis to estimate the fair value of our various liquidating portfolios by modeling the portfolio revenues  credit costs  servicing costs and other related expenses over the remaining lives of the portfolios 
these discounts are being accreted into income as the portfolios liquidate 
the positive impact on risk adjusted margin due to purchase accounting fair value adjustments related to the liquidating portfolios were basis points for the year ended december   basis points for the three months ended december   basis points for the year ended september   and basis points for the combined nine months ended september  in addition  risk adjusted interest margin was impacted positively due to fair value adjustments to mark receivables and debt to market in conjunction with the tyco acquisition by approximately basis points for the year ended december   basis points for the three months ended december   basis points for the twelve months ended september  and basis points for the combined nine months ended september  other revenue the components of other revenue are set forth in the following table in millions

we continue to emphasize growth and diversification of other revenues to improve our overall profitability 
o fees and other income include servicing fees  miscellaneous fees  syndication fees and gains from asset sales 
for the year ended december   fees and other income  while still strong in our commercial finance segment  were derived from more traditional  smaller working capital asset based lending facilities and less from the larger ticket debtor in possession lending that drove the activity 
o higher factoring commissions than in the prior periods reflect both higher volume and higher commission rates  as well as some impact from one of the two large acquisitions completed during the second half of the year 
o securitization volume  including consumer home equity loans  increased in to meet funding and liquidity needs 
we have since returned to more normal securitization levels and have de emphasized securitizing home equity loans in light of lower cost  on balance sheet funding 
we continue to target maximum securitization gains at of pretax income 
o gains on sales of equipment improved sharply from prior periods as we saw firming of prices during the year  particularly in the mid ticket equipment and rail portfolios 
o other charges in  consisting of write downs for other than temporary impairment of certain equity investments in the telecommunications industry and e commerce markets  were recorded as reductions to other revenue 
losses on venture capital investments during the fourth quarter of  we decided to accelerate the liquidation of the venture capital direct investment portfolio and marketed the portfolio to prospective buyers 
the resulting indications of value contributed to a pre tax fair value write down of million 
we announced on january   that we signed a purchase and sales agreement for the disposition of the direct investment portfolio at an amount approximating the carrying value at december  losses on venture capital investments also include realized losses on both direct investments and venture capital fund investments for all periods presented 
gain on redemption of debt we had billion of term debt securities outstanding that were callable at par in december and january these notes were listed on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbols cic and cip and are commonly known as pines public income notes 
the securities carried coupon rates of and  but were marked down to a yield of approximately in cit s financial statements through purchase accounting adjustments 
in light of the high coupon rates  we called the securities for redemption pursuant to the terms outlined in the prospectuses 
the december call of million resulted in a pretax gain of million million after tax  as these securities had been adjusted to reflect market interest rates in conjunction with the june new basis of accounting 
the call of the remaining million on january  resulted in an additional pretax gain of million million after tax  which will be reflected in the first quarter results

the provision in reflects the transfer of specific argentine reserves to other portfolio reserves 
the reserve for credit losses as a percentage of past due receivables days or more  excluding telecommunication and argentine reserves and corresponding delinquencies  was at december   at december  and at september  the reserve for credit losses as a percentage of non performing assets  excluding telecommunication and argentine reserves and corresponding non performing assets  was at december   at december  and at september  the decreased provision for the year ended december  in relation to reflects lower charge offs excluding argentina and improving credit metrics 
the increased provision for the year ended september  reflects higher charge off levels and reserving actions relating to exposures in the telecommunications portfolio million primarily to competitive local exchange carriers clecs  and our argentine exposure million  detailed further below 
the provision includes a provision for credit losses of million relating to the impairment of certain under performing equipment leasing and loan portfolios  primarily in the structured finance telecommunications portfolio

o the increased capital finance charge offs were primarily the result of an million charge off recorded to write down the value of a waste to energy project following bankruptcy proceedings and the renegotiation of the related contracts 
o the structured finance charge offs continue to be driven by telecommunication charge offs 
the higher loss rates in the commercial finance segment in reflect charge offs associated with several loan work outs due to the weaker economic trends 
the higher net charge off percentages for the year ended september  in relation to also reflect higher charge off rates associated with receivables in liquidation status  which included owner operator trucking  franchise  inventory finance  manufactured housing and recreational vehicle receivables  as well as charge offs in the telecommunications portfolio

percentage of finance receivables in argentina 
the decline in the reserve for credit losses at december   in both amount and percentage  from the periods was due to argentine and telecommunication portfolio charge offs 
the changes in percentages of reserves to finance receivables during the periods shown in the above table reflects the weakening economic conditions and deteriorating internal credit metrics in followed by improvements in the increase to million in the finance receivables reserve in total dollars during reflects portfolio growth during the current year 
reserve for credit losses finance receivables the reserve for credit losses is determined based on three key components specific reserves for collateral dependent loans which are impaired under sfas  reserves for estimated losses inherent in the portfolio based upon historical and projected credit trends and reserves for general economic environment and other factors 
the reserve includes specific reserves relating to impaired loans of million at december   million at december   million at september  and million at september  the changes in the inherent estimated loss and estimation risk components of the reserve reflect trends in our key credit metrics as mentioned above 
the consolidated reserve for credit losses is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio  which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral  among other things 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or credit metrics  including past due and non performing accounts  or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may necessitate additions or reductions to the consolidated reserve for credit losses 
management continues to believe that the credit risk characteristics of the portfolio are well diversified by geography  industry  borrower and equipment type 
refer to concentrations for more information 
based on currently available information  management believes that our total reserve for credit losses is adequate 
reserve for credit losses telecommunications in light of the continued deterioration in the telecommunications sector  particularly with respect to our clec portfolio  we added million to the reserve for credit losses during the quarter ended june  in the subsequent quarters through december   we have recorded net write offs of million against this specific reserve 
our telecommunications portfolio is included in communications in the industry composition table included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this portfolio includes lending and leasing transactions to the telecommunications sector 
lending and leasing telecommunication equipment to non telecom companies is conducted in our specialty finance business and is included in the lessee s industry in the industry composition table

when established  the reserve was about two thirds of our combined currency and credit exposure 
during the fourth quarter of  based on the substantial progress with collection and work out efforts  we recorded a million charge off against this specific reserve and transferred million to the reserve for credit losses finance receivables 
at december   we have million in argentina loans that remains to be collected and repatriated 
the remaining reserve million reflects our estimate of future loss related to these balances 
salaries and general operating expenses the efficiency ratio and the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to average managed assets ama are summarized in the following table in millions 
year three months year nine months ended ended ended ended december  december  september  september  efficiency ratio salaries and general operating expenses as a percentage of ama salaries and general operating expenses average managed assets     note ratios exclude expenses relating to tch  a tyco acquisition company that had temporary status with respect to tyco s acquisition of cit 
salaries and general operating expenses for the year ended december  increased from the prior periods primarily due to incentive based compensation and other employee benefit expenses  as well as from expenses associated with our return to public ownership  which include investor relations  advertising  corporate governance  increased insurance premiums  and costs associated with rebuilding our income tax function 
these increased expenses were mitigated by lower collection and repossession expenses 
the decreased expenses for the year ended september  compared to the annualized run rate for the combined nine months ended september  were due to corporate staff reductions and business restructurings effected in  which were partially offset by higher collection  repossession and loan workout expenses in the latter part of through personnel decreased to approximately  at december   from  at december    at september   and  at september  the deterioration in the efficiency ratio for the year ended december  and three months ended december  is principally the result of lower revenues in the respective periods as well as somewhat higher expenses 
similarly  the deterioration in the ratio of salaries and general operating expenses to ama from the september  fiscal year reflects reduced levels of average managed assets 
expenses are monitored closely by business unit and corporate management and are reviewed monthly 
an approval and review procedure is in place for major capital expenditures  such as computer equipment and software  including post implementation evaluations 
we continue to target an improved efficiency ratio in the mid area and an ama ratio of under  as we have existing capacity to grow assets without commensurate expense increases 
this efficiency improvement will be partially offset by higher expenditures related to corporate governance and compliance

the fluctuations in the equipment finance and specialty finance commercial also reflects the transfer in march of small business loans and leases from equipment finance to specialty finance commercial 
past due accounts related to these transferred portfolios approximated million  million and million at december   december  and september   respectively 
prior periods have not been restated to reflect this transfer 
o absent the transfer  specialty finance commercial delinquency improved  reflecting the continued decline in past dues in international portfolios  including european operations where servicing was centralized during o the commercial finance decline from both periods was due to improvements in both the commercial services factoring and business credit asset based lending units 
o capital finance delinquency improved million during  due to the return to earning status of a waste to energy project and lower delinquency in the aerospace portfolio 
see provision for credit losses for additional discussion of the waste to energy charge 
o though up in amount from  specialty finance consumer delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables improved  reflecting a return to on balance growth in this portfolio during this is in contrast to when higher quality consumer assets were securitized to meet funding requirements 
as shown in the table below  consumer delinquency on a managed basis has been relatively stable in percentage over the periods presented 
non performing assets also declined for the fifth consecutive quarter  and constitute the lowest levels since  reflecting the same trends discussed above  namely considerable improvement in the equipment finance and capital finance segments 
in addition to the above mentioned waste to energy project  the capital finance reduction from december  also reflects the conversion of united airlines receivables million to short term operating leases following the carrier s december chapter bankruptcy filing 
non performing telecommunications accounts in structured finance totaled million  million and million at december   december  and september   respectively 
trends past due loans at december  declined million from september   to of finance receivables versus 
this reflected improvements in most businesses  particularly commercial finance and specialty finance commercial 
the decline in commercial finance reflected the conclusion of several large loan work outs  while the specialty finance commercial improvement included lower delinquency in the european operations and vendor programs 
non performing assets decreased million from september  due to reductions in commercial finance and structured finance 
the equipment finance non performing assets declined sharply during the quarter  but were more than offset by additional aerospace assets placed on non accrual in capital finance relating to the bankruptcy filing of ual corp  the parent company of united airlines 
past due loans decreased million from september  to september  however  due to increased securitization activity and declining asset levels  the percentage of past due receivables increased over the same time period 
after peaking in march   there was steady improvement in specialty finance commercial past dues 
specialty finance consumer past due portfolio metrics were down in dollar terms  but up in percentage of finance receivables  due to the continued runoff of liquidating portfolios and the home equity securitization activity  which lowered owned asset levels during the year 
non performing assets also trended downwards from december  reflecting improvement across the majority of our small ticket businesses and runoff of our liquidating portfolio assets 
however  non performing assets increased from september  to september   both in dollars and as a percentage of finance receivables  due to increased telecommunications clec exposure non accrual accounts in structured finance  the previously discussed municipal waste to energy project in capital finance  increased non accrual accounts in the small business administration lending unit of equipment finance transferred to specialty finance in and increased repossessed assets in equipment finance 
past due and non performing assets of commercial finance were up from september to september  mainly due to two large customer balances

income taxes the following table sets for the certain information concerning our income taxes in millions year three months year combined nine ended ended ended months ended december  december  september  september  provision for income taxes effective tax rates effective tax rates excluding goodwill impairment  goodwill amortization and tch results at december   cit had us federal net operating losses of approximately  million  which expire in various years beginning in in addition  cit has various state net operating losses that will expire in various years beginning in federal and state net operating losses may be subject to annual use limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and other limitations under certain state laws 
management believes that cit will have sufficient taxable income in future years and can avail itself of tax planning strategies in order to fully utilize these losses 
accordingly  cit does not believe a valuation allowance is required with respect to these net operating losses 
in connection with the june acquisition by tyco  our income tax compliance  reporting and planning function was transferred to tyco 
following our ipo  we classified our tax reporting as a reportable condition  as defined by standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants 
we have made substantial progress in rebuilding our tax reporting and compliance functions  including hiring and training personnel  rebuilding tax reporting systems  preparing amendments to prior period us federal income tax returns  and implementing processes and controls with respect to income tax reporting and compliance 
we have built processes to prepare a tax basis balance sheet to complete the analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of december  further work continues in the areas of quality control  proof and reconciliation and we anticipate completing this initiative during the second or third quarter of future income tax return filings and the completion of the aforementioned analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities could result in reclassifications to deferred tax assets and liabilities

segment returns for versus the periods were reduced by the allocation of all borrowing costs in the current year 
noteworthy trends by segment are as follows o return on aea for specialty finance  while below  was in line with corporate return on equity hurdles 
the specialty finance performance for included improved earnings in international operations and strong earnings from vendor programs  offset by slightly higher charge offs and reduced securitization gains from o commercial finance earnings remained very strong  benefiting from continued high returns in both the factoring and asset based lending businesses 
o equipment finance returns reflected soft margins  offset in part by reduced charge offs in relation to o capital finance earnings were dampened by the lower aerospace rental rates and the waste to energy project charge off described previously in provision for credit losses 
o structured finance returns for remained in line with corporate return on equity hurdles and reflected strong advisory and syndication fees  offset by higher charge offs 
with respect to trends o net income improved sharply in specialty finance over based on stronger margins and higher securitization gains 
o commercial finance also showed improvement from due to stronger factoring revenues on increased business volume 
o equipment finance reported reduced net income and return on assets due to lower portfolio assets and higher charge offs 
o capital finance experienced a decline in net income and return on assets due to lower aerospace rental income 
corporate funding costs increased significantly in from  reflecting management s decision to not allocate to the business units the incremental costs of borrowing and liquidity relating to the disruption to our funding base and credit downgrades 
such additional costs included higher debt quality spreads  use of bank line versus commercial paper borrowings  incremental cost of liquidity facilities  and excess cash held to enhance liquidity 
although management chose to not allocate these incremental costs because they were viewed as relating to temporary conditions  costs were allocated beginning january  for all periods shown  corporate includes the results of the venture capital business

prior periods have not been restated to conform to this current presentation 
the primary factors that fueled the increase in financing and leasing portfolio assets during include two factoring acquisitions in commercial services  growth in business credit  the combination of a strong refinancing market and our decision to limit securitization activity in the specialty finance home equity portfolio  a rail acquisition and deliveries of aerospace assets in capital finance 
the trend of declining asset levels reflects the increased use of securitization as a funding tool in and the liquidation of non strategic assets 
the targeted non strategic business lines and products were sold or placed in liquidation status  and we ceased originating new business in these areas 
in addition  during we ceased making new venture capital investments beyond existing commitments 
during the fourth quarter of  we decided to accelerate the liquidation of the venture capital direct investment portfolio

joint venture relationships our strategic relationships with industry leading equipment vendors are a significant origination channel for our financing and leasing activities 
these vendor alliances include traditional vendor finance programs  joint ventures and profit sharing structures 
our vendor programs with dell  snap on and avaya inc are among our largest alliances 
the joint venture agreements with dell and snap on run until october and january  respectively 
the avaya agreement  which relates to profit sharing on a cit direct origination program  extends through september at december   our financing and leasing assets included  million   million and million related to the dell  snap on and avaya programs  respectively 
these amounts include receivables originated directly by cit as well as receivables purchased from joint venture entities 
securitized assets included  million  million and million from the dell  snap on and avaya origination sources  respectively

industry composition the following discussions provide information with respect to selected industry compositions 
aerospace at december   our commercial aerospace portfolio in capital finance consists of financing and leasing assets of  million covering aircraft  with an average age of approximately years based on a dollar value weighted average 
the portfolio was comprised of accounts  with the majority placed with major airlines around the world 
the commercial aerospace portfolio at december  was  million of financing and leasing assets  which covered aircraft and accounts  with a weighted average age of approximately years 
the commercial aircraft all comply with stage iii noise regulations 
the increase during was due to new aircraft deliveries from both airbus and boeing

narrow body are single aisle design and consist primarily of boeing and series and airbus a series aircraft 
intermediate body are smaller twin aisle design and consist primarily of boeing series and airbus a series aircraft 
wide body are large twin aisle design and consist primarily of boeing and series and mcdonnell douglass dc series aircraft 
as of december   operating leases represented approximately of the portfolio  with the remainder consisting of capital leases including leveraged leases and loans 
tax optimization leveraged leases were approximately million while total leveraged leases  including the tax optimization structures  were million or of the aerospace portfolio at december  of the aircraft  are off lease  of which have been remarketed with leases pending as of december  in general  the use of leverage increases the risk of a loss in the event of a default  with the greatest risk incurred in tax optimization leveraged leases 
the top five commercial aerospace exposures totaled  million at december   the largest of which was million 
all top five are to carriers outside of the us and the top three are to european carriers 
the largest exposure to a us carrier at december  was million 
future revenues and aircraft values could be impacted by the actions of the carriers  management s actions with respect to re marketing the aircraft  airline industry performance and aircraft utilization 
the regional aircraft portfolio at december  consists of planes and a net investment of million  and is concentrated primarily in structured finance 
the carriers are primarily located in north america and europe 
operating leases account for about of the portfolio  with the rest capital leases or loans 
there are aircraft that are off lease at december  with a total book value of approximately million 
at december   the portfolio consisted of planes and a net investment of million 
the following is a list of our exposure to bankrupt aerospace carriers and the current status of the related aircraft at december  o ual corp 
under existing operating lease agreements  united airlines leases cit owned narrow body aircraft boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft with a net investment of million 
o avianca airlines lessee of one md aircraft and one boeing  with a combined net investment of million at december  o air canada our net investment in aircraft is approximately million  relating to one boeing aircraft which was converted from an investment in a non accrual leveraged lease not a tax optimized structure to a performing operating lease during  and a million loan collateralized by bombardier dash aircraft 
the loan is collateralized by the bombardier aircraft and fully guaranteed by the canadian government 
o sobelair filed a bankruptcy proceeding in belgium  in january  which resulted in a liquidation of the airline 
at that time  we had two boeing aircraft on operating lease to sobelair  one of which was scheduled for return in march by agreement with sobelair s trustee  we took possession of both of these aircraft in january we have leased one aircraft and have agreed to lease terms for the other aircraft 
our net investment in these aircraft at december  was approximately million 
additionally  we hold senior a tranche enhanced equipment trust certificates eetcs with a fair value of million issued by united airlines  which are debt instruments collateralized by aircraft operated by the airline 
in connection with united airlines filing under chapter  we are a co arranger in a billion secured revolving and term loan facility with a commitment of million 
this debtor in possession facility  with an outstanding balance of million at december   is secured by  among other collateral  previously unencumbered aircraft 
our aerospace assets include both operating leases and capital leases 
management monitors economic conditions affecting equipment values  trends in equipment values  and periodically obtains third party appraisals of commercial aerospace equipment  which include projected rental rates 
we adjust the depreciation schedules of commercial aerospace equipment on operating leases or residual values underlying capital leases  when required 
aerospace assets are reviewed for impairment annually  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
an aerospace asset is defined as impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flow over its expected remaining life is less than its book value 
both historical information and current economic trends are factored into the assumptions and analyses used when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow 
included among these assumptions are the following o lease terms o remaining life of the asset o lease rates supplied by independent appraisers o remarketing prospects o maintenance costs an impairment loss is recognized if circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
for the year ended december   a million commercial aerospace impairment loss was recorded  as indicated by the excess of asset book value over corresponding fair value for those aircraft determined to be impaired 
utilization is high  with only five aircraft off lease at december  three of which have letters of intent signed  which demonstrates our ability to place aircraft 
however  these current placements are at compressed rental rates  which reflect current market conditions 
generally  leases are being written for terms between three and five years 
see note commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding commitments to purchase additional aircraft 
equity and venture capital investments our portfolio of direct and private fund venture capital equity investments is summarized in the following table in millions

other assets other assets totaled billion at both december  and december   and billion at september  other assets primarily consisted of the following at december  accrued interest and receivables from derivative counterparties of billion  investments in and receivables from non consolidated subsidiaries of billion  deposits on commercial aerospace flight equipment of billion  direct and private fund equity investments of billion  prepaid expenses of billion and repossessed assets and off lease equipment of billion 
the remaining balance includes furniture and fixtures  miscellaneous receivables and other assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment and amortization we periodically review and evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment 
effective october  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  under which goodwill is no longer amortized but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually 
as part of the adoption  we allocated goodwill to each of our reporting units 
under the transition provisions of sfas  there was no goodwill impairment as of october  during the quarter ended march   in connection with its announced break up plan  our former parent  tyco  experienced disruptions to its business  downgrades in its credit ratings  and a significant decline in its market capitalization  which also disrupted our access to capital markets 
as a result  management performed impairment analyses during the quarters ended march  and june  these analyses resulted in goodwill impairment charges of billion and billion for the quarters ended march  and june   respectively 
we performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of october   which indicated that the fair value of goodwill was in excess of carrying value 
therefore  additional impairment charges were not required 
the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows in millions specialty commercial finance finance total balance as of december  severance reserve reduction balance as of december  the downward revision to severance liabilities during the year ended december  represents previously established reserves that were no longer required 
the revision was related to specialty finance restructuring activities and was recorded as a reduction to goodwill  because the severance liability was established in conjunction with tyco acquisition purchase accounting adjustments 
other intangible assets  net  comprised primarily of acquired customer relationships  proprietary computer software and related transaction processes  totaled million  at december   million at december   million at september  and million at september   and are included in goodwill and intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in other intangible assets during the year ended december  relates to customer relationships acquired in the purchase of two factoring businesses 
other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over their respective lives that range from five to twenty years 
amortization expense totaled million for the year ended december   million for the three months ended december   million for the year ended september   and there was no amortization expense for the combined nine month period ended september  results and trends in relation to the prior year twelve months the following analysis is provided in addition to the required analysis of gaap periods to discuss year over prior year trends in our business on a calendar basis 
we believe this analysis provides additional meaningful information on a comparative basis 
the balances provided for the twelve month period are non gaap and are derived by the combination of results for the three month transition period ended december  and the nine months ended september  net income for totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to the net loss of  million or proforma diluted loss per share 
the results for included two significant transactions 
first  we recognized a pre tax gain of million  related to the early redemption of million in term debt 
second  a determination to accelerate the liquidation of our direct investment venture capital portfolio and the related marketing efforts to prospective buyers resulted in a pre tax fair value write down of million 
net income for  excluding the gain on the debt call and venture capital losses  was million 
net income for includes goodwill impairment charge of  million  million of telecommunication and argentine reserving actions  charges of million for tch related expenses and losses on our venture capital portfolio of million 
excluding these items  net income was million 
the reduction in net income reflects primarily lower net finance margin due to higher funding costs 
the table that follows presents results for the year ended december  and the twelve months ended december   both in amount and as a percentage of aea in millions 
year ended twelve months ended december  december  amount aea amount aea finance income   interest expense   net finance income   depreciation on operating lease equipment   net finance margin   provision for credit losses net finance margin after provision for credit losses other revenue loss on venture capital investments operating margin   salaries and general operating expenses goodwill impairment  interest expense tch operating expenses  gain on call of debt income before provision for income taxes  provision for income taxes dividends on preferred capital securities  after tax net income  aea   although net finance margin was down from the prior year  we demonstrated steady improvement in profitability throughout as we benefited from a return to historical debt spread levels in relation to us treasuries 
the compression in rental rates  particularly in aerospace assets  also contributed to the margin compression 
interest expense decreased due to the low interest rate environment  but was tempered by debt issued last year and through a portion of this year at higher spread levels 
we also maintained excess liquidity throughout the year 
the drop in depreciation expense from the prior year reflects the growth of the longer lived aerospace and rail equipment portfolios  coupled with lower operating lease equipment levels with shorter lives in both specialty finance and equipment finance 
our depreciable assets range from smaller ticket  shorter term leases eg computers to larger ticket  longer term leases eg commercial aircraft and rail assets 
the provision for credit losses decreased million from last year due to the prior year reserving actions of million relating to the telecommunications and argentine portfolios  and improved credit quality  most notably in equipment finance 
for  other revenue totaled million  down from million in fees and other income  which includes servicing fees  miscellaneous fees  syndication fees and gains from asset sales  were down  primarily in equipment finance 
factoring commissions were up slightly in although we acquired two factoring portfolios  these transactions were completed later in the year and had a modest impact on the improvement 
we witnessed a strengthening in equipment sales values  both on large and smaller ticket assets  as noted by the increase on gains from these sales  primarily in specialty finance 
securitization gains during totaled million  of pretax income  on volume of  million  down from million  of pretax income excluding goodwill impairment  tch charges and reserving action charges on volume of  million for in we securitized home equity loans for liquidity purposes  whereas in we de emphasized securitizing home equity loans because on balance sheet funding costs were lower 
salaries and general operating expenses were million  compared to million excluding tch expenses for the increase from last year included higher incentive based compensation  and incremental expenses associated with our return to public ownership  which were in part offset by lower legal and collection expenses 
salaries and general operating expenses were of average managed assets for  essentially unchanged from in the efficiency ratio for salaries and general operating expenses divided by operating margin  excluding provision for credit losses was  compared to in headcount was  at december   compared to  in risk management our business activities involve various elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of risk to be credit risk including credit  collateral and equipment risk and market risk including interest rate  foreign currency and liquidity risk 
managing risks is essential to conducting our commercial and consumer businesses and to our profitability 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze key business risks  to set appropriate policies and limits  and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems  along with other policies and programs 
we performed additional risk management procedures in and into in light of the factors discussed previously in the profitability and key business trends section 
during the third quarter of  we further elevated the prominence of risk management throughout the organization with the establishment of the newly created position of vice chairman chief credit officer within the office of the chairman 
we review and monitor credit exposures  both owned and managed  on an ongoing basis to identify  as early as possible  customers that may be experiencing declining creditworthiness or financial difficulty  and periodically evaluate the performance of our finance receivables across the entire organization 
we monitor concentrations by borrower  industry  geographic region and equipment type  and we set or modify exposure limits as conditions warrant to minimize credit concentrations and the risk of substantial credit loss 
we have maintained a standard practice of reviewing our aerospace portfolio regularly and  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we test for asset impairment based upon projected cash flows and relevant market data  with any impairment in value charged to earnings 
given the developments in the aerospace sector during and  performance  profitability and residual values relating to aerospace assets have been reviewed more frequently with the executive credit committee 
our asset quality review committee is comprised of members of senior management  including the vice chairman chief credit officer  the vice chairman chief financial officer  the chief risk officer  the controller and the director of credit audit 
periodically  the committee meets with senior executives of our business units and corporate credit risk management group to review portfolio performance  including the status of individual financing and leasing assets  owned and managed  to obligors with higher risk profiles 
in addition  this committee periodically meets with the chief executive officer of cit to review overall credit risk  including geographic  industry and customer concentrations  and the reserve for credit losses 
credit risk management we have developed systems specifically designed to manage credit risk in each of our business segments 
we evaluate financing and leasing assets for credit and collateral risk during the credit granting process and periodically after the advancement of funds 
the corporate credit risk management group  which reports to the vice chairman and chief credit officer  oversees and manages credit risk throughout cit 
this group includes senior credit executives in each of the business units  as well as a senior executive with corporate wide asset recovery and workout responsibilities 
our executive credit committee includes the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief credit officer and members of the corporate credit risk management group 
the committee approves transactions which are outside of established target market definitions and risk acceptance criteria  corporate exceptions as delineated within the individual business unit credit authority and transactions that exceed the strategic business units credit authority 
the corporate credit risk management group also includes an independent credit audit function 
each of our strategic business units has developed and implemented a formal credit management process in accordance with formal uniform guidelines established by the credit risk management group 
these guidelines set forth risk acceptance criteria for o acceptable maximum credit lines  o selected target markets and products  o creditworthiness of borrowers  including credit history  financial condition  adequacy of cash flow  financial performance and quality of management  and o the type and value of underlying collateral and guarantees including recourse from dealers and manufacturers 
compliance with established corporate policies and procedures and the credit management processes at each strategic business unit are reviewed by the credit audit group 
the credit audit group examines adherence with established credit policies and procedures and tests for inappropriate credit practices  including whether potential problem accounts are being detected and reported on a timely basis 
commercial credit risk management the commercial credit management process other than small ticket leasing transactions begins with the initial evaluation of credit risk and underlying collateral at the time of origination and continues over the life of the finance receivable or operating lease  including collecting past due balances and liquidating underlying collateral 
credit personnel review a potential borrower s financial condition  results of operations  management  industry  customer base  operations  collateral and other data  such as third party credit reports  to thoroughly evaluate the customer s borrowing and repayment ability 
borrowers are graded according to credit quality based upon our uniform credit grading system  which considers both the borrower s financial condition and the underlying collateral 
credit facilities are subject to approval within our overall credit approval and underwriting guidelines and are issued commensurate with the credit evaluation performed on each borrower 
consumer and small ticket leasing lending for consumer transactions and small ticket leasing lending transactions  we employ proprietary automated credit scoring models by loan type that include customer demographics and credit bureau characteristics 
the profiles emphasize  among other things  occupancy status  length of residence  employment  debt to income ratio ratio of total installment debt and housing expenses to gross monthly income  bank account references  credit bureau information  combined loan to value ratio  length of time in business  industry category and geographic location 
the models are used to assess a potential borrower s credit standing and repayment ability considering the value or adequacy of property offered as collateral 
our credit criteria include reliance on credit scores  including those based upon both our proprietary internal credit scoring model and external credit bureau scoring  combined with judgment 
the credit scoring models are regularly reviewed for effectiveness utilizing statistical tools 
we regularly evaluate the consumer loan portfolio and the small ticket leasing portfolio using past due  vintage curve and other statistical tools to analyze trends and credit performance by loan type  including analysis of specific credit characteristics and other selected subsets of the portfolios 
adjustments to credit scorecards and lending programs are made when deemed appropriate 
individual underwriters are assigned credit authority based upon their experience  performance and understanding of the underwriting policies and procedures of our consumer and small ticket leasing operations 
a credit approval hierarchy also exists to ensure that an underwriter with the appropriate level of authority reviews all applications 
equipment residual risk management we have developed systems  processes and expertise to manage the equipment and residual risk in our commercial segments 
our process consists of the following setting residual value at deal inception  systematic residual reviews  and monitoring of residual realizations 
reviews for impairment are performed at least annually 
residual realizations  by business unit and product  are reviewed as part of our ongoing financial and asset quality review  both within the business units and by senior management 
market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from changes in values of financial instruments  and includes interest rate risk  foreign exchange risk  derivative credit risk and liquidity risk 
we engage in transactions in the normal course of business that expose us to market risks 
we conduct what we believe are appropriate management practices and maintain policies designed to effectively mitigate such risks 
the objectives of our market risk management efforts are to preserve the economic and accounting returns of our assets by matching the repricing and maturity characteristics of our assets with that of our liabilities 
strategies for managing market risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates are an integral part of the process  because those strategies affect our future expected cash flows as well as our cost of capital 
our capital committee sets policies  oversees and guides the interest rate and currency risk management process  including the establishment and monitoring of risk metrics  and ensures the implementation of those policies 
other risks monitored by the capital committee include derivative credit risk and liquidity risk 
the capital committee meets periodically and includes the chief executive officer  chief operating officer  vice chairman and chief financial officer  vice chairman and chief credit officer  vice chairman specialty finance  treasurer  and controller  with business unit executives serving on a rotating basis 
interest rate and foreign exchange risk management we offer a variety of financing products to our customers  including fixed and floating rate loans of various maturities and currency denominations  and a variety of leases  including operating leases 
changes in market interest rates  relationships between short term and long term market interest rates  or relationships between different interest rate indices ie  basis risk can affect the interest rates charged on interest earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and can result in an increase in interest expense relative to finance income 
we measure our asset liability position in economic terms through duration measures and sensitivity analysis  and we measure the effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis 
a matched asset liability position is generally achieved through a combination of financial instruments  including commercial paper  medium term notes  long term debt  interest rate and currency swaps  foreign exchange contracts  and through securitization 
we do not speculate on interest rates or foreign exchange rates  but rather seek to mitigate the possible impact of such rate fluctuations encountered in the normal course of business 
this process is ongoing due to prepayments  refinancings and actual payments varying from contractual terms  as well as other portfolio dynamics 
we periodically enter into structured financings involving the issuance of both debt and an interest rate swap with corresponding notional principal amount and maturity to manage liquidity and reduce interest rate risk at a lower overall funding cost than could be achieved by solely issuing debt 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes only  and do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate swaps are an effective means of achieving our target matched funding objectives by converting debt to the desired basis and duration 
as part of managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates  cit  as an end user  enters into various interest rate swap transactions in the over the counter markets  with other financial institutions acting as principal counterparties 
to ensure both appropriate use as a hedge and hedge accounting treatment under sfas  all derivatives entered into are designated according to a hedge objective against a specified liability  including long term debt and commercial paper or in limited instances against specific assets 
our primary hedge objectives include the conversion of variable rate liabilities to fixed rates  and the conversion of fixed rate liabilities to variable rates 
the notional amounts  rates  indices and maturities of derivatives are required to closely match the related terms of hedged items 
interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of billion at december   billion at december   billion at september  and billion at september  were designated as hedges against outstanding debt 
the net increase in notional principal amounts of interest rate swaps at december  compared to the prior year consisted of a  million increase in fixed to floating rate swaps fair value hedges and a million decrease in floating to fixed rate swaps cash flow hedges 
the increase in fixed to float swaps was primarily due to the fact that we elevated our fixed rate debt issuance during  as we extended our maturity profile in conjunction with spreads declining 
in addition  we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our securitization programs 
see note derivative financial instruments for further details 
the following table summarizes the composition of our assets and liabilities before and after swaps before swaps after swaps fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate december  assets liabilities december  assets liabilities a comparative analysis of the weighted average principal outstanding and interest rates on our debt before and after the effect of interest rate swaps is shown in the following table in millions

we regularly monitor and simulate our degree of interest rate sensitivity by measuring the repricing characteristics of interest sensitive assets  liabilities  and derivatives 
the capital committee reviews the results of this modeling periodically 
the interest rate sensitivity modeling techniques we employ include the creation of prospective twelve month baseline and rate shocked net interest income simulations 
at the date that interest rate sensitivity is modeled  baseline net interest income is derived considering the current level of interest sensitive assets and related run off including both contractual repayment and historical prepayment experience  the current level of interest sensitive liabilities and related maturities  and the current level of derivatives 
the baseline simulation assumes that  over the next successive twelve months  market interest rates as of the date of simulation are held constant and that no new loans or leases are extended 
once the baseline net interest income is calculated  market interest rates  which were previously held constant  are raised basis points instantaneously and parallel across the entire yield curve  and a rate shocked simulation is run 
interest rate sensitivity is then measured as the difference between calculated baseline and rate shocked net interest income 
an immediate hypothetical basis point parallel increase in the yield curve on january  would reduce net income by an estimated million after tax over the next twelve months 
a corresponding decrease in the yield curve would cause an increase in net income of a like amount 
a basis point increase in the yield curve on january  would have reduced net income by an estimated million after tax  while a corresponding decrease in the yield curve would have increased net income by a like amount 
although management believes that this measure provides a meaningful estimate of our interest rate sensitivity  it does not account for potential changes in the credit quality  size  composition and prepayment characteristics of the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net income 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated outcomes of our simulations 
further  such simulations do not represent management s current view of future market interest rate movements 
we also utilize foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge currency risk underlying our net investments in foreign operations and cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge both foreign currency and interest rate risk underlying foreign debt 
at december   cit was party to foreign currency exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling billion and maturities ranging from to and party to cross currency interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling billion and maturities ranging from to at december   cit was party to foreign currency exchange forward contracts with notional amounts totaling billion and party to cross currency interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling billion 
at september   cit was party to billion in notional principal amount of foreign currency exchange forward contracts and billion in notional principal amount of cross currency swaps 
translation gains and losses of the underlying foreign net investment  as well as offsetting derivative gains and losses on designated hedges  are reflected in other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet 
derivative risk management we enter into interest rate and currency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts as part of our overall market risk management practices 
we assess and manage the external and internal risks associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with the overall operating goals established by our capital committee 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk  legal risk and market risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of cit policy 
the primary external risk of derivative instruments is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
we control the credit risk of our derivative agreements through counterparty credit approvals  pre established exposure limits and monitoring procedures 
the capital committee  in conjunction with corporate risk management  approves each counterparty and establishes exposure limits based on credit analysis and market value 
all derivative agreements are entered into with major money center financial institutions rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of our counterparties rated aa or better 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
exposures are calculated for each derivative contract and are aggregated by counterparty to monitor credit exposure 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk refers to the risk of being unable to meet potential cash outflows promptly and cost effectively 
factors that could cause such a risk to arise might be a disruption of a securities market or other source of funds 
we actively manage and mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining diversified sources of funding and committed alternate sources of funding  and we maintain and periodically review a contingency funding plan to be implemented in the event of any form of market disruption 
the primary funding sources are commercial paper us  long term debt us and international and asset backed securities us and canada 
the commercial paper program closed the year at billion  versus billion at december  and billion at september  our targeted us program size remains at billion with modest programs aggregating million to be maintained in canada and australia 
our goal is to maintain committed bank lines in excess of aggregate outstanding commercial paper 
cit maintains registration statements with the securities and exchange commission sec covering debt securities that we may sell in the future 
at december   we had billion of registered  but unissued  debt securities available under a shelf registration statement 
term debt issued during the year ended december  consisted of billion in fixed rate notes and billion in variable rate notes 
in november  we introduced a retail note program in which we offer fixed rate senior  unsecured notes utilizing numerous broker dealers for placement to retail accounts 
during the year  we issued billion under this program having maturities of between and years 
as part of our strategy to further diversify our funding sources  billion of fixed rate foreign currency denominated debt was issued during the last quarter of we plan on utilizing these alternate sources of debt funding to meet our strategic growth initiatives 
to further strengthen our funding capabilities  we maintain committed asset backed facilities and shelf registration statements  which cover a range of assets from equipment to consumer home equity receivables and trade accounts receivable 
while these are predominately in the us  we also maintain facilities for canadian domiciled assets 
as of december   we had approximately billion of availability in our committed asset backed facilities  including billion relating to our trade receivable facility  and billion of registered  but unissued  securities available under public shelf registration statements relating to our asset backed securitization program 
our committed asset backed commercial paper programs in the us and canada provide a substantial source of alternate liquidity 
we also maintain committed bank lines of credit to provide backstop support of commercial paper borrowings and local bank lines to support our international operations 
additional sources of liquidity are loan and lease payments from customers  whole loan asset sales and loan syndications 
we also target and monitor certain liquidity metrics to ensure both a balanced liability profile and adequate alternate liquidity availability as outlined in the following table 
current december  december  liquidity measurement target commercial paper to total debt maximum of short term debt to total debt maximum of bank lines to short term debt minimum of aggregate alternate liquidity to short term debt minimum of aggregate alternative liquidity includes available bank facilities  asset backed conduit facilities and cash 
our credit ratings are an important factor in meeting our margin targets as better ratings generally correlate to lower cost of funds see net finance margin  interest expense discussion 
the following credit ratings have been in place since september  short term long term outlook moody s p a stable standard poor s a a stable fitch f a stable the credit ratings stated above are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we have certain covenants contained in our legal documents that govern our funding sources 
the most significant covenant in cit s indentures and credit agreements is a negative pledge provision  which limits granting or permitting liens on our assets  but provides for exceptions for certain ordinary course liens needed to operate our business 
in addition  our credit agreements also contain a minimum net worth test ranging from billion to billion

off balance sheet arrangements securitization program we fund asset originations on our balance sheet by accessing various sectors of the capital markets  including the term debt and commercial paper markets 
in an effort to broaden funding sources and provide an additional source of liquidity  we use an array of securitization programs  including both asset backed commercial paper and term structures  to access both the public and private asset backed securitization markets 
current products in these programs include receivables and leases secured by equipment as well as consumer loans secured by residential real estate 
the following table summarizes data relating to our securitization balance and activity in millions 
three months nine months year ended ended year ended ended december  december  september  september  securitized assets specialty finance commercial     specialty finance consumer     equipment finance     total securitized assets     securitized assets as a of managed assets volume securitized specialty finance commercial    specialty finance consumer  equipment finance    total volume securitized     with the restoration of our funding base and the strengthening of our credit spreads  securitization volume normalized during our securitization activity relating to commercial finance receivables was billion  as the economics remained favorable to complete these sales 
also  we decided to grow the consumer home equity portfolio on balance sheet during the second half of management targets a maximum of of pre tax income from securitization gains 
under our typical asset backed securitization  we sell a pool of secured loans or leases to a special purpose entity  typically a trust 
the special purpose entity  in turn  issues certificates and or notes that are collateralized by the pool and entitle the holders thereof to participate in certain pool cash flows 
we retain the servicing of the securitized contracts  for which we earn a servicing fee 
we also participate in certain residual cash flows cash flows after payment of principal and interest to certificate and or note holders  servicing fees and other credit related disbursements 
at the date of securitization  we estimate the residual cash flows to be received over the life of the securitization  record the present value of these cash flows as a retained interest in the securitization retained interests can include bonds issued by the special purpose entity  cash reserve accounts on deposit in the special purpose entity or interest only receivables and typically recognize a gain 
in estimating residual cash flows and the value of the retained interests  we make a variety of financial assumptions  including pool credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
these assumptions are supported by both our historical experience and anticipated trends relative to the particular products securitized 
subsequent to recording the retained interests  we review them quarterly for impairment based on estimated fair value 
these reviews are performed on a disaggregated basis 
fair values of retained interests are estimated utilizing current pool demographics  actual note certificate outstandings  current and anticipated credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
our retained interests had a carrying value at december  of  million  including interests in commercial securitized assets of  million and consumer securitized assets of million 
the total retained interest as of december  is comprised of million in over collateralization  million of interest only strips  and million of cash reserve accounts 
retained interests are subject to credit and prepayment risk 
as of december   approximately of our outstanding securitization pool balances are in conduit structures 
our interests relating to commercial securitized assets are generally subject to lower prepayment risk because of the contractual terms of the underlying receivables 
these assets are subject to the same credit granting and monitoring processes which are described in the credit risk management section 
securitization and joint venture activities we utilize special purpose entities spes and joint ventures in the normal course of business to execute securitization transactions and conduct business in key vendor relationships 
securitization transactions spes are used to achieve true sale requirements for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
pools of assets are originated or acquired and sold to spes  which in turn issue debt securities to investors solely backed by asset pools 
accordingly  cit has no legal obligations to repay the securities in the event of a default by the spe 
cit retains the servicing rights and participates in certain cash flows of the pools 
the present value of expected net cash flows that exceeds the estimated cost of servicing is recorded in other assets as a retained interest 
assets securitized are shown in our managed assets and our capitalization ratios on a managed basis 
under the recently issued rules relating to consolidation and spes  non qualifying securitization entities have to be consolidated 
we believe that all of our existing asset backed spe structures meet the definition of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe as defined by sfas no 
and therefore will continue to qualify as off balance sheet transactions 
as part of these related activities  cit entered into billion in notional amount of hedge transactions to protect the related trusts against interest rate risk 
cit is insulated from this risk by entering into offsetting swap transactions with third parties totalling billion in notional amount at december  during  we successfully completed a consent solicitation to amend the negative pledge provision in our debt indenture 
this action conforms the debt indenture to our other agreements and provides flexibility in structuring our securitizations as accounting sales or secured financings 
joint ventures we utilize joint ventures organized through distinct legal entities to conduct financing activities with certain strategic vendor partners 
receivables are originated by the joint venture and purchased by cit 
the vendor partner and cit jointly own these distinct legal entities  and there is no third party debt involved 
these arrangements are accounted for using the equity method  with profits and losses distributed according to the joint venture agreement
