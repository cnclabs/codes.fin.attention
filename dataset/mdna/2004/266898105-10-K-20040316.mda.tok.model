item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview dusa is a pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the research  development  and marketing of a drug named aminolevulinic acid  or ala  used in combination with appropriate light devices in order to detect or treat a variety of medical conditions 
the trademark for our brand of ala is levulan r 
when levulan r is used and followed with exposure to light to produce a therapeutic effect  the technology is called photodynamic therapy  or pdt 
when levulan r is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  the technology is called photodetection  or pd 
our products  which were launched in september in the united states  are levulan r topical solution using our kerastick r brand applicator  and our blu u r brand light unit 
our products are used together to provide pdt for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp 
in addition  we received market clearance from the fda in september to market the blu u r without levulan r for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris 
we have primarily devoted our resources to fund research and development in order to advance the levulan r pdt pd technology platform and  as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  and our ability to develop new products 
during  we implemented our new sales  marketing  physician education  and development strategies following the reacquisition of our rights from our former marketing partner in september the october  launch of dusa s initial sales force and related marketing and sales activities has resulted in significant additional expenses 
however  the impact on sales was positive 
kerastick r unit sales to end users were  for  as compared to  for  with fourth quarter sales totaling  as compared to  in the fourth quarter although the costs related to the addition of our sales force and related marketing activities are currently greater than the gross profit generated from the increased sales  we are encouraged with the initial increase in sales  and will continue our efforts to penetrate the market 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses until sales of our products increase substantially 
see section entitled results of operations marketing and sales costs 
at this time  our core objectives include focusing on increasing sales in the united states  conducting clinical trials which  if successful  could lead to additional dermatology indications  and seeking a partner to help develop and market levulan r pdt for the treatment of dysplasia in patients with barrett s esophagus 
in addition  we continue to support independent investigator trials to advance research in the use and applicability of levulan r pdt for other indications in dermatology 
we have continued to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
such efforts included working with the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to reverse the bundling of the drug cost with the procedure fee  which had occurred effective march  in november  cms agreed to reinstate the code for physicians to bill the drug cost separate from the procedure fee 
as a result  effective january   there is a separate code for the costs of the levulan r kerastick r  and a revised reimbursement code for the blu u r application procedure 
doctors can also bill for any applicable visit fees 
however  some physicians have suggested that even the new reimbursement levels do not fully reflect the required efforts to routinely employ our therapy in their practices 
these issues have affected the economic competitiveness of our products with other ak therapies and hence have hindered the adoption of our therapy 
in addition  we continue to work to educate the major private insurance carriers such that they will approve our therapy for coverage 
as of december   several major private insurers have approved coverage for our ak therapy 
we believe that due to these efforts  along with our education and marketing programs  more widespread adoption by the medical community should occur over time 
in addition  we are aware that some physicians have been using levulan r with light devices manufactured by other companies and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  these activities could also positively affect the use of our products 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our therapy  but recognize that we have to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
we also recognize that market acceptance has taken longer than we originally anticipated  and that product sales have not reached the levels that were originally expected 
while our financial position is strong  we cannot predict when product sales may offset the costs associated with these efforts 
as of december   we had a staff of full time employees and part time employee  as compared to full time employees at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
recent events february private placement on february   dusa entered into definitive agreements with certain new and existing institutional and other accredited investors for the private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in gross proceeds to dusa of  dusa has granted the investors the right to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
these additional investment rights expire april   or trading days from closing  which occurred on march  the placement agent s commission and non refundable retainer was paid in  shares of common stock calculated at the offering price 
dusa will use the proceeds from the sale of the securities to expand our sales force and for general working capital purposes  including research and development activities 
re acquisition of canadian product rights on february   dusa reacquired the rights to the aminolevulinic acid levulan r technology for canada held by draxis health inc draxis 
these rights were initially assigned to draxis in at the time of the original licensing of the patents underlying our levulan r pdt platform from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario 
dusa and draxis terminated the assignment and dusa agreed to pay to draxis an upfront fee and a royalty on sales of the levulan r kerastick r in canada over a five year term 
the commercial launch of our products in canada is expected to occur in manufacturing facility approval on july   dusa received fda approval to manufacture the levulan r kerastick r at our wilmington facility  and in february we commenced manufacturing kerastick r units in support of our plan to maintain an adequate supply of inventory to meet market demand for our products based on sales projections 
as of december   we had  kerastick r units in inventory 
this inventory was produced in by our former third party manufacturer to meet product demand during the execution of our project to complete construction and gain fda approval of our new manufacturing facility 
the facility will also be utilized in to produce clinical supplies for our planned dusa sponsored studies in addition to investigator studies which dusa plans to support 
third party distribution agreement effective december   dusa amended its agreement with moore medical corporation moore  a national distributor and marketer of medical and surgical supplies  to eliminate moore s exclusivity rights and allow dusa to use other third party distributors of the kerastick r in the united states 
since that time  two additional distributors have been appointed 
in addition  distributors have also been authorized to sell the blu u r on dusa s behalf 
distributors have the right to return their inventory of kerastick r units for full credit for a period of time prior to and after the expiration date of their respective agreements 
k fda filing on september   dusa received market clearance from the fda to market the blu u r without levulan r for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris 
we initiated the marketing of the blu u r for this indication in the fourth quarter of although direct sales of blu u r commenced in november  the overall impact that selling the blu u r for the treatment of acne will have on product sales is uncertain at this time 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is reasonableness of collection 
research revenue previously earned under our collaborative agreement consisted of non refundable research and development funding from our former dermatology collaboration partner 
research revenue generally compensated us for a portion of our agreed upon research and development expenses and was recognized as revenue at the time the research and development activities were performed under the terms of the related agreements and when no future performance obligations existed 
milestone or other up front payments are typically recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as earned  generally on a straight line basis over the term of an agreement 
under the terms of our former dermatology collaboration agreement  we initially estimated a year life  the term of the agreement 
as a result of the termination of that agreement in  the estimated period over which we were recognizing revenue ceased and the unamortized deferred revenue of  was accelerated 
since the termination of the former collaboration agreement  we have been selling our products through distributors who have a general right of return of product and  accordingly  we have deferred such revenue until the product is sold by our distributors to the end user 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  significant unanticipated changes in our estimates due to business  economic  or industry events could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab clarifies existing guidance regarding revenues for contracts which contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with emerging issues task force eitf no 
the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
for example  as a result of the termination of the former dermatology collaboration agreement in  we recorded lower of cost or market adjustments of  for excess inventory and commercial light units at that time 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory that should remain on the consolidated balance sheet 
management believes that the recorded inventory value is reasonable in light of our current sales forecasts 
should we be unable to achieve the forecasted sales  additional adjustments may be recorded to cost of goods sold 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
in and again in  we concluded that the termination of our former dermatology collaboration agreement in september and current business events have not caused any impairment to our manufacturing facility 
at december   total property  plant and equipment had a carrying value of  including our manufacturing facility which received fda approval on july  in september  as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration agreement  we recorded impairment adjustments of  related to certain intangibles assets previously recorded in our financial statements 
we had no intangible assets recorded as of december  or stock based compensation we have elected to continue to use the intrinsic value based method to account for employee stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 and to provide disclosures based on the fair value method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees is accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period which  in the case of stock options  is generally the vesting period 
as we utilize stock and stock options as one means of compensating employees  consultants  and others  a change in accounting for stock based compensation could  under certain circumstances  result in an adverse material effect on our results of operations  but would not affect cash flows 
results of operations dermatology collaboration termination on september   dusa and schering ag  the company s former marketing and development partner for levulan r pdt in the field of dermatology  terminated the parties marketing development and supply agreement  dated november  as a result of this termination  dusa reacquired all rights it granted to schering ag under the agreement  and evaluated certain items on its consolidated balance sheet for the timing of revenue recognition and potential impairment 
these items included unamortized deferred revenue related to non refundable milestone payments previously received under the agreement with schering ag  and assets including our manufacturing facility  raw material and finished goods inventories  commercial light units  and deferred charges and royalties 
as a result of this analysis  in addition to normal amortization recorded prior to the termination of the schering ag agreement  dusa recorded the following items in its consolidated statements of operations during september revenue recognition statement of operations item balance sheet item asset impairment revenues research grant and milestone revenue deferred revenue  operating costs cost of product sales deferred charges  inventory  commercial light sources under lease or rental  total cost of product sales  research and development costs deferred royalty  total operating cost charges  in  dusa accelerated the recognition of  of unamortized research grant and milestone revenue  which was previously recorded as deferred revenue 
in  dusa charged i  to cost of product sales and royalties for deferred charges associated with its amended supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan r  ii  to cost of product sales and royalties for deferred charges associated with underutilization costs paid to national biological corporation nbc  the manufacturer of our blu u r  and iii  to research and development costs for deferred royalties associated with payments to parteq  the company s licensor 
these amounts represented the unamortized balances of previously deferred costs which were being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
in  dusa recorded lower of cost or market adjustments for estimated excess blu u r inventory of  and  for bulk levulan r based on i the termination of the company s former dermatology collaboration arrangement  ii limited product sales since the september product launch  and iii the company s expectations at that time of no significant near term increases in kerastick r sales levels and or blu u r placements 
in  dusa recorded an additional  of depreciation expense reflecting a shortened useful life of our blu u r units under lease  rental  or trial arrangements to reflect a three year asset life 
this accelerated depreciation policy was attributable to the low level of blu u r placements at the date of the termination of the collaboration arrangement  and management s expectations at that time that near term placements would be limited 
year ending december  as compared to revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in revenues for included research grant and milestone revenues of  comprised of the one time recognition in september of unamortized up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments previously received from schering ag totaling  due to the termination of this relationship  and normal amortization of  earned prior to the termination 
see section entitled results of operations dermatology collaboration termination 
revenues for also included  of research and development reimbursement which we earned from our former marketing partner 
due to the termination of this agreement  we have not received any co development revenue from schering ag subsequent to total product sales and rental income for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively  and comprised of the following year ended december  increase decrease kerastick r product sales    blu u r product sales   blu u r rental and other sales   royalty revenues   total product sales and rental income    product sales for included royalty revenues of  which we previously earned for kerastick r sales by berlex  the subsidiary of our former marketing partner  to its distributor 
the increase in kerastick r product sales revenue is due in part to dusa s receipt of of revenues on units sold to end users  primarily through its distributors  as compared to approximately of the net sales that we received as a royalty under our former collaboration agreement during revenues for also included blu u r product sales of  after receiving fda clearance to market the blu u r as a stand alone device for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris 
as of december   blu u r units were in place in physicians offices  up from units at december  this increase in blu u r placements included the sale of units following receipt of market clearance from the fda in september for acne 
kerastick r sales to end users were  for  as compared to  for although the level of kerastick r sales to end users for is higher than those in the prior year  kerastick r sales must continue to increase significantly to offset the increased costs incurred for marketing and sales activities 
see results of operations marketing and sales costs 
cost of product sales and royalties cost of product sales and royalties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the components of cost of product sales and royalties for the years ended december  and  including direct and indirect costs to support our product is provided below year ended december  increase decrease cost of product sales and royalties product costs including internal costs eg customer service  quality assurance  purchasing  depreciation  amortization and other product support operations assigned to support products    direct kerastick r product costs    costs incurred to ship  install and service the blu u r in physicians offices    royalty and supply fees    net underutilization costs   deferred charges amortization   inventory and deferred charge adjustments resulting from collaboration termination   total cost of product sales and royalties    the increase in product costs for is primarily attributable to increased costs to support the preparation to manufacture the kerastick r  including the submission of an nda supplement to the fda for our manufacturing facility  facility depreciation and overhead allocations 
although there were direct blu u r product sales in  there were no related direct blu u r product costs in as these had a zero book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during based on i the termination of the company s former dermatology collaboration arrangement  ii limited product sales since the september product launch  and iii the company s expectation at that time of no significant near term increases in kerastick r sales levels and or blu u r placements 
royalty and supply fees are paid to our licensor  parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario 
underutilization costs commenced in and were fully amortized as of december  based on agreements with our third party manufacturers due to orders falling below certain previously anticipated levels 
deferred charges amortization reflects consideration paid by us in to amend our supply agreement with sochinaz sa  the manufacturer of the bulk drug ingredient used in levulan r 
such deferred charges were fully amortized in see section entitled results of operations dermatology collaboration termination 
research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the overall lower level of research and development costs in is attributable  in part  to the absence of co sponsored project costs that were agreed to under the collaboration termination in  of which approximately two thirds  or  were previously reimbursed to us by our former marketing partner 
co sponsored projects included phase i ii studies using levulan r pdt in the treatment of persistent plantar warts and onychomycosis nail fungus 
these projects have been put on hold as we concentrate on increasing sales  and implementing a new dermatology development program focused on indications that use our approved kerastick r 
based on market research that was completed earlier in  we decided to move forward with phase ii studies for use of levulan r pdt in photodamaged skin and acne rather than pursuing a broad area actinic keratoses treatment  as we do not believe the former indication would have a major impact on sales 
in  we also received market clearance from the fda on a section k premarket notification application for use of the blu u r without levulan r to treat moderate inflammatory acne 
this year s development program included the completion of an fda mandated phase iv long term ak tracking study  which was completed at the end of  with the final report submitted to the fda in january dusa is also funding various investigator studies involving ala and or the kerastick r 
the decrease in research and development costs in is also attributable to the assignment of personnel and related costs to marketing and sales functions as of january  that were previously functioning in research and development roles  which totaled  in in addition  costs incurred in included the write off of  of previously deferred royalties associated with payments to parteq  our licensor  and a  milestone payment under our license agreement signed in december between dusa and photonamic gmbh co 
kg  a subsidiary of medac gmbh  a german pharmaceutical company 
in addition  we may also be obligated to pay certain regulatory milestones of  upon fda acceptance of a registration application for a brain cancer product in the united states  and an additional  upon registration of the product and royalties of on net sales under the terms of the license and development agreement 
this agreement also grants a license of photonamic s proprietary technology related to ala in the field of brain cancer 
research and development costs for also included higher third party expenditures in support of our fda mandated phase iv clinical study of the long term efficacy of our marketed product  clinical feasibility studies in other dermatological indications  and our phase i ii clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of levulan r pdt treatment of barrett s esophagus with and without dysplasia 
we have also been conducting phase i ii studies in the treatment of high grade and low grade dysplasia associated with barrett s esophagus 
results of the high grade dysplasia hgd study as of january  with twelve months of follow up data in four patients  and six months in one patient  showed a continued complete ablation of hgd 
the treatment has been well tolerated  with no occurrence of strictures circumferential scarring  and no signs of mucosal overgrowth 
in addition  in preparation for a phase ii clinical trial  we are planning to carry out a small single center pilot phase ii clinical trial using dusa s new proprietary endoscopic light delivery device for the treatment of hgd 
however  currently  we do not plan to fund other phase ii or iii clinical trials for this indication on our own 
therefore  we are seeking a strategic partner to join in the development  marketing  and distribution of our treatment for barrett s esophagus dysplasia 
while our original goal had been to complete a partnership agreement during  we did not have a partnership in place at the end of there can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any collaboration on terms acceptable to us 
we expect research and development costs to increase to approximately  to  during due primarily to initiating our planned phase ii clinical studies relating to photodamaged skin and moderate to severe acne 
final cost estimates on these phase ii studies are in process as we are working with the fda to determine the necessary protocols 
marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for were  comprised of  in payroll related costs  including direct and indirect commissions  with the remaining balance in support of such efforts 
in the prior year  there were no marketing and sales expenses incurred directly by us as all rights and activities associated with marketing and sales of our products were the sole responsibility of our former partner 
in late  following the termination of our collaboration with our former marketing partner  we commenced marketing initiatives associated with having full rights and responsibilities for our products 
in addition  as of january   we reassigned resources that were functioning in research and development roles to our marketing and sales function 
in august  dusa hired an associate vice president of sales  and in october we hired  trained  and deployed a regional sales force  which was initially comprised of six direct representatives  various independent representatives  and an independent sales distributor  to focus on most of our key geographic markets in the united states 
at the end of december  we hired our seventh direct representative in a key target market  and in january  we continued to expand our sales capacity by adding one more direct representative and an independent representative in another key target market 
we anticipate that the level of marketing and sales expenses and related support functions will continue to increase in as we seek to expand our sales capacity as a result of the initial success of our sales initiatives 
general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for this increase is mainly attributable to higher legal expenses incurred in of  as compared to  in  due primarily to patent defense costs 
it is expected that legal expenses will remain at elevated levels as long as the patent dispute continues 
these increased legal expenses were offset  in part  by lower staffing related costs of approximately  in  due primarily to employee separations during in april  we received a copy of a notice issued by photocure asa to queen s university at kingston  ontario  alleging that australian patent no 
 which is one of the patents licensed by parteq to us  relating to ala technology  is invalid 
as a consequence of this action  queen s university has assigned the australian patent to us so that we may participate directly in this litigation 
we have filed an answer setting forth our defenses and a related countersuit alleging that certain activities of photocure and its marketing partner  galderma s 
a  infringe the patent 
the case is ongoing and we are unable to predict the outcome at this time 
dusa believes that the final hearing in the federal court of australia will occur in april in december  the company was served with a complaint filed in the state of michigan circuit court for the county of oakland alleging that dusa s blu u r caused the plaintiff to suffer a seizure during the performance of her duties as an office assistant 
the complaint names berlex laboratories  inc  a subsidiary of our former marketing partner  as another defendant 
the damages are unspecified 
the case has been removed to the us district court  eastern district of michigan  southern division 
while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this action  the company believes that the costs associated with all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to the consolidated results of operations in any one period to the extent costs are not covered by dusa s insurance 
other income  net other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflects lower levels of investable cash balances as we used cash to support our operating activities  and a decline in yields 
with the addition of the proceeds from the private placement in march  interest income will initially increase and then may decline  dependent on interest rates  as our investable cash balances are used to support our operating activities 
in addition  other income in included  of gains on the sale of securities to meet planned cash operating requirements 
there were no such sales of securities in during and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively  on borrowings associated with the construction of our new kerastick r manufacturing facility 
of these amounts   and  has been currently capitalized in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet in and  respectively 
income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  although we had net income for  there was no income tax expense because the majority of the revenue we recognized in connection with the termination of the schering ag agreement had been taxable in prior years for income tax purposes 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at december  and net income loss for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of  or per share  as compared to net income of  or per share  for the year ended as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  net income for included a one time increase of approximately  excluding normal amortization recorded prior to termination  based on the acceleration of previously deferred revenue and costs  and other related adjustments for impairment 
see section entitled results of operations dermatology collaboration termination 
this one time recognition resulted in an increase to earnings per share of for the period 
net losses are expected to be incurred until the successful market penetration of our products occurs 
such losses are expected to continue until end user sales offset the cost of launching our sales force  marketing initiatives  and costs for other business support functions 
year ending december  as compared to revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in research grant and milestone revenues were  in  as compared to  in  and included the one time recognition in of unamortized up front milestone and unrestricted grant payments previously received from schering ag totaling  due to the termination of this relationship in september  and normal amortization of  received prior to the termination

at december   we had approximately  of cash resources comprised of  of cash and cash equivalents  united states government securities of  and restricted cash of  all of our united states government securities are classified as available for sale 
as of december   these securities had yields ranging from to and maturity dates ranging from january  to september  on february   dusa completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in gross proceeds of  dusa also granted the investors the right to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional  shares of common stock at per share 
these additional investment rights expire trading days from closing  which occurred on march  as of december   our working capital total current assets minus total current liabilities was  as compared to  as of december  total current assets decreased  in due primarily to a decline in cash  cash equivalents  and united states government securities of  as we use cash to support our operating activities 
total current liabilities decreased  in due primarily to a decline in other accrued expenses of  as higher accruals for research and development costs  product related costs and license milestone were paid in  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts payable  accrued payroll  and deferred revenue on kerastick r units due to growth in operations and sales  including an increase in personnel 
during  we used  of cash for operating activities  incurred property  plant  and equipment additions of  and received  of net proceeds from maturations of united states government securities 
during  we also made payments on long term debt of  while receiving  in proceeds from stock option exercises 
during the comparable period  we used  of cash for operating activities  purchased  of property and equipment primarily attributable to the construction of our manufacturing facility  and received net proceeds of  from maturations and purchases of united states government securities 
during  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately  which includes upgrades to our computer systems and website  and marketing fixtures  as well as other purchases to support the growth in our business 
in may  we also received  under a secured term loan promissory note note with citizens bank of massachusetts to fund the construction of our manufacturing facility and made payments on the note of  during as of december   the total outstanding loan balance was  of which  is current 
approximately  of the company s united states government securities are pledged as collateral to secure the loan 
prior to expiration of the day libor based rate for each year of the loan  we can either continue to choose a libor based rate at that time  execute a one time conversion to a fixed rate loan  or repay the loan balance 
the current interest rate on the note is based on the annual renewal on june  as this rate was lower than the yield being generated by each of our united states government securities at that time  we decided not to repay the loan 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current programs for levulan r pdt  and to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we have ready access to these cash reserves  as needed  for the funding of development plans on a short term and long term basis 
as a result of the termination of our former dermatology collaboration arrangement  we evaluated our operations during and minimized research and development and related general and administrative expenditures while we concentrated on implementing new sales  marketing  physician education  and development strategies 
such strategies included the hiring of an associate vice president of sales in august followed by the october launch of dusa s initial sales force  and participation in various medical education events 
we anticipate that the level of marketing and sales expenses and related support functions will increase in as we seek to expand our sales capacity as a result of the initial success of our sales initiatives 
we may also seek to expand or enhance our business by using resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  new technologies  or products  especially in pdt related areas 
for  we are focusing primarily on increasing the sales of the levulan r kerastick r and the blu u r  initiating phase ii studies for use of levulan r pdt in photodamaged skin and acne using our kerastick r  and on seeking a partner to help develop and market levulan r pdt for the treatment of dysplasia in patients with barrett s esophagus 
full development and testing of all potential indications would require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including o the level of sales of our products including the success of our marketing programs since reacquiring the rights to the dermatological uses of levulan r pdt  o progress of our research and development programs  o the results of preclinical and clinical trials  o the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  o competitive developments  o the results of patent disputes  o any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and o the availability of other financing 
we cannot accurately predict the level of revenues from sales of our products 
in order to maintain and continue to expand our sales and marketing endeavors  and to initiate our planned research and development programs  we may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of sales we receive 
the total capital costs used to develop our manufacturing facility  which was approved to manufacture the levulan r kerastick r by the fda in july  was approximately  including equipment 
we have also incurred certain environmental control costs as part of our development of a production line for kerastick r manufacturing to ensure that our facility complies with environmental standards 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future  or any assurance that our operations  business or assets will not be materially adversely affected by current or future environmental laws or regulations 
see section entitled business government regulation 
dusa has no off sheet balance sheet financing arrangements other than its operating leases 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments to make future payments under contracts  including lease agreements  research and development contracts  manufacturing contracts  or other related agreements  are as follows at december  obligations due by period year or after total less years years years operating lease obligations      research and development projects    secured term loan promissory note      research and development projects include various commitments including initial obligations for our planned phase ii clinical studies for photodamaged skin and moderate to severe acne 
final cost estimates on these phase ii studies are in process as we are working with the fda to determine the necessary protocols 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we have contracted with therapeutics  inc  a clinical research organization  to manage the clinical development of our products in the field of dermatology 
this organization has the opportunity for additional stock grants  bonuses  and other incentives for each product indication ranging from  to  depending on the regulatory phase of development of products under therapeutics management 
recently issued accounting guidance in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which was amended by fin r issued in december this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies that either do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or for which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest 
this interpretation applies immediately to vies created after january  it also applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march   to vies created before february  in which an enterprise holds a variable interest 
fin requires disclosure of vies in financial statements issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing vie that will require consolidation or  the company will hold a significant variable interest in  or have significant involvement with  an existing vie 
dusa has adopted this statement which had no effect on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold fixed income united states government securities that are subject to interest rate market risks 
however  we do not believe that the risk is material as we make our investments in relatively short term instruments and we strive to match the maturity dates of these instruments to our cash flow needs 
a decline in the average yield of these instruments would reduce interest income by approximately  based on our december  balance in us government securities 
we currently have exposure to interest rate risk under a secured term loan promissory note which we issued to fund the construction of our manufacturing facility 
interest on this loan is at a libor based rate  and calls for an annual renewal on june th of each year through june  to either the applicable libor based rate or a one time conversion to a fixed rate loan 
the current loan rate of is based on a libor based rate plus basis points at the time of renewal libor is at december  
our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material
