the segment faces competitive price pressure from competitors on a worldwide basis 
the efficient manufacture of the segment s products is critical to ensuring that the company can be competitive with its selling prices 
there are three manufacturing plants in the united states  one in canada and one in brazil that are focused on continuous cost improvement 
timely capital investment into these plants for capacity and cost reductions  as well as securing critical raw material sourcing and pricing  are required to remain competitive 
the lawnmower segment represented of the company s sales in this segment manufactures and markets riding lawnmowers and related accessories under the dixon brand name

the segment s customer base is concentrated in the southeastern united states with international sales amounting to of segment sales in the performance of ipeg is aligned with overall trends in the forestry industry  including the import export balance of wood products  the utilization of lumber and paper mill capacity in the united states  and the level of logging production 
the cyclical nature of the forestry industry can significantly impact the operating income and cash flow of ipeg from year to year 
to react to such trends  the segment must consistently manage its four manufacturing plants on a lean page basis  tightly control the discounting of its products and maximize working capital turns 
the company maintains a small corporate staff at its headquarters located in portland oregon

in order to conserve cash  the company places a high priority in minimizing working capital  appropriately allocating capital spending to higher return projects and leveraging existing assets for additional product throughput 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and consistent with industry practice 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company records reductions to selling prices as products are shipped 
these reductions are based on competitive and market conditions  in addition to specific customer contracts in some instances 
these reductions are estimated and recorded at the time of shipment either through a reduction to invoice or the establishment of an accrual for payment at a later date 
the amount accrued may increase or decrease prior to payment due to customer performance and market conditions 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments 
such allowance is based on an ongoing review of customer payments against terms and a review of customers financial statements and conditions through monitoring services 
based on these reviews  additional allowances may be required and are recorded in the appropriate period 
specific industry market conditions can significantly increase or decrease the level of inventory on hand in any of the company s business units 
the company will adjust for changes in demand by reducing or increasing production levels 
the company estimates the required inventory reserve by assessing inventory turns and market selling prices on a product by product basis 
the company will maintain such reserves until product is sold or market conditions require an increase in the reserves 
the company offers certain warranties with the sale of its products 
the warranty obligation is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet and is estimated through historical customer claims  supplier performance  and new product performance 
should a change in trend occur in customer claims  an increase or decrease in the warranty liability may be necessary 
the company incurs expenses on account of product liability claims as a result of alleged product malfunctions or defects 
the company maintains insurance for a portion of this exposure and records a liability for its non insured obligations 
the company estimates its product liability obligations on a case by case basis in page addition to a review of product performance trends 
these estimated obligations may be increased or decreased as more information on specific cases becomes available 
the company determines its post retirement obligations on an actuarial basis that requires management to make certain assumptions 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate to be used in calculating the applicable benefit obligation and the anticipated trend in health care costs 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and consideration is given to market conditions as well as the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and no 
 employers accounting for post retirement costs other than pensions 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was for and the company anticipates the same rate to be utilized in the company believes this rate is reasonable given the asset composition and historical trends 
the company lowered its discount rate assumption to to determine its plan liabilities at december  from in the previous year due to the market declines in benchmark interest rates 
the company assumed that health care costs in would increase by per year and future increases would decline by per year until is reached 
the company s annual post retirement expenses can be impacted by changes in assumptions 
a change in the return on assets will change annual pension expense by million 
a change in the discount rate as of december  results in million in increased pension expenses in and a change in health care costs will change annual post retirement medical costs by million a year 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
the company currently maintains a deferred tax asset valuation allowance
