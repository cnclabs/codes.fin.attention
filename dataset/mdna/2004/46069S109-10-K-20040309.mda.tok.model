overview we are a global designer and manufacturer of high performance analog integrated circuits 
we believe our product portfolio addresses some of the fastest growing applications within four attractive end markets high end consumer  computing  communications and industrial 
basis of presentation on march   we sold the assets of our discrete power products group to fairchild semiconductor corporation fairchild for million in cash and the assumption by fairchild of certain liabilities of the product group 
the consolidated balance sheet as of december  has been reduced by the assets purchased and liabilities assumed by fairchild 
additionally  the operating results of our discrete power products group are shown within continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
on may   we consummated the merger with elantec 
the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of elantec have been included in the accompanying financial schedules since the merger date 
on july   we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our wireless networking product group to globespanvirata  inc globespanvirata 
the wireless networking product group provides complete silicon  software and reference design solutions that meet the ieee s standards 
the sale was consummated on august  we received million in cash and approximately million in globespanvirata stock 
we also retained the accounts receivable and accounts payable of the product group in place at the time of sale 
the following results and discussion of the results of operations reflect reclassifications for discontinued operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas on december  in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted on december  under these new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets beginning december  included in the above is assembled workforce  which under sfas  is defined as an indefinite lived asset 

table of contents fiscal year compared with fiscal year the following table sets forth statement of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated year ended year ended january  january  january  january  in thousands revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales a research and development b selling  general and administrative b amortization of intangibles amortization of unearned compensation in process research and development impairment of long lived assets restructuring operating income loss interest income  net gain loss on investments gain on sale of certain operations income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations income taxes from discontinued operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income loss note percentages may not add due to rounding 
a cost of product sales includes the following unearned compensation b unearned compensation is excluded from the following research and development selling  general and administrative revenue revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year increased to million from million during fiscal year increased demand for desktop and notebook power management  optical storage and dsl products increased revenue by million 
in addition  fiscal year contained a full year of elantec revenues and fiscal year contained approximately six months of such revenues 
this resulted in an additional million in revenue for fiscal year we also changed our revenue recognition for north american distribution in fiscal year  which caused revenues to be higher in fiscal year by million 
these increases were offset by a million decline in automotive related products as a result of our exit of that product group 
geographically   and of product sales were derived from asia pacific  north america and europe  respectively  during fiscal year compared to  and during fiscal year the increase in the percentage of revenue generated from asia pacific in over is primarily due to the acquisition of elantec  which shipped approximately of its products to japan during fiscal year we ship our products to a variety of countries in descending order by volume including the united states  china  taiwan  japan  germany  singapore  korea  thailand  united kingdom and malaysia as well as others with less volume 
the united states comprised approximately of the shipments  followed by china with and taiwan with during fiscal year significant customers in the united states include two of our major distributors  who accounted for and of our revenues in the region  respectively 
also  during fiscal year  we made significant sales to one distributor that supports customers in taiwan and china 
this distributor comprised approximately of our sales to taiwan and of our sales to china 

table of contents gross profit cost of product sales consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with product manufacturing  plus licensing and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
in fiscal year  gross profit from continuing operations increased or million to million from million in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross margin from continuing operations was during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year  a percentage point improvement 
the primary driver of the increase  was growth in revenue  which increased gross profit by million 
in addition  the full year of elantec increased gross profit by million 
the closure of our findlay facility in mid  improved gross profit by approximately million 
we also changed our revenue recognition policy during fiscal year due to changes in our ability to estimate product returns 
since this change was not repeated in fiscal year  gross profit improved by million 
the exit of our lower margin automotive products group decreased gross profit by million 
approximately one third of our wafer manufacturing is performed by third party foundries 
we continue to analyze our mix of internal versus external manufacturing and any decision to increase our volume at third party foundries could have an affect on the carrying value of our internal fabrication equipment 
research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and costs of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
r d expenses from continuing operations increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the full year impact of the acquisition of elantec contributed approximately million in additional spending during the first four and one half months of fiscal year also we increased overall r d expenditures primarily on payroll  which contributed to a record year for new product introductions in versus in selling  general and administrative sg a sg a costs  which include marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses  from continuing operations was relatively flat with expenses of million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal year however  as a percentage of sales  sg a costs decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to workforce reduction actions taken during and specifically  we expect to see annual savings of million  million and million in future periods for actions taken for the integration of elantec second quarter  a workforce reduction first quarter and the wireless networking product group divestiture third quarter  respectively 
these savings were partially offset by the full year effects of the sg a costs for elantec  which contributed approximately million in increased spending 
amortization amortization of intangible assets from continuing operations decreased to million during the fiscal year from million during fiscal year definite lived assets are being amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
currently  fas requires testing goodwill for impairment at least annually while checking for impairment indicators quarterly 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of each of our reporting units exceeded its book value 
therefore  no impairments were taken 
depending on the future market demand for our products  among other factors  we could experience an impairment on this balance 
unearned compensation amortization of unearned compensation from continuing operations decreased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year this decrease is the result of the winding down of unearned compensation resulting from the elantec merger 
impairment of long lived assets during fiscal year  we recorded two impairments totaling million 
the first impairment of million million net of tax related to the property  plant and equipment within the findlay  ohio manufacturing facility 
the write down reduced the carrying value of the assets to their fair value  which was based on the contractual sales price of the assets in accordance with sfas prior to this impairment  the carrying value of the findlay assets was million 
as these assets were held and used until their disposal  we continued depreciation over their remaining useful lives 
the remaining million million net of tax impairment is primarily related to the adjustment of idle equipment to their fair value based on estimated future cash flows from these assets in accordance with sfas 
table of contents we recorded an impairment of long lived assets of million million net of tax during fiscal year this primarily consisted of a million million net of tax write down of certain definite lived intangible assets  which were tested for impairment following the sale of our wireless networking product group 
specifically  we impaired a portion of its customer base and developed technology balances that resulted from the purchase of the net assets of harris corporation s semiconductor business 
the impairments were measured as the excess of the assets carrying value over the assets fair value as determined by the present value of cash flows arising from the assets in accordance with sfas also included in the aforementioned million impairment was a million impairment million after tax related to the write off of a prepaid royalty for which we were not going to incorporate the related technology into our products 
in accordance with sfas  the write off reduced the value of the prepaid to zero as we did not expect to realize any future benefit from the asset 
gain loss on investments during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million after tax from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc the gain was calculated as the excess of the proceeds from disposition of the investment over its carrying value 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an investment  which is accounted for under the cost method of accounting since we hold less than ownership and can not exercise influence over the investee 
the impairment reflects the excess of the investment s carrying value over the estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from the eventual disposal of the securities 
the impairment was a result of a significant reorganization at the investee  which we believe  substantially eliminated their chances of making a profit in the future 
during fiscal year  we recognized a million gain million after tax from the sale of all shares of globespanvirata common stock received as part of the sale  shares 
the gain was calculated as the net proceeds from the sale less the carrying value of the stock  which was determined as the fair market value during the five day period including the date of the transaction and the two days preceding and succeeding this date 
the globespanvirata common stock represented a portion of the consideration paid to us by globespanvirata in connection with the sale of our wireless networking product group 
during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million after tax from the collection of previously escrowed funds resulting from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc in june the entire escrow receipt was recorded as a gain as the investment had no carrying value 
marketable securities consist of shares of chippac  inc chippac common stock that have been classified as investments on the balance sheet 
they are recorded at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices 
as of january  we carried an unrealized gain on the investment of million  before taxes 
we held  shares  or approximately of total chippac shares outstanding  at january  in process research and development in connection with our merger with elantec in may  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the merger  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a charge to income in fiscal year 
table of contents in making the purchase price allocation  our management relied on present value calculations of income  an analysis of project accomplishments and completion costs and an assessment of overall contribution and project risk 
the present value was determined by discounting to years of after tax cash flow projections depending on the individual project 
we used a discount rate of based on an approximation of the cost of capital 
the percentage of completion for the projects ranges from to  and the total cost to complete all projects at the time of the acquisition was approximately million 
the various project groupings  the cost to complete the projects and the average percentage complete within each grouping as of january  are set forth in the table below in millions project group number of projects cost to complete average percent complete value assigned to project optical storage communications dc dc converters amplifiers and comparators other video tft buffers total although these estimates were developed with the assistance of an independent third party  management is primarily responsible for the valuation 
these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
we expect to continue these development efforts and believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  there is risk associated with the completion of the projects  and there is no assurance that any will meet either technological or commercial success 
interest income expense interest income decreased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year the decrease was due to a decrease in short term interest rates during fiscal years and this was partially offset by our investments in long term held to maturity investments 
interest expense also decreased to million from million for same time periods 
tax expense the tax rate for fiscal year of differs from the tax expense for fiscal year of due primarily to the write off of in process research and development resulting from the elantec acquisition during the second quarter of this difference in rates can also be attributed to higher research and development credits  increased sales in lower tax jurisdictions and a shift from taxable to tax exempt investments during in determining net income  we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
backlog we had backlog at january  of million compared to million at january  the backlog as of january  excludes million related to the wireless networking product group 

table of contents fiscal year compared fiscal year the following table sets forth statement of operations data in dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated below year ended year ended january  december  january  december  in thousands revenue costs and expenses cost of product sales a research and development b selling  general and administrative b amortization of intangibles amortization of unearned compensation in process research and development impairment of long lived assets restructuring operating income loss interest income  net loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on investments gain on sale of certain operations income loss before income taxes income taxes income loss before discontinued operations discontinued operations income loss from discontinued operations income taxes benefit from discontinued operations net income loss from discontinued operations net income loss a cost of product sales includes the following unearned compensation b unearned compensation is excluded from the following research and development selling  general and administrative revenue revenue from continuing operations for fiscal year increased to million from million during fiscal year the acquisition of elantec during the second quarter of contributed million to the increase in sales year over year 
also  our power management product group grew million due to increased demand in desktop computer products 
the exits of our discrete power and automotive product groups offset revenue increases by million 
we also experienced a decline in revenue of approximately million due to an economic downturn in the communication end market 
in addition  our change in revenue recognition decreased revenue by million 
geographically   and of product sales were derived in asia pacific  north america and europe  respectively  during fiscal year compared to  and during fiscal year this change is the result of increased demand from asian based customers and increased customer use of asian based contract manufacturers 
also  the acquisition of elantec contributed to the increase in this region as that product group s sales are generated primarily from shipments to japan 

table of contents gross profit in fiscal year  gross profit on product sales increased or million to million from million in the fiscal year as a percentage of sales  gross margin was during fiscal year compared to during the fiscal year  a percentage point improvement 
the acquisition of elantec  which increased our mix of higher margin products  improved gross profit by million 
in addition  we closed our findlay fabrication facility in fiscal year  which had approximately a million improvement on gross profit 
these improvements were primarily offset by a million decline as a result of our change in revenue recognition for north american distributors 
research and development r d r d expenses increased to million during fiscal year from million during the fiscal year as a percentage of sales  r d expenses increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the acquisition of elantec contributed approximately million to the overall increase as well as increased spending in for our power management product development 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a costs increased to million during fiscal year from million during the fiscal year as a percentage of sales  sg a costs increased to for from for the fiscal year the acquisition of elantec was again the primary driver for this increase with approximately million of sg a expenses during amortization amortization of intangible assets decreased to million for fiscal year from million for the same time period in fiscal year unearned compensation amortization of unearned compensation was million during fiscal year this was a result of the acquisition of elantec and is the intrinsic value of unvested elantec options outstanding at the time of the merger 
the intrinsic value of each option was calculated as the excess of the fair market value of one share of our class a common stock as determined using the average closing sales price of our class a common stock on may  and may  of over the option price 
the unearned compensation costs are recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options as an operating expense 
impairment of long lived assets in connection with the closure of our findlay  ohio manufacturing operation  we recorded an impairment of million million after tax on the property  plant and equipment during the fiscal year the impairment was determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to an appraised value on the land  equipment and buildings and the expected future undiscounted net cash flows from the equipment to be disposed in accordance with sfas during fiscal year  we recorded two impairments totaling million 
the first impairment of million million net of tax related to the property  plant and equipment within the findlay  ohio manufacturing facility 
the write down reduced the carrying value of the assets to their fair value  which was based on the contractual sales price of the assets 
prior to this impairment  the carrying value of the findlay assets was million 
as these assets were held and used until their disposal  we continued depreciation over their remaining useful lives 
the remaining million million net of tax impairment is primarily related to the adjustment of idle equipment to their fair value based on estimated future cash flows from these assets 
interest income expense interest income decreased to million during fiscal year from million during the fiscal year the decrease was due to a decrease in short term interest rates during fiscal years and interest expense also decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease was due to the elimination of our long term debt during the first quarter of fiscal year gain loss on investments marketable securities consist of shares of chippac common stock that have been classified as other long term investments 
they are recorded at fair value  which is determined based on quoted market prices 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our 
table of contents investment in chippac common stock  which reflected an other than temporary decline in value 
in arriving at this decision  we considered various factors  including the fact that chippac s stock price was less than its carrying value during two consecutive quarters 
we also considered the overall macroeconomic condition of the semiconductor industry at the time 
during fiscal year  we recorded a gain of million million after tax from the sale of our investment in powersmart  inc the gain was calculated as the excess of the proceeds from disposition of the investment over its carrying value 
loss on extinguishment of debt during fiscal year  we repurchased all million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes in the open market 
these repayments included certain pre payment penalties and accrued interest 
in connection with the early extinguishment of debt  we recorded a million charge million net of tax 
the charges consisted of the write off of deferred financing fees and premiums paid on repurchase 
gain on sale of certain operations on march   we sold the assets of its discrete power product group to fairchild for million in cash and the assumption by fairchild of certain liabilities of the product group 
as a result of the sale  we recognized a gain of million million after tax  which was net of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed by fairchild  transaction fees and other exit costs associated with the sale 
the exit costs include employee termination benefits to be incurred within one year from the sale date as well as information technology costs required to cover transferred software license fees and system modifications necessary to support the business transition activity 
we also closed three foreign sales offices as a result of the sale 
also  included in the calculation of the gain was the write off of million of intangible assets that were related to our formation from the assets of harris corporation s semiconductor business in august the assets represent the developed technology  customer base and assembled workforce for the discrete power product group  which were derived from the original valuation completed at the time of the acquisition 
tax expense the tax rate of for fiscal year differs from the tax rate for fiscal year of primarily due to the gain generated from the sale of our discrete power products group recorded during fiscal year and the write off of elantec s in process r d in fiscal year backlog we had backlog at january  of million compared to million at december  this excludes million and million related to the wireless networking product group 
business outlook on january   we announced our outlook for the first quarter of we expected revenue for the first quarter to be equal to or slightly above the revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year we also expected cost of product sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative costs to generally trend in the same direction as revenue 
we expected intangible amortization expense to be million and amortization of unearned compensation to be million 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately for fiscal year we expect to finalize the internal revenue service irs audits for calendar years and by the end of the first quarter of this could have a material positive impact on our tax provision and operating results for fiscal year restructurings march in march  our board of directors approved and we announced major restructuring activities to improve ongoing operations and product gross margins 
this restructuring plan was predicated on the phased closure of our findlay  ohio manufacturing operation and the exit of the modem board assembly manufacturing process in scottsdale  arizona 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded expenses of approximately million million after tax within continuing operations during fiscal year costs of the restructuring plan include employee termination costs  costs incurred to decontaminate and defacilitate the fabrication facility and contract cancellation costs 
employee termination costs include involuntary severance payments and outplacement training 
decontamination and defacilitation costs include costs for removing and disposing of air handlers  exhausts  structural steel  process cooling loops  gas piping and acid distribution systems used in conjunction with equipment 
other decommission costs include costs to secure equipment remaining on site after closure 
contract cancellation costs include fees charged 
table of contents to us under non cancelable purchase orders from three vendors 
in connection with the announced restructuring  approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and were apprised of the specifics of their severance benefits 
the affected positions included manufacturing  selling  general and administrative employees 
of the employees were located in the united states and was located in europe 
the sale of the findlay  ohio manufacturing operation was completed late in september  and  accordingly  all of the affected employees had been terminated as of january  no remaining activities exist with respect to the execution of this plan 
we estimated that annual savings of cost of product sales would be approximately million to million annually 
these savings are largely in the form of decreased payroll  healthcare costs  and factory overhead  which is comprised of depreciation  utilities and property taxes 
although determination of actual savings is difficult to determine because of changes in product mix  technological specifications and product demand  we believe that actual savings have been approximately million annually 
june after the merger with elantec  we accrued for restructuring activities relating to the consolidation of the combined entity s business operations 
these costs were not included in the purchase price determination and the allocation thereof as they relate to our activities that were conducted prior to the merger 
as a result of the restructuring  we recorded a charge of million million after tax in continuing operations during fiscal year the restructuring plan includes employee termination costs and the elimination of certain sales and marketing activities existing prior to the merger 
employee termination costs include involuntary severance payments and outplacement training 
costs incurred to eliminate certain sales and marketing activities include lease cancellation costs and costs associated with the termination of sales representative agreements 
as a result of the merger with elantec  of our employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and were apprised of the specifics of their severance benefits 
affected positions included primarily selling employees  of whom were located in the united states  in europe and in asia 
as of january   all of the affected employees had been terminated 
no remaining activities exist with respect to the execution of this plan 
we estimated that annual savings of selling  general and administrative costs to be approximately million  which includes decreased payroll  healthcare costs  sales office lease expenses  and decreased payments to sales representatives 
we believe there has not been significant variances between the expected savings and actual savings 
january in january  we announced a cost reduction initiative predicated on a reduction in workforce 
due to the implementation of sfas  severance related costs cannot be expensed until incurred 
however  the severance agreements under this restructuring plan entitle terminated employees to benefits upon notification of termination 
accordingly  we expensed million million net of tax in continuing operations during fiscal year the restructuring plan includes employee termination costs  which include involuntary severance payments and outplacement training 
in connection with the cost reduction initiative  employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and were apprised of the specifics of their severance benefits 
the affected positions included manufacturing  selling  general and administrative employees  all of such employees were located in the united states 
as of january   all of the affected employees had been terminated 
no remaining activities exist with respect to the execution of this plan 
we estimate that annual savings of cost of product sales are approximately million 
we also estimate that annual savings of research and development expenses are million 
finally  we estimate that annual savings of selling  general and administrative expenses are million 
these savings are in the form of decreased payroll and healthcare costs 
we believe there have not been significant variances between the planned savings and actual savings 
we believe there have not been significant variances between the planned savings and actual savings 
august in august  we announced a restructuring plan that coincided with the sale of our wireless networking product group 
the restructuring plan includes the termination of approximately of the remaining workforce and the closure of three sales office locations in the united states and europe 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  a company can only accrue costs related to liabilities that have been incurred 
the terms of the relevant severance benefits stipulate that an employee is entitled to payments if that employee remains employed with us through his or her termination date 
thus during fiscal year  we recorded charges of million for the portion of severance benefits and lease payments that we were obligated to pay as of january  employee termination costs include involuntary severance payments and the provision of outplacement training 
in connection with the cost reduction initiative  employees were notified that their employment would be terminated and were apprised of the specifics of their 
table of contents severance benefits 
the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees  of such employees were located in the united states  in europe and in asia 
as of january   of the affected employees had been terminated 
the remaining employees will be terminated within the next months at a cost of million 
we estimate that annual savings of cost of product sales are approximately million 
we also estimate that annual savings of research and development expenses are million 
finally  we estimate that annual savings of selling  general and administrative expenses are million 
these savings are in the form of decreased payroll  healthcare costs and lease expenses 
due to the recent date of this plan  it is difficult to ascertain if there have been significant variances between the expected savings and actual savings 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations  all of which are off balance sheet arrangements  as of january  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments test and package purchase commitment see below see below see below open capital equipment purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments standby letters of credit total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open raw material purchase commitments are comprised of purchase orders for foundry wafers million  silicon wafers million as well other miscellaneous expense items 
we utilize standby letters of credit primarily for security for workers compensation million  environmental items million  electricity million as well as for security for our vendors 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
we have an agreement in place with chippac pursuant to which they provide us with  among other things  testing and packaging services for fees  subject to certain limits and exceptions  including competitive pricing 
the initial term of this agreement expires on june  we do not have any guarantees that would affect our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
we do not have any relationships with other parties that would have a negative impact on our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products on line  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including the requisite capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements  our dividend program  our treasury share repurchase program and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of january   our total shareholders equity was  million 
also  we had million in cash and short term securities  as well as million in long term investments held to maturity 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was million 
this was primarily due to operating income of million 
this was offset by our changes in assets and liabilities of million including increased inventories for both our continuing and discontinued operations offset by timing of income tax payments 
net cash provided by investing activities for fiscal year was million 
we have received million in cash proceeds from the sale our wireless networking product group to globespanvirata 
this was offset 
table of contents by million of transaction costs relating to the sale 
we also received million in proceeds from the sale of globespanvirata and chippac common stock during fiscal year this was offset by investments in long term cash investments of million to improve interest yields and million in property  plant and equipment to increase our production capacity 
we expect our expenditures for property  plant and equipment to be within the million to million range during fiscal year net cash used by financing activities for fiscal year was million resulting from purchase of treasury stock under the stock repurchase plan offset by the proceeds of exercised stock options 
we expect to continue this level of share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance at january  was million 
we have a treasury stock repurchase program  which authorizes us to repurchase up to million in our common stock  of which million had been used as of january  the program was set to expire on september   but by a vote of the board of directors it has been extended through december we have separately classified on the face of the balance sheet our current held to maturity investments  which consist of securities with maturities less than one year but greater than days 
these balances can be converted to cash upon request at a minimal discount 
we have reclassified prior period balance sheet and cash flow information to conform with the current classification 
working capital trade accounts receivable  less the allowance for collection losses  totaled million at january  compared to million at january  this decrease was a result of the sale of our wireless networking product group  which had over million in receivables at the time of the sale  the majority of which had been collected by the end of fiscal year however  inventories increased to million at january  from million at january  the majority of the increase is attributable to purchases made in order to build end of life inventory for elantec products in anticipation of moving the production operations to palm bay from milpitas as well as buffer inventory for our power management products required by certain customers 
our income taxes payable also increased million from million driven primarily by income tax provisions relating to the sale of our wireless networking group 
trade accounts payable decreased million as we saw reduced purchases from the foundries we used for wireless networking product materials as well as decreased expenditures on manufacturing equipment 
however  litigation accruals increased million from fiscal year to fiscal year this was primarily driven by our lawsuit with agere 
sales reserves fluctuate from year to year based on items such as the level of inventory at distributors and customer returns near year end as well as sales volume 
the sales reserves increased to million at january  from million at january  this increase was driven by increased sales volume of over fiscal year as well as rebates of approximately million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year the increase is due primarily to increased investments in our foundry operations  for which we spent million during fiscal year additional capital expenditures during fiscal year includes the expansion of our fabrication facility in palm bay  florida in order to accommodate the transfer of certain production processes from our findlay  ohio and milpitas  california facilities  as well as general manufacturing capacity increases of million  research and development capital of million and information technology equipment of million 
transactions with related and certain other parties we hold a receivable balance within the other assets section in our balance sheet resulting from a loan made to one of our employees who is neither the cfo or ceo 
the loan  which totaled million at january   was made by elantec prior to the merger as part of employment offers 
the loan is a recourse loan  and the security is in the form of a second trust deed on the employee s real property

table of contents critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on our financial condition 
the five accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  distributor reserves  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and tax valuation allowances 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables was million on gross trade receivables of million at january  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of january  since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of january  can not be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
we maintain an allowance of approximately of a gross trade receivable balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
the reserve for excess or obsolete inventory was million at january  the reserve for excess or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of standard cost or market as described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will recoup through sales on our inventory levels as of january  can not be known with exact certainty as of the date of this filing  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although due to the commonality between our products  raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we reserve of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
reviews are conducted of excess inventory on a monthly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or re classified as obsolete 
we reserve approximately to of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that to represents the portion we will not be able to recover when we attempt to sell this inventory due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete during the process described above  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization specific to that inventory 
distributor reserves were million at january  revenue is recognized from sales to all other customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on and rights to periodically exchange a percentage of unsold inventory they hold 
accordingly  distributor reserves are amounts within the liability section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of inventory adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory held by international distributors as of january  that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions 
the international distributor reserves comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor reserves is the price protection reserve  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices 
this reserve is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to 
table of contents distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation reserve  which is based on the percentage of sales made to certain distributors in europe whereby the distributors can periodically exchange a percentage of older inventories with newer products 
actual price protection and stock rotation changes have historically been within management s expectations 
international distributor reserves are combined with other product sales reserves within the sales reserves line item on the balance sheet 
these include reserves for unearned revenue for payments on last time buy products of million  price rebates of million product warranties for million  as well as other revenue related accruals of million 
effective march   we began to recognize revenue to north american distributors on a sell through basis 
as such  we now recognize sales to north american distributors upon shipment to the end customer 
formerly  we recognized revenue from north american distributor sales upon shipment to the distributors 
the combination of the changes resulting from the integration with elantec  changes in the distributor mix and changes in market pricing affect the estimability of customer acceptance of our products 
pursuant to sfas  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives as of december  and found no impairment 
according to our accounting policy  we also performed an annual review during the fourth quarter of  and in both reviews we found no impairment 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under the two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
our reporting units are the high performance analog and elantec product groups because they are each managed by a general manager and have discrete financial information 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at january   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
this interpretation defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when this interpretation becomes effective  the enterprise shall disclose information about those entities in all financial statements issued after january  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we have completed our assessment of this interpretation and determined that we are not party to any variable interest entities as of january

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
at january   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of million  which was to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
total net losses on foreign exchange contracts for the fiscal year were less than million 
during the fiscal year  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward 
table of contents contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was nominal  at january  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended january  january  gain loss on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end the decrease in the notional amounts of open foreign exchange contracts at year end is due to the consolidation of elantec s hedging process into one corporate program 
our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at january  would have an impact of approximately million on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments
