overview we develop  manufacture  and market fully integrated systems that perform genetic analysis  including dna or rna analysis  for the clinical genetic assessment  life sciences and biothreat markets 
our systems enable rapid  sophisticated genetic testing of organisms by automating otherwise complex manual laboratory procedures 
genetic testing involves a number of complicated steps  including sample preparation  amplification and detection 
based on state of the art microfluidic and microelectronic technologies  our easy to use systems integrate these steps and analyze complex biological samples in our proprietary test cartridges 
we are focusing our efforts on those applications where rapid genetic testing is particularly important  such as the infectious disease  cancer and biothreat testing markets 
in particular  we have designed our systems to be capable of use in clinical genetic assessment 
we have designed our systems to perform a broad range of genetic tests that are used to identify infectious organisms  enhance cancer management and care and identify organisms that could be used as bio terrorism agents 
our two principal product platforms are our smart cycler and genexpert systems 
our initial product platform  the smart cycler  integrates dna amplification and detection to allow rapid genetic analysis of a sample 
we commenced sales of the smart cycler in may  and  in our estimation  we have sold more than  units to date to a wide range of customers 
some of these customers include cdc  the cleveland clinic  fda  johns hopkins university  magee womens hospital  memorial sloan kettering cancer center  the national institutes of health  stanford university and usamriid 
our second product platform  the genexpert  integrates automated sample preparation with our smart cycler amplification and detection technology 
we recently began shipping genexpert modules and anthrax test cartridges for use in the biothreat market 
for example  the genexpert module is being incorporated in a bds developed for the usps 
the genexpert system  a self contained system that contains the genexpert module and related software  is in the final stages of development 
we sell our products through both direct sales and various distribution channels worldwide 
in addition  we are collaborating with strategic partners to co develop assays  or biological tests 
some of our significant collaborators include the children s medical center of dallas  the fred hutchinson cancer research center  the university of pittsburgh medical center and usamriid 
the bds for the usps has been developed by a northrop grumman led consortium that includes cepheid and other subcontractors 
this consortium was awarded a production contract that the usps has indicated will include a million first phase  with the usps having an option for a second phase 
we believe that we will realize to of the first phase amount  the majority of which we believe we will realize in the second half of at the core of the bds  cepheid s genexpert technology rapidly analyzes air samples taken from usps processing lines to detect dna from any potential anthrax spores as mail moves through the processing equipment 
the shipment and validation of the first article production genexpert modules for the usps program had been completed in the fourth quarter of the bds is currently scheduled to be installed on a production basis in identified usps mail sorting facilities throughout the united states during sales channels we sell our products into the clinical genetic assessment  life sciences and biothreat markets through both direct and various distribution channels 
in the united states  we sell through our non exclusive distributor  fisher scientific as well as our ten person direct sales force 
in europe  we sell primarily through distributors 
cepheid sa  our french subsidiary  has facilitated the establishment of additional distributors in europe  leading to increased product sales in that region 
in the far east and other non us markets  we sell solely through distribution channels 
in  we will continue to expand into other territories throughout the world through the addition of distributors 
revenues during  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales of smart cyclers and associated disposables and reagents and  to a lesser extent  from sales of genexpert anthrax cartridges and modules to northrop grumman and smiths detection for use in the usps program and from contract revenue derived from research and development arrangements 
in  we expect sales of genexpert anthrax cartridges to become a more significant portion of our revenue as the usps bds program enters into the production phase 
we intend to focus our efforts primarily on developing additional tests for use on our smart cycler and genexpert platforms 
in addition  in we expect to recognize revenues from the amortization of the up front license payments in connection with our collaboration with biomerieux 
products we commenced commercial sales of the smart cycler in may we began shipping the smart cycler ii  which features various enhancements to the smart cycler  in november our genexpert module has been incorporated in the usps bds  and is currently being sold for integration by partner companies into their systems 
a self contained version of the genexpert system is in the final stages of development 
we currently anticipate commercial launch of the self contained genexpert system into non clinical markets in the second half of and in the clinical genetic assessment market in we have begun to develop and sell tests for use with the smart cycler and genexpert system 
we currently market a gbs test for use with our smart cycler systems and a genexpert anthrax test cartridge for use in the usps bds program 
in addition  we are working internally and with partners to develop a variety of tests for use on our smart cycler and genexpert system for other applications  including mrsa  vre  sln and melanoma sln 
recent developments in december  we entered into an agreement for a strategic commercial relationship with biomerieux for biomerieux to develop dna testing products using our proprietary or nasba technology to be run on systems employing our smart cycler and genexpert platforms 
we will receive up to a total of million in potential payments under this agreement  in addition to potential product purchases and royalty payments on end user genexpert test cartridge sales 
of the million fee  million has been received 
of the remaining million  million is due on june  and the remaining million will become due if biomerieux commercializes a product based on our technology 
in february  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering under a new registration statement 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory reserve  and warranty accrual to be critical accounting policies 
inherent in our determination of when to recognize revenue  and in our calculation of our inventory reserve and warranty accrual  are a number of significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments include deciding whether the elements required to recognize revenue from a particular arrangement are present and estimating the amount of inventory obsolescence and warranty costs associated with shipped products 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
determining whether the elements required for us to recognize revenue are present including  for example  determining whether there is sufficient evidence that an arrangement exists  the collectibility of billings and whether contractual performance obligations and milestones have been met requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect our operating results 
for example  our determination of the probability of collection is based upon assessment of the customer s financial condition through review of their current financial statements or publicly available credit reports 
for sales to existing customers  prior payment history is also considered in assessing probability of collection 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in deciding whether collectibility is reasonably assured  and such judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenues and our results of operations 
product sales 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped  there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
no right of return exists for our products except in the case of damaged goods 
we have not experienced any significant returns of our products 
contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of fees for technology licenses  fees for services rendered under research and development arrangements  grants and government sponsored research agreements  milestone payments and royalties received under license and collaboration agreements 
deferred revenue is recorded when funds are received in advance of technologies to be delivered or services to be performed 
license revenue is generally recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
however  in multiple element revenue arrangements  if the delivered technology does not have stand alone value or if we do not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered products or services  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered technology is deferred and amortized over the related involvement period in which the remaining products or services are provided to the customer 
research and development and government sponsored research contract revenues are recognized as the related services are performed based on the performance requirements of the relevant contract 
under the agreements  we are required to perform specific research and development activities and are compensated based on the costs  or costs plus a mark up  associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement 
incentive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  assuming there are no continuing performance obligations related to that milestone 
incentive milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the arrangement and are normally triggered by events external to cepheid 
royalties are based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured  and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the customer 
inventory reserve and warranty accrual we maintain reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs that we believe are reasonable and that are based on our historical experience and current expectations for future performance 
the inventory reserve is established using management s estimate of the potential future obsolescence of inventory 
as of december   reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million 
a substantial decrease in demand for our products or the introduction of new products could lead to excess inventories and could require us to increase our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
our current estimate or assumption is consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
our warranty accrual is established using management s estimate for the future costs of any instrument failures during the one year warranty period 
as of december   warranty accrual was approximately million 
a significant change in failure rates of our smart cycler system could lead to increased warranty costs and could require us to increase our warranty reserve 
if such adverse conditions were to occur  we cannot readily predict what effect on our financial condition or results of operations would result  as any such effect would depend on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions 
our current estimate or assumption is consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which was originally effective for cepheid on july  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin to december  for interests held by public companies in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  fin requires a variable interest to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to a receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
we have completed its evaluation of the provisions of fin and do not have any significant interests in variable interest entities 
accordingly  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb issued eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses certain aspects of the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
under eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration should be allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for each of the separate units 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into beginning july  the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in total revenues in as compared to was primarily due to an overall increase in product sales 
total product sales increased to million in from million in out of the increase in  came from increased sales volume of our existing products and the remainder came primarily from the sales of our new products such as smart cycler ii and gbs 
the growth in product sales in as compared to resulted from the growth of sales volume of our smart cycler system  particularly in europe as well as increasing sales volume of genexpert anthrax cartridges and modules to northrop grumman and smiths detection under the usps program 
the increase in product sales in europe was due primarily to the establishment of several new distributors in this region through our wholly owned french subsidiary  cepheid sa 
in and  product sales through distributors represented and  respectively  of our total product sales including instruments  reagents and disposables 
we had one direct customer that represented of product sales for the year ended december  and had no direct customers that represented more than of product sales for the year ended december  the following table provides a breakdown of our product sales by geographic regions year ended december  as of total product sales total product sales north america europe far east product sales through distributors north america europe far east no single country outside of the united states represented more than of our total revenues in any period presented 
contract revenues increased to  in from  in this increase resulted from work performed in conjunction with our participation in the pilot program to develop the bds for the usps 
we expect our contract revenue to increase in as a result of our collaboration with biomerieux in which we expect to derive revenues from license fees as well as payments on research and development services over the next five years 
grant and government sponsored research revenue increased to million in from million in the revenue was derived principally from our research and development contract with the usamriid 
we expect a decline in grant and government sponsored research revenue in as the usamriid contract was completed in november cost of product sales cost of product sales consists of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead  facility costs and warranty costs 
cost of product sales decreased to million in from million in our product gross margin percentage in was as compared to in the increase of in product gross margin in as compared to was due primarily to a change in product mix to higher gross margin products and overall higher sales volume leading to increased manufacturing economies of scale 
out of the increase in  a shift in our product mix to higher gross margin products accounted for and increased manufacturing economies of scale due to increased volumes of our existing products along with new product introductions accounted for most of the remainder of the increase as compared to research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of salaries and personnel related expenses  research and development materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the primary reason for the decrease in as compared to was a reduction in work force that we completed in september specifically  the decrease in as compared to was comprised primarily of a million decrease in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million decrease in outside engineering and consulting costs  a million decrease in facilities allocation and a million decrease in amortization of deferred stock compensation  partially offset by a million increase in research and development materials 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase slightly in as we continue our product development efforts  particularly with respect to developing assays for the smart cycler and genexpert systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses  travel  facility  legal  accounting and other professional fees 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the organization and establishment of our wholly owned french subsidiary in the fourth quarter of  which resulted in a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  and increases in sales and marketing and executive headcount 
specifically  the increase in as compared to was comprised primarily of a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  a million increase in travel expenses due to the increased sales activities  a million increase in consulting costs and a million increase in insurance costs  partially offset by a million decrease in amortization of deferred stock compensation 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in as we continue to make additional investments in sales and marketing 
collaboration profit sharing the  in collaboration profit sharing in was related to the profit sharing provision under our collaboration agreement with applied biosystems to develop reagents for use in the bds developed for the usps 
under the agreement  gross margin on anthrax cartridge sales are shared between the two parties 
other income  net other income  net consists of interest income  interest expense and foreign exchange gain or loss 
other income  net decreased to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from our lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower interest rates  partially offset by foreign exchange gain in income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million 
our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in total revenues in as compared to was due to an overall increase in product sales  partially offset by a decline in contract revenues 
total product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the growth in product sales in as compared to resulted from an increase of in instrument sales  particularly of the smart cycler system  initial prototype sales of our genexpert system  and an increase of more than in reagent and disposable sales  particularly our disposable smart cycler reaction tubes 
the increase in product sales was due to the growth of sales through our international distribution network and direct sales force in the united states  and growing market acceptance of the smart cycler system 
in  product sales through distributors represented of our total product sales including instruments  reagents and disposables 
we had no direct customers that represented more than of product sales in either or contract revenues increased million to million in this increase primarily resulted from work performed in conjunction with our participation in the pilot program to develop a bds for the usps 
grant and government sponsored research revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted from a decline in the number of active government contracts worked on during as compared to cost of product sales cost of product sales increased to million in from million in the increase in absolute dollars of cost of product sales in as compared to was driven by the corresponding increase in product sales 
our product gross margin percentage in was as compared to in the increase in product gross margin in as compared to was due to increased economies of scale due to increased production volume and improved product pricing of our smart cycler system resulting from more direct sales  partially offset by increased warranty costs 
the increase in warranty costs is primarily due to million in warranty costs recognized in the third quarter of to enhance the reliability of the smart cycler system 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from a million increase in facilities costs related to our new company headquarters  a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses because of increased headcount  and million increase in depreciation and amortization  partially offset by a million decrease in the amortization of deferred stock compensation and a million decrease in outside engineering and consulting costs 
the overall increase in research and development expenses in as compared to was primarily related to our development efforts for the genexpert system 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in as compared to was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  primarily comprised of salaries for increased sales  marketing and executive headcount  million in severance costs  a million increase in sales commissions due to increased product sales  a million increase in travel and lodging costs primarily due to our expanded direct sales force  and a million increase in legal costs  partially offset by a million decrease in our amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation 
other income  net other income  net decreased to  in from million in the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from our lower average cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower interest rates and an increase in interest expense resulting from increased borrowings on our lease line of credit in restructuring expenses we incurred restructuring expenses of  related to the restructuring plan that we completed during the quarter ended september  the restructuring charge was primarily composed of severance costs for terminated employees and  to small degree  professional fees and the write off of impaired assets 
in connection with the plan  our headcount was reduced by approximately 
the purpose of the restructuring plan was to realign our workforce to reflect our shift in emphasis from research and development to manufacturing and marketing of our instruments and reagent systems 
there were no remaining cash payments to be made under this restructuring plan at december  income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flow as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents including million in restricted cash 
in  we received a total of million in cash proceeds  net of issuance costs  from sales of our common stock under our shelf registration statement 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in short term commercial paper and money market funds in order to minimize market risk and preserve principal 
through december   we had raised approximately million in aggregate net proceeds from sales of our equity securities 
in addition  in february  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering under a new registration statement declared effective in february net cash used for operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net cash used for operating activities primarily consisted of million in cost of sales  million in research and development costs  million in selling  general and administration expenses and a million increase in inventory  largely offset by million in cash received from customers  which included million in payments from biomerieux 
in  net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in cost of product sales  million in research and development costs and million in selling  general and administration expenses  partially offset by million in cash received from customers and a million decease in payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
in  net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in cost of product sales  million in research and development costs  million in selling  general and administration expenses and a million increase in inventory  partially offset by million in cash received from customers and million cash from interest income 
the above amounts for cost of sales  research and development costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are net of stock based compensation expenses and depreciation and amortization on property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  and net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities in consisted of million in capital expenditures partially offset by a million decrease in restricted cash due to the termination of two standby letters of credit resulting in the return of corresponding collateral 
net cash provided by investing activities in consisted of million from the maturity of marketable securities  partially offset by million in capital expenditures and million in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities in consisted of million in capital expenditures  million for the purchase of marketable securities  and million in restricted cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the million in consisted of proceeds of million from sales of common stock  including net proceeds of million from our common stock offerings  and million in proceeds from equipment loans  partially offset by repayments of million on our equipment and mortgage loans 
the million in consisted of proceeds of million from sales of common stock  including net proceeds of million from our august common stock offering  and million in proceeds from equipment and mortgage loans  partially offset by repayments of million on our equipment and mortgage loans 
the million in included proceeds of million from sales of common stock under employee stock purchase plan and proceeds of million from equipment loans  partially offset by repayments of million on our equipment loans 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter  were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total contractual obligations equipment loans    operating leases      purchase obligations   minimum royalty payments   total      through december   we had financed a total of approximately million in equipment purchases under an equipment financing agreement 
our total obligation under this agreement was approximately million at december  the equipment loans are secured by the financed equipment  bear interest at a weighted average interest rate of and are due in monthly installments through december under certain of the equipment financing agreement  a balloon payment is due at the end of each individual lease term of the underlying equipment 
in october  we provided a letter of credit in the amount of million to the creditor as additional security for our obligations under this agreement  and our ability to draw down additional funding under our agreement was suspended 
in september  the creditor waived the letter of credit and we were permitted to draw down additional amounts under the equipment financing agreement 
as of december   we had approximately million in credit available under this agreement 
purchase obligations include purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for six months 
minimum royalty payments represent technology license fees we are obligated to pay for our exclusive license from llnl 
total obligation amount presented in the table does not include contractual obligations recorded as current liabilities on the balance sheet as of december  the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
financial condition outlook we plan to continue to make expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity  to support our activities in sales and marketing and research and development  to support our working capital needs  and to obtain technology licenses 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on automated manufacturing equipment and approximately million on leasehold improvements  equipment and computer hardware and software 
we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through at least the end of our total cash used in was million excluding the million in net proceeds received from our common stock offerings during the year 
after the proceeds of approximately million from our february common stock offering and the second license fee payment of million from biomerieux due in june  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for the next several years 
this expectation is based on our current and long term operating plan and may change as a result of many factors  including our future capital requirements and our ability to increase revenues and reduce expenses  which  in many instances  depend on a number of factors outside our control 
for example  our future cash use will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology or to use our technology in new markets  and the availability of other financing 
in the future  we may seek additional funds to support our strategic business needs and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or equity related securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms to meet our business needs  our business may be harmed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our investments in interest bearing assets are subject to interest rate risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our interest bearing portfolio  which consists of cash and cash equivalents  in short term commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of the investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore we have not included quantitative tabular disclosure in this form k 
we do not enter into financial investments for speculation or trading purposes and are not a party to financial or commodity derivatives 
we have operated primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenue  cost  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars for accordingly  we do not have material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
