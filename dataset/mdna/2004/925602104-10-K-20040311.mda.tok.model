item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements above 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we research and develop biopharmaceutical products based on our patented dna delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life threatening diseases 
in addition to advancing our core technology  we have gained access to additional enhancing technologies through licensing and collaborative agreements 
we believe the following areas of research offer the greatest potential for our product development efforts vaccines for use in high risk populations for infectious disease targets for which there are significant us needs  vaccines for general pediatric or adult populations for infectious disease applications for which a challenge model or accepted surrogate marker are available  and cancer vaccines or immunotherapies which complement our existing programs and core expertise 
for opportunities outside these areas  we plan to continue leveraging our patented technology through licensing and collaborations 
in addition  we plan to use our expertise  infrastructure  and financial strength to explore in licensing or acquisition opportunities 
we have established relationships through licensing our technology to a number of commercial entities  including merck co  inc  two divisions of aventis sa aventis pasteur  and aventis pharma sa  merial  aqua health ltd  an affiliate of novartis animal health inc invitrogen corporation  human genome sciences  inc  and corautus genetics inc  formerly vascular genetics inc 
we have also licensed complementary technologies from the university of michigan  cytrx corporation  genetronics biomedical corporation  the national institutes of health  the us centers for disease control and prevention  the ohio state university  and the city of hope national medical center 
to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of our products 
we earn revenue from licensing access to our proprietary technology  and by performing services under research and development contracts and grants  and manufacturing contracts 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the expansion of our research and development programs  the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials  spending for outside services  costs related to maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  costs due to increased contract manufacturing activities  increased costs of our pcc facility  and possible advancement toward commercialization activities 
losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the levels of expenses incurred and the amounts of revenues received from various sources 
such fluctuations may be significant 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect our net loss for to be between million and million 
results of operations revenues were million for the year ended december  license and royalty revenue for was million and represented recognition of deferred license fees from corautus  a license payment from aqua health ltd 
and royalty revenue 
contract revenue of million for  was from the nih  the iavi  the vrc and the onr  and included million of grant revenue for an anthrax sbir grant 
revenues for the year ended december   were million  compared with revenues of million for the year ended december  license and royalty revenue in was million and consisted of recognition of license payments from merial and centocor totaling million  recognition of deferred license fees primarily from merial and vgi totaling million  and royalty revenue of million on the sale of proprietary lipids by invitrogen 
contract revenue in was million and included revenues from the nih  the iavi and the onr 
license and royalty revenue of million in included scheduled milestone payments of million from merck and million from centocor  and royalty and other revenue of million 
license revenue in also included recognition of deferred license fees of million from merial and vgi  and of million primarily from our agreement with pfizer as a result of applying a change in accounting principle to conform to the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab contract revenue of million for included million of revenues from the contract with the onr  revenue from contracts and grants with the nih  and revenue from pfizer and other agreements 
our total operating expenses for the year ended december   were million compared with million for the same period in the prior year 
operating expenses for the years ended december  and  included write downs of investment of million and million  respectively  as more fully explained below 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million in the comparable period in the increase in was due to higher facilities costs and personnel related costs largely offset by lower clinical trial costs and the deferral of certain contract manufacturing costs which are not expensed until the related revenue is recognized upon product shipment 
research and development expenses increased to million in compared with million in this increase primarily was due to increased personnel costs  and higher facilities related and preclinical costs 
clinical trial costs were million in compared with million in the decrease was due to completion of enrollment of the high dose allovectin trial in july clinical trial costs decreased to million in compared with million in due to completion of the low dose allovectin registration trials in and discontinuing the leuvectin kidney cancer trial 
in  we expect research and development expense to increase as we expand our preclinical and clinical programs to broaden our future pipeline 
we further expect these efforts to drive increases in spending for outside services  and costs related to intellectual property 
we also expect to incur increased costs as a result of a full year of occupancy in pcc  increased contract manufacturing activities and possible preparation for commercialization activities associated with allovectin 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared with million in the decrease in compared with was due to lower personnel related costs  including lower incentive based compensation expense  lower professional fees and lower facilities costs due to sublease loss accruals recorded in general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared with million in general and administrative expenses increased in compared with primarily due to increased personnel related costs and increased facilities costs 
operating expenses in and also included write downs of our investment in vgi  now corautus 
in february  we received shares of preferred stock in vgi in exchange for a license to our technology 
the shares were recorded as an investment on the balance sheet at an estimated fair value of million 
no cash was received or paid by either party to this transaction 
in september  we wrote down the investment in vgi to million based on objective values established as a result of a proposed merger between vgi and genstar  a public company listed on the amex 
the vgi shares continued to be reflected as an investment on the balance sheet at december  operating expenses for the year ended december   also included a write down of investment of million in march in february  genstar and vgi completed their merger and created a new entity  corautus 
in connection with the merger  the shares of vgi were exchanged for common stock of corautus  which is listed on the amex 
the value of our corautus shares as measured by the quoted price on the amex on march   was million compared with our recorded value of million 
based on this market information  we wrote down our investment to million in march the market value of our investment in corautus at december   was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an expense of million for the expected loss on vacant leased space that was expected to be subleased at rental rates less than those incurred by us and on the unamortized balance of leasehold improvements 
of this amount  million was reflected in general and administrative expense and million was recorded in research and development expense 
in  we subleased the majority of the vacated space and recorded additional losses of million  allocated equally between general and administrative and research and development expense  on subleases to provide for the loss on the sublease rentals and vacant space 
investment income decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in investment income included realized gains on sales of marketable securities of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investment income  excluding the gains on the sale of investments  decreased in these years primarily due to significantly lower investment rates of return 
we expect lower investment income in compared with due to lower investment balances 
interest expense was million in  compared with million in and indebtedness for capital leases was higher in each year compared to the prior year  however  in lower outstanding balances on bank debt and lower interest rates offset this increase compared with interest expense is expected to increase in due to higher capital lease obligations incurred mostly in related to the increased capital spending principally for pcc 
for  we reported a net loss of million  or per share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for net loss for included a million write down of our investment in vgi  and net loss for included a million write down of this investment 
excluding the impact of these write downs  the loss was higher primarily because the decline in investment income more than offset the increase in revenues in net loss for was million or per share 
net loss for was higher than for due to lower revenues  higher expenses  the write down of our vgi investment and lower investment income  as explained above 
other matters since inception  we estimate that we have spent approximately million on research and development 
approximately million of this amount was for our two cancer programs  allovectin  which is currently in a high dose phase trial in melanoma  but for which we have elected not to proceed with a bla filing for a low dose based on low dose clinical trial results  and leuvectin  for which development was discontinued in september due to other priorities 
we expect the high dose phase trial to determine whether higher dosing will provide the level of efficacy needed to support further development 
from inception  we have spent about million in our allovectin program 
if future trials are needed  this would add to the time and cost of development 
from inception  we have spent approximately million in our leuvectin program 
from inception  we have spent approximately million on our malaria program 
additionally  we are in the early stages of research and development of vaccine candidates for infectious diseases such as cmv and anthrax 
these infectious disease candidates will require significant costs to advance through the development stages 
see product development cancer therapies allovectin for a more detailed explanation of the status of allovectin 
see also product development dna vaccines for infectious diseases cytomegalovirus and anthrax for more detailed discussions of our cmv and anthrax vaccine programs 
costs incurred by major program for each of the three years in the period ended december   were as follows in thousands allovectin leuvectin anthrax cmv malaria other research and development  and technology enhancements total r d spending we have several other product candidates in the research stage 
it can take many years from the initial decision to screen product candidates  perform preclinical and safety studies  and perform clinical trials leading up to possible fda approval of a product 
the outcome of the research is unknown until each stage of the testing is completed  up through and including the registration clinical trials 
accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and cost to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have a product approved by the fda 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common stock and preferred stock  public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  compared with million at december  cash and marketable securities  including restricted securities  totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  cash used in operating activities increased to million for  compared with million in due to cash payments resulting in a decrease in the outstanding balance of accounts payable primarily related to construction payments  and increased prepayments on manufacturing contracts  partially offset by reimbursement of certain construction costs by our landlord and collection of interest receivable 
cash used to acquire other assets was lower in than in the corresponding period in because of the rent deposit we paid on our new facility in net loss for both and  also included noncash write downs of our investment in vgi  now corautus  as more fully explained under results of operations above 
cash used in operating activities increased to million in compared with million in  principally due to a higher net loss  and an increase in receivables and other assets 
these increases more than offset the positive cash flow from the increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  accrued level rent adjustment  and non cash charges such as depreciation 
net loss for included a non cash write down of our investment in vgi 
in addition we recorded an expense of million for the difference between our remaining lease obligations and the amounts we expect to recover by subleasing the vacated space in our older facilities  including a million write down of the unamortized balance of leasehold improvements 
cash provided from investing activities was million for  compared with million in in  our net sales of marketable securities yielded million of cash compared with net sales of million in in  we also sold restricted marketable securities and purchased restricted cash equivalents that are used as collateral to support a letter of credit 
capital expenditures for increased from the same period in the prior year due to capital purchases for  and improvements to  our new facility 
additionally  spending for licensed technology and patents increased from the same period in the prior year 
cash provided from investing activities was million in compared with million in net sales of securities were lower in because in we sold marketable securities and invested in cash equivalents of a shorter term 
in  we also paid million for a license to certain technology 
capital expenditures were higher in because we borrowed under a financing agreement to expand the research facility 
in  most of the cash expenditures for pcc were funded by the landlord as part of the tenant improvement allowance provided in the lease agreement 
cash used in financing activities in was million compared with million for the same period in payments on capital lease obligations for increased compared with due to higher balances of capital lease obligations 
cash used in financing activities in was million compared with cash provided from financing activities of million in the increased use of cash in compared with was primarily a result of having no proceeds from notes payable in compared with million of proceeds from notes payable in an increase in payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations in compared with also contributed to the increase in cash used in financing activities 
to finance certain leasehold improvements we borrowed from a bank million in this borrowing converted to a term loan payable over months in june the term loan bears interest approximating the bank s prime rate 
at december   outstanding borrowings under the term loan were million  at an interest rate of percent 
in  we expect that our total net cash used may differ from our projected net loss principally because of timing of cash receipts on certain contract work 
capital equipment spending  including amounts financed under capital leases  is expected to be lower in compared with because we completed most of our capital improvements to the pcc facility in in december  we received a commitment letter from the leasing division of a bank to provide us with up to million of financing for tenant improvements and equipment 
we have accepted the terms of this commitment letter subject to completing final lease documentation 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses  including continued increases in personnel costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical testing  outside services  facilities  intellectual property and possible commercialization costs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the impact of competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and possible commercialization activities and arrangements 
we may seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings 
in december  a shelf registration statement that we filed with the sec was declared effective  which will allow us to issue from time to time an aggregate of up to million of common stock or preferred stock 
we cannot assure that additional financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we anticipate that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our operating needs through at least we do not utilize special purpose entities for any transactions 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations  including all off balance sheet arrangements  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are not presented in this table because they are already reflected in operating lease commitments  or do not require cash settlement in the future 
in addition  we have undertaken certain commitments under agreements with collaborators  and our officers and directors 
under the license agreements with our collaborators  we have agreed to continue to maintain and defend the patent rights licensed to the collaborators 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors which would indemnify those individuals for any expenses and liabilities in the event of a threatened  pending or actual investigation  lawsuit  or criminal or investigative proceeding 
under employment agreements with four of our officers  we are also obligated to pay salary continuation if we terminate an officer s employment without cause  or if an officer resigns for good reason  as defined in the agreements 
we would continue to pay at the current base compensation rate  or current base compensation rate plus the prior year s cash bonus in the case of the ceo  for the period specified in each agreement  which ranges from six to twelve months 
these agreements also specify that any earnings from employment or consulting during this period will offset any salary continuation payments due from us 
total payments due under these employment agreements would have been million at december  critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas intangible assets 
we capitalize the license fees we pay to acquire access to proprietary technology if the technology is expected to have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
the cost of licensed technology rights is amortized to expense over the estimated average useful life of the technology  which is generally ten years 
we also capitalize certain costs related to patent applications 
accumulated costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the patent  which is generally years and usually commences at the time the patent application is filed 
costs related to patent applications are written off to expense at the time such costs are deemed to have no continuing value 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
we review long lived assets and intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the total amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
if assets are to be disposed of  they are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
loss of legal ownership or rights to patents or licensed technology  or significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  among other things  could give rise to asset impairment 
deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
this valuation allowance reduces the gross deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable 
we considered projections of future taxable income  past operating results and tax planning strategies in making this determination 
clinical trial expenses 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and accruing this total cost for the patient over the estimated treatment period  which corresponds with the period over which the services are performed  beginning when the patient enrolls in the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and other external expenses related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  the method of administration of the treatment  and the number of treatments for each patient 
treatment periods vary depending on the clinical trial 
we make revisions to the clinical trial cost estimates as clinical trials progress 
clinical trial expense was million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
no material revisions to the estimates were made in the periods presented 
accruals for potential disallowed costs on contracts 
we have contracts with agencies of the us government under which we bill for direct and indirect costs incurred 
these billed costs are subject to audit by government agencies  such as the nih 
we have established accruals of approximately million at december   to provide for potential disallowed costs 
in the event that the final costs allowed are different from what we have estimated  we may need to make a change in our estimated accrual  which could also affect our results of operations and cash flow 
no material adjustments were made to the accruals in the periods presented 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from licensing our proprietary technology and by performing services under research and development contracts and grants  and service contracts 
in general  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determined  and collection is reasonably assured 
any initial license or option payment received under an agreement under which we also provide research and development services is recognized as revenue over the term of the research and development period 
payments for options on a license to our technology are recognized as revenue over the option period 
fees paid to extend an option are recognized as revenue over the option extension period 
upfront license payments are recognized as revenue upon contract signing if the fee is nonrefundable and noncreditable  and if there are no significant performance obligations remaining 
revenue from milestones is recognized as agreed upon events representing the achievement of substantive steps in the development process are achieved  or the passage of time  and where the amount of the milestone payment approximates the value of achieving the milestone  and collection of payment is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recognized as the cash is received from the licensee 
revenue under research and development contracts and grants  and manufacturing and regulatory service contracts  except for fixed price contracts  is recognized as the research and development expenses for services performed are incurred  provided that all of the revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
we do not recognize revenue on contract change orders until the service is performed and we have a signed modification for additional funding for the contract 
prior to that time  any costs incurred for change orders on contracts are deferred if it is highly probable that we will receive a signed modification  or if we have received a signed modification  increasing the funding under the contract which will allow us to recover the costs incurred 
otherwise  the costs are expensed as incurred 
once the signed modification for additional funding is received  the deferred costs and any related revenue are both recognized 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
we also have entered into fixed price manufacturing contracts under which the primary deliverables are investigational vaccines to be used for preclinical and clinical research 
under these contracts  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped  and any deferred manufacturing costs are recognized as expense at that time 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb revised the approach for emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting under arrangements where a company will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on when and how an arrangement should be divided into a separate unit of accounting  and when and how much revenue can be recognized on the different units delivered in particular to license  research and development and contract manufacturing agreements often entered into by companies in the biotechnology industry 
we have entered into fixed price manufacturing contracts which we believe would qualify for multiple element accounting under eitf issue no 
in certain cases  this might allow us to recognize a portion of the revenue before all of the multiple elements are delivered 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the provisions of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  in december  the staff of the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition  which superseded sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and became effective upon issuance 
sab rescinded the accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of the aforementioned eitf sab also rescinded the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
sab incorporates the guidance on revenue recognition under eitf  however  the basic revenue recognition principles of sab remain substantially the same under sab  which was effective upon issuance 
our adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin would require us to record as a liability on our balance sheet any guarantees upon the issuance of such guarantees or indemnification 
additionally  fin requires disclosures about such guarantees 
the initial recognition and initial measurement of guarantees is effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions are applicable for financial statements for interim or annual periods ended after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
fin applies immediately to variable interest in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest in variable interest entities obtained after january  fin requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january   if it is reasonably possible that the company will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when fin becomes effective 
the application of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which supercedes fin the application of the revised interpretation is required in the financial statements of companies that have interests in special purpose entities for periods after december  the application of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
we have provided the required disclosure in note of the notes to financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
our investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the average maturity of our non equity investments is approximately nine months 
our investments are all classified as available for sale securities 
beginning march   marketable securities also included our investment in common stock of corautus 
any subsequent change in the fair value of the corautus shares we own  based on the market price of the listed shares  is reflected as an unrealized gain or loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet at the end of each quarter  provided any reduction in value is not due to impairment which is other than temporary 
see note of the notes to financial statements for further details 
to assess our interest rate risk  we performed a sensitivity analysis projecting an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using the following assumptions a month time horizon  a month average maturity and a basis point increase in interest rates 
this pro forma fair value would have been million lower than the reported fair value of our non equity investments at december  at december   our unrealized gain on marketable securities was million  including an unrealized gain of million on our investment in corautus 
we expect lower investment income in compared with due to lower investment balances 
the fair market value of floating interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of floating interest rate debt will vary as interest rates increase or decrease 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments outstanding at december   and december   we believe that there were no material market risk exposures to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such dates
