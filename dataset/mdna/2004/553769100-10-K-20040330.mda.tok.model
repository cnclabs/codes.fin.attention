unless stated otherwise  references to total revenues  revenues and gross profit are before deducting promotional allowances 
overview through subsidiaries  we own and operate the mountaineer racetrack gaming resort in chester  west virginia  scioto downs  inc in columbus  ohio  and the ramada inn and speedway casino in north las vegas  nevada 
as a result of declining operating performance  we sold the speakeasy casino in reno  nevada in march effective march  we acquired the assets of binion s horseshoe hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada binion s and entered into a joint operating license agreement with an affiliate of harrah s entertainment  inc pursuant to which harrah s will serve as the primary day to day operator of the property on an interim basis 
although we have expanded our operations  since acquiring mountaineer park in  mountaineer park has been the focus of our business operations and we expect mountaineer park to continue to account for the majority of our revenues  profits and cash flows for the foreseeable future 
the company s business strategy involves further developing operations at mountaineer park as a destination resort and convention facility  increasing our machine count as patron demand dictates and continuing the growth of mountaineer park s export simulcast business 
additionally  the company has and will continue to seek other parimutuel businesses and or gaming concerns that fit strategically with our existing operations 
we also intend to pursue legislation that will permit additional forms of gaming in the jurisdictions in which we own or seek to acquire properties 
for fiscal  total revenues increased to million from million in  while ebitda grew by to million from million in increased patronage at mountaineer resulting from expanded operations and the july  acquisition of scioto downs positively influenced revenues  and the sale of the reno property in march of reduced revenues 
increased revenues  changes in marketing strategy and operational efficiencies contributed to the increase in ebitda 
investments in infrastructure and amenities at mountaineer park  which allow us to provide our patrons a higher quality  diversified gaming and entertainment experience  have and will continue to drive growth in our revenues and ebitda 
total revenues at mountaineer park increased to million from million in  while ebitda increased to million from million in this growth is reflective of increases in revenues for all revenue reporting classifications and is the result of expanded operations construction of hotel and amenities completed in may  maturing of the business associated with the new amenities  marketing awareness campaigns to promote mountaineer park as a destination hotel  convention and resort facility and certain operating efficiencies 
revenues from gaming operations at mountaineer park increased to million  generating a net win per day per machine of based on an average of  machines  compared to with an average of  machines in because of the increase in average number of gaming machines that were installed to address peak demand times on weekends and holidays  management does not view the decrease in daily net win per machine as a negative trend in slot revenue 
to the contrary  management is encouraged by the increase in slot revenue 
mountaineer park has received the approval to install up to a total of  machines and will increase the machine count as patron demand dictates 
parimutuel commissions at mountaineer park increased million to million for this increase reflects the million net increase in export simulcast revenues due to an increase in the number of sites receiving the mountaineer park signal and growing familiarity with the mountaineer park racing product 
management believes that the increase in machine count  continuing efforts to increase the sites receiving mountaineer park s export signal  ongoing targeted and awareness marketing campaigns to promote mountaineer park as a destination hotel  convention and resort facility and increases in patron traffic will allow this upward trend in revenue growth to continue 
however  this growth can be impacted by  among other things  the introduction of new competition as a result of gaming legislation in neighboring states and changes in west virginia video lottery legislation 
as part of our business strategy and in order to leverage our expertise and capitalize on new development opportunities  we have expanded our racing operations to ohio and plan to expand into pennsylvania where we have a license to build a new thoroughbred track  minnesota where we have a letter of intent to acquire a interest in an entity that has applied for license to build a new harness track in the minneapolis metropolitan area  and other states as opportunities arise 
in the event these states enact new gaming laws  like those in west virginia that permit slot machines at racetracks  we would expect our racing facilities in these states to benefit greatly from the addition of slot machines 
on july  we completed the acquisition of scioto downs  inc  which owns and operates a harness horse racing facility with parimutuel wagering in columbus  ohio 
total consideration for the purchase was approximately million and we utilized cash on hand derived principally from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in march scioto downs contributed revenues of million and incurred an ebitda loss of  during the five months of subsequent to the acquisition date 
we are currently incorporating  where possible  scioto downs into certain mountaineer park simulcasting arrangements 
additionally  we are investigating other ways to increase revenues for scioto downs including telephone wagering  however  nothing definitive has been established at this time 
we have also obtained a license to build a new thoroughbred horse racetrack with parimutuel wagering in erie  pennsylvania 
in addition to the acre site on route which we have under option for approximately million the licensed site  we subsequently identified two alternative sites that were not available when we applied for our license 
we have purchased for million a acre site known as the green shingle  which is improved with acres of paved parking lots and several buildings 
in march of  through an agent  we executed a purchase agreement  subject to our due diligence investigation  for a third site  known as the international paper site  comprised of approximately acres on lake erie 
the purchase price would be million 
apart from land acquisition costs  closing costs  and costs for gaming equipment  we anticipate spending between million and million to build presque isle downs  depending upon site selection and whether pennsylvania passes legislation permitting slot machines at racetracks 
any change in the location for the project would require regulatory approval  which we have not yet sought 
upon commencement of parimutuel operations at presque isle downs  we have agreed to purchase an off track wagering facility from penn national gaming for million 
we expect to finance the majority of these development costs with cash flow from operations  cash on hand  availability under our million third amended and restated revolving credit facility and  if slot machines are installed  capital lease obligations 
in light of the cash used for the binion s transaction  depending upon our actual expenditures for presque isle downs and the timing of any other acquisition activity  we might require additional financing in order to implement all of our development plans 
we plan to build the new horse racetrack and commence operations as soon as practicable  subject to i the expiration of the time to appeal a recent court decision upholding the july  reinstatement of our license  or  in the alternative  favorable resolution of any appeal  ii the ability to obtain clear title to the property to which our license relates and which we currently have under option  or  in the alternative  our ability to obtain regulatory approval to relocate the project to another site we own or control which we have not yet requested  and iii other construction related risks 
see item business certain risks related to our business 
we also recently entered into a letter of intent that sets forth an agreement in principle to acquire a interest in a joint venture that is pursuing a license to construct and operate a harness racetrack and cardroom in minnesota 
the letter of intent calls for the company to invest million in the event the venture obtains the necessary regulatory licenses 
the transaction will also be subject to receipt of all required governmental approvals 
the speedway property generated revenues of million or a decrease of  from new competition with aggressive grand opening promotions impacted the operating results for we plan to implement an automated player tracking system at the property and believe that revenues will increase to at least levels 
the sale of the reno property was completed on march  the sale of the reno property had a positive impact of approximately million on our ebitda  as a result of the elimination of the reno property s negative contribution 
while the primary external growth strategy remains the pursuit of racetrack and racino opportunities  we believe the acquisition of binion s will enable us to leverage our management resources and expand within the las vegas  nevada market utilizing a strategically located landmark in downtown las vegas 
the joint operating license operating agreement provides for payments to the company over a minimum of one year and up to three years 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the payments total million for the initial one year term  and  if harrah s exercises its extension options  the greater of of ebitda or million for the second year  and the greater of of ebitda or million for each of the final six month periods 
harrah s is responsible for all of the property s operating expenses  including payroll and insurance  rental for parcels that are ground leased and for funding the necessary operating capital

the reduction in the net win retention percentages or conversely the increase in statutory payments is reflected by the company as a cost of gaming for the period during which the company generates excess net terminal income 
for mountaineer park  the threshold for excess net terminal income is fixed at approximately million  which  based upon the state s june fiscal year end  the company exceeded in mid march the amended lottery act also creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack

in march of  through an agent  we executed a purchase agreement  subject to our due diligence investigation  for a third site  known as the international paper site  comprised of approximately acres on lake erie 
the purchase price would be million 
apart from land acquisition costs  closing costs  and costs for gaming equipment  we anticipate spending between million and million to build presque isle downs  depending upon site selection and whether pennsylvania passes legislation permitting slot machines at racetracks 
any change in the location for the project would require regulatory approval  which we have not yet sought 
upon commencement of parimutuel operations at presque isle downs  we have agreed to purchase an off track wagering facility from penn national gaming for million 
we expect to finance the majority of these development costs with cash flow from operations  cash on hand availability under our million third amended and restated revolving credit facility and  if slot machines are installed  capital lease obligations 
in light of the cash used for the binion s transaction  depending upon our actual expenditures for presque isle downs and the timing of any other acquisition activity  we might require additional financing in order to implement all of our development plans 
commencement of racing and parimutuel operations in erie remains subject to risks and uncertainties  which include but are not limited to zoning  closing on the real property for the site  which is currently under option or in the case of the alternative site attempts are being made to negotiate a purchase  unforeseen title  engineering  environmental  or geological problems  work stoppages  weather interference  including floods  construction delays and other risks associated with building a racing operation  and compliance with the terms of the license concerning timing

on july   keystone downs  llc keystone downs an entity in which the company will own no more than and intends to manage through a management agreement  filed an application to build a new thoroughbred racetrack with parimutuel wagering in allegheny county  pennsylvania  northeast of pittsburgh 
keystone downs is one of several applicants for the remaining license in pennsylvania and the licensing process is expected to be highly competitive 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that keystone downs will receive a license  that it will be able to execute its plans  or that it will be profitable 
if keystone downs is successful in obtaining a license  the required investment by the company will be dependent upon several factors including the number of other investors participating in the project and their respective ownership interest  provisions of legislation if passed in pennsylvania relative to legalizing slot machines including applicable license fees  construction cost which will depend on the final architectural design and amenities to be included  and the availability and terms of project financing

the proposed track would be the second of only two racetracks permitted by law in the seven county minneapolis metropolitan area 
the company s due diligence investigation is underway  along with the negotiation of definitive agreements 
the letter of intent grants the company the exclusive right to deal with the seller and calls for the company to invest million in the event north metro harness obtains the necessary regulatory licenses 
the transaction will also be subject to receipt of all required governmental approvals 
in addition  the company is faced with certain contingencies involving litigation and environmental remediation 
these commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company believes that its cash balances  cash generated from operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet all of our currently anticipated commitments and contingencies 
management believes that except as set forth above  our cash balances  cash flow from operations  and available lines of credit will be sufficient to cover any capital required to fund maturing debt obligations and any other contemplated capital expenditures and short term funding requirements for the next twelve months 
see the section entitled business risks related to our business for a description of certain circumstances that may affect our sources of liquidity 
we may also expand our current stock repurchase plan to permit us to repurchase our common stock in amounts and at times determined by our board of directors from time to time 
although we have no current plans to do so  we may also finance our expansion  to the extent permitted under existing debt agreements  through the public or private sale of additional debt or equity securities 
we cannot provide assurance that additional financing needs  if any  will be available to the company  or if available  the terms of such financing will be on terms favorable to the company 
we also cannot assure you that estimates of our liquidity needs are accurate or that new business developments or other unforeseen events will not occur  resulting in the need to raise additional funds 
our level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness when due  and that we may not be able to meet tests and covenants of such debt agreements and achieve satisfactory resolution of such non compliance with the lenders 
in such an event  the holders of our indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness 
these actions could limit our ability to borrow additional funds and would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
a debt rating downgrade would not impact the terms of borrowings under our expected third amended and restated credit facility or the senior notes 
however  a debt rating downgrade could impact the terms of and our ability to obtain additional new financing 
additionally  changes in the regulatory environment or restriction on or prohibition of our gaming or racing operations  whether arising out of legislation or litigation  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
see section entitled business risks related to our business and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
regulation and taxes the company is subject to extensive regulation by the state of west virginia racing and lottery commissions and the nevada gaming authorities 
change in applicable laws or regulations could have a significant impact on our operations 
taxation the gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues  particularly to the states of west virginia and nevada and their counties and municipalities 
we pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations 
from time to time  federal  state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming and racing industry 
during  the west virginia department of taxation  for the first time  requested that mountaineer park pay state income taxes on income from racing and video lottery operations 
it subsequently withdrew that request 
changes in the tax laws or administration of those laws  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws 
the company believes that recorded tax balances are adequate 
outstanding options on may   pursuant to the employee stock incentive plan  the company granted to twenty four employees non qualified options to purchase a total of  shares in the company s common stock for per share  the market price on the date of grant as quoted on the nasdaq stock market

these options vest immediately and have terms of five years with respect to  and ten years for the remaining 
as of march   there were outstanding options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock 
if all such options and warrants were exercised  the company would receive proceeds of approximately million 
we utilize the treasury stock method in determining the dilutive effect of outstanding options and warrants 
our policy is as follows our basic earnings per share eps is computed as net income available to common shareholders divided by the weighed average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock options  warrants  and other convertible securities utilizing the treasury stock method 
diluted earnings per share is calculated by using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the potentially dilutive effect of these occurrences 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments made by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition video lottery and parimutuel revenues are recognized at the time the wagers are made and are net of winning payouts to patrons 
the distributions from these revenues are governed by the west virginia lottery commission and the west virginia racing commission 
after deduction of a administrative fee paid to the west virginia lottery commission  the mountaineer park receives of the first million of video lottery net win per year  based upon west virginia s fiscal year of july june net win in excess of the threshold  which is fixed by statute  is subject to a surcharge 
after reduction for the administrative fee and the surcharge  the net win percentage to be received by the company is 
we recognize the reduction in revenue occasioned by the surcharge and the reduction in the percentage of net win allocable to us during the period in which the net win exceeds the predetermined threshold 
accounting for the change in the net win percentage to be retained by the company in this manner ensures that revenue is being recognized when all services have been rendered and the amount is fixed or determinable 
the amended lottery act also creates a separate capital reinvestment fund for each racetrack to which the state will contribute of the surcharge attributable to each racetrack 
generally  for each dollar a racetrack expends on eligible capital improvements for the racetrack and adjacent property  the track will receive a dollar from the capital reinvestment fund 
depending upon the amount of a project  any amount expended in excess of the balance in the capital reinvestment fund may be carried forward three subsequent years 
we recognize amounts due from the capital reinvestment fund as qualifying capital expenditures are identified 
revenues from food and beverage are recognized at the time of sale and revenues from lodging are recognized on the date of stay 
other revenues are recorded at the time the services are rendered or sales are completed 
lodging  food and beverage gratuitously provided to customers are not recognized as revenues 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets including goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable annually effective in for goodwill 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
fair value can be estimated utilizing a number of techniques including quoted market prices  prices for comparable assets  or other valuation processes involving estimates of cash flows  multiples of earnings or revenues 
during  the company performed the annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of these tests  it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
at december   we evaluated the financial performance and the carrying value of the property and equipment at the reno property 
based upon this evaluation  we determined that the assets were impaired and wrote them down by million to estimated fair value 
in estimating fair value  we considered recent property sales  current property listings and estimates of future cash flows related to this location 
the fair value of these assets  as well as other assets  could be different using different estimates and assumptions in the valuation techniques 
the fair value at december  was reassessed based upon pending purchase offers 
we completed the sale of the reno property in at an amount that approximated its carrying value 
self insurance effective october  we began self insuring for employee health coverage 
self insurance reserves are estimated based upon our prior claims experience 
changes in the number of employees  claims expense and health care costs could cause this liability to fluctuate 
we also maintain stop loss insurance coverage for employee health care claims 
frequent players program at mountaineer members of mountaineer s frequent players program can accumulate points for wagering and other purchases that can be redeemed for tokens  lodging  food and beverage and merchandise 
based upon historical redemptions of frequent player program points  we estimate unredeemed points and record a corresponding liability 
changes in the program  increases in membership and changes in the redemption patterns of our participating patrons could cause this liability to fluctuate 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the bases used for financial reporting and income tax reporting of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance at december  because we feel that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future operations 
newly issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  and interpretation of arb no 
 fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied at the first interim or annual period ending after december  the company has not identified any variable interest entities for which consolidation under fin is appropriate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable rate long term debt arrangements 
under our current policies  we have utilized interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes for a portion of our debt arrangements 
however  with the issuance of the fixed rate long term senior notes and repayment of the balance outstanding under the second amended and restated credit agreement in march  our exposure to interest rate changes will be limited to amounts which may be outstanding under the expected million third amended and restated credit agreement see liquidity and sources of capital 
the interest rate derivative entered into in october expired on december  depending upon the amounts outstanding under the third amended and restated credit agreement and without consideration of interest rate derivatives designated as hedges if any  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual interest expense change of up to approximately  at december  the fair value of credit facilities approximates the carrying value except for the senior unsecured notes for which the fair value as determined based upon market quotes is  the carrying value of the senior unsecured notes is  at december
