item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all of our subsidiaries 
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
where the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiaries is the local currency  all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated using weighted average rates prevailing during the period 
accounts and transactions denominated in foreign currencies have been remeasured into functional currencies before translation into us dollars 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included as a component of interest income and other 
gains and losses from foreign currency translation are included as a separate component of comprehensive income 
minority interest in subsidiary represents the minority stockholders proportionate share of the net assets and the results of operations for one of our majority owned japanese subsidiaries 
sales of common stock of our subsidiary and purchases of such shares may result in changes in our proportionate share of the subsidiary s net assets 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
certain items previously reported in specific financial statement captions have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
overview in  we were still recovering from the economic downturn that began in we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million or loss per diluted share 
during the year  we lowered our cost structure  completed the transition to a balanced manufacturing strategy and continued to invest in next generation products 
as part of our transition to a balanced manufacturing strategy  we signed a definitive agreement with rohm company ltd 
rohm  a japanese company  to sell our wafer manufacturing facility in tsukuba  japan in the third quarter of and during the fourth quarter of  we finalized the sale for billion yen approximately million 
we also completed the consolidation of internal manufacturing at our gresham  oregon campus  supplemented by strategic foundry relationships 
we shipped our first rapidchip platform asic products in the fourth quarter of we have now recorded platform asic design wins with existing and new customers in all major semiconductor geographic regions including north america  europe  japan and china 
as the global semiconductor market gathers momentum  we anticipate an acceleration of our rapidchip design win activity  strengthening lsi s leadership position in the growing platform asic space 
our long term debt declined in from billion as of december  to billion as of december  the decline was the result of the issuance of our million  convertible subordinated notes due in  and the redemption repurchase of approximately million of our and convertible subordinated notes due in and  respectively 
separation of our storage systems business 
on november   we announced our intention to separate our storage systems operations lsi logic storage systems  inc storage systems and create an independent storage systems company 
we have entered into agreements to implement this separation and to address various arrangements between storage systems and us 
a more comprehensive discussion of the separation agreements is set forth in note of the notes 
on february   storage systems filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
if the initial public offering is completed as currently intended  we plan to receive the net cash proceeds from the offering from storage systems in the form of a dividend 
we may sell shares of storage systems common stock in the public market or in private transactions  which may not include the sale of a controlling interest in storage systems 
we currently intend to distribute to our stockholders  by the summer of  all remaining shares of storage systems common stock held by us at such time 
we will determine the timing  structure and all terms of the distribution taking into account factors such as market conditions 
completion of the distribution would also be contingent upon the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the internal revenue service and or a favorable opinion from our tax advisor as to the tax free nature of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes 
we are not obligated to undertake the distribution  and the distribution may not occur by the contemplated time or at all 
stock option exchange program 
on august   we filed with the securities and exchange commission an offer to exchange stock options outstanding under the equity incentive plan and the nonstatutory stock option plan for new options 
under the exchange offer  eligible employees had the opportunity to exchange eligible stock options for the promise to grant new options under the nonstatutory stock option plan 
our directors and executive officers were not eligible to participate in this program 
the exchange offer expired on september   and we accepted options to purchase an aggregate of  shares for exchange 
on march   we granted a new option that covered two shares of lsi logic common stock for every three shares covered by an option that an employee had elected to exchange 
the exercise price per share of the new options was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date 
we granted options to purchase  shares at an exercise price of per share 
the exchange program did not result in the recording of any compensation expense in the statement of operations 
significant acquisitions and other major transactions 
we are continually exploring strategic acquisitions that build upon our existing library of intellectual property  human capital and engineering talent  and increase our leadership position in the markets in which we operate 
all of our acquisitions in and were accounted for as purchases and accordingly  the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements as of the effective date of each acquisition through the end of the period 
the transactions are summarized below 
there were no significant differences between our accounting policies and those of the companies acquired 
see note of the notes 
there were no material acquisitions in on august   we finalized an asset purchase agreement with international business machines corporation ibm 
under the agreement  we acquired certain tangible and intangible assets associated with ibm s mylex business unit 
this acquisition has enhanced product offerings in the expanding entry level storage systems space within the storage systems segment and the pci raid offering in the semiconductor segment 
the details of this acquisition are summarized below in millions  except per share amounts entity name or type of technology  segment included in  description of acquired business acquisition date total purchase price type of consideration fair value of tangible net assets liabilities acquired goodwill current technology  trademarks and supply agreement ipr d deferred compensation mylex business unit of ibm  storage systems and semiconductor segments  entry level storage systems and pci raid products august cash digital video product technologies  semiconductor segment november cash during  we acquired c cube microsystems inc and certain tangible and intangible assets associated with the redundant array of independent disks  or raid  business of american megatrends  inc both these acquisitions became a part of our semiconductor segment in million  except per share amounts entity name  segment included in  description of acquired business acquisition date total purchase price type of consideration fair value of tangible net assets liabilities acquired goodwill current technology trademarks ipr d deferred compensation raid division of ami  semiconductor segment  redundant array of independent disks raid august cash million restricted common shares c cube  semiconductor segment  digital video products may million shares issued at per share  million options assumed  million warrants assumed in april  we announced a co development and foundry supply agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
tsmc 
this agreement is part of our strategy to outsource a portion of our manufacturing  that is to procure a larger portion of our wafer requirements from external sources 
as a result of our joint development efforts with tsmc we anticipate being able to defer the need to expand our manufacturing capacity for the gflx technology beyond the time when products designed for that technology would begin volume production 
we have also completed the definition of a nanometer system on a chip process platform with tsmc and its other leading edge technology customers 
this platform is designed to enable an advanced capability for the deployment of our rapidchip products and high volume standard cell asics 
these advanced process technologies allow for greater circuit density and increased functionality on a single chip 
where more than one significant factor contributed to changes in results from year to year  we have quantified such factors throughout the management s discussion analysis where practicable and useful to the discussion 
results of operations revenues year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment storage systems segment consolidated there were no significant inter segment revenues during the periods presented 
compared to total consolidated revenues for decreased million or as compared to revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the previous year 
the decline in revenues was primarily attributable to lower demand for our semiconductors sold into certain consumer product applications such as set top box  dvd playback and video games 
revenues for the communications group also declined  mainly as a result of continued weak demand for semiconductors used in applications for the wide area network wan market 
the above noted declines in revenues were partially offset by growth in revenues from semiconductors used in dvd recorders in our consumer products group  and ultra scsi and asics supplied to the disk drive industry in our storage components group 
revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase was due to a significant increase in sales to ibm  from million in to million in as a percentage of storage systems revenues  revenues from ibm increased to in from in the increase in revenues from ibm was primarily due to growth in demand for our high performance controller products and an entry level controller product introduced during the year  together with the enclosure products that are generally sold with these controllers 
in addition  this increase was due to ibm s purchases of products added to our product line pursuant to the acquisition of ibm s mylex business unit in august growth in the demand for our premium software features also contributed to an increase in revenues 
the growth in revenues for over was offset in part by a decrease in aggregate revenues of million from storagetek and the teradata division of ncr 
as a percentage of storage systems revenues  sales to these two customers decreased in as compared to we expect total consolidated revenues to decline in the first quarter of to within a range of million to million  primarily due to normal seasonality for semiconductors used in video game products within our consumer products group 
compared to total consolidated revenues for increased million or as compared to revenues for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the previous year 
communications revenues dropped significantly in due to weak demand from our telecommunications customers resulting from overcapacity in end markets 
revenues decreased slightly in the consumer product group as revenues from set top box semiconductors weakened substantially  primarily due to competitive factors  and revenue from video game semiconductors decreased slightly compared to the prior year 
the decline in the consumer group was offset in part by increased revenues from dvd and cable modem products due to growth in those markets and the benefit of a full year of revenue from c cube  which became a part of our consolidated financial statements with its acquisition in may revenues for the storage components group increased year on year mainly because of a full year of revenues from raid products  which became a part of our consolidated financial statements with the acquisition of ami s raid business in august revenues for the storage systems segment increased million or in from the increase was due to overall increased demand for modular storage products  in particular increased demand from ibm 
revenues from ibm increased to of storage systems revenues in from of revenues in we believe the growth in revenues with ibm was primarily caused by ibm increasing its sales efforts on modular storage products  including those ibm purchases from us 
revenues in also increased due to additional revenue as a result of the acquisition of ibm s mylex business unit in august our sales to storagetek also significantly increased in as compared to  which was primarily due to the consolidation of our direct sales efforts into a single master distributor agreement with storagetek during these increases also resulted from an increase in sales to the teradata division of ncr 
significant customers 
the following table summarizes the number of our significant customers  each of whom accounted for or more of our revenues  along with the percentage of revenues they individually represent on a consolidated basis and by segment year ended december  semiconductor segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment number of significant customers percentage of segment revenues consolidated number of significant customers percentage of consolidated revenues revenues by geography 
the following table summarizes our revenues by geography year ended december  in millions revenues north america asia  including japan europe total in  revenues declined in all geographic regions as compared to the decline in revenues in north america for is mainly due to the continued economic downturn in the united states 
the decline in revenues in asia  including japan  in compared to is primarily attributable to lower demand for our semiconductors used in certain consumer product applications such as dvd playback and video games 
the decline in revenues for asia  including japan  was partially offset by growth in revenues from semiconductors used in dvd recorders in our consumer products group and ultra scsi and asics supplied to the disk drive industry in our storage components group 
operating costs and expenses 
key elements of the consolidated statements of operations for the respective segments are as follows gross profit margin year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the tsukuba  japan facility to rohm  a japanese company 
the sale closed during november for billion yen approximately million 
see note of the notes 
we have now completed the consolidation of our internal manufacturing at our gresham  oregon campus  supplemented by strategic foundry relationships by acquiring wafers from foundries in other locations 
utilizing a diversity of manufacturing locations allows us to better manage our manufacturing needs  including investment in and access to world class process technology 
compared to the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the following factors were primarily attributable to the improvement in gross profit margins in as compared to lower charges for obsolete and unmarketable inventories in as compared to in the semiconductor segment  lower manufacturing variances associated primarily with yield improvements in related to our micron technology  lower compensation related costs for manufacturing in the semiconductor segment  higher sales of previously reserved inventory 
in  sales of previously reserved inventory improved gross profit margins by less than one percentage point as compared to sales of previously reserved inventory in the majority of this improvement in gross profit margin was in the semiconductor segment  a favorable change in product mix for the semiconductor segment during  and a favorable change in product mix for the storage systems segment  offset by higher compensation related costs  due to headcount increases  and higher freight costs incurred during the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment increased to from 
the gross profit margin improved in as compared to  even though semiconductor segment revenues were lower in as compared to the following factors were primarily attributable to the improvement in the semiconductor segment s gross profit margins in as compared to lower charges for obsolete and unmarketable inventories in as compared to  lower manufacturing variances associated primarily with yield improvements in related to our micron technology  lower compensation related costs for manufacturing  a favorable change in product mix during  and higher sales of previously reserved inventory 
in  sales of previously reserved inventory improved gross profit margins by less than one percentage point as compared to sales of previously reserved inventory in the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment increased to in from in the slight increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was primarily a function of product mix 
offsetting this increase were higher compensation related costs for manufacturing  due to headcount increases  and higher freight costs incurred during we expect our consolidated gross profit margin to be in the range of to in the first quarter of  compared to for the fourth quarter of compared to the consolidated gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the following factors were primarily responsible for the improvement in consolidated gross profit margins in as compared to lower additional excess inventory and related charges in both the semiconductor and storage systems segments in such total consolidated charges in were million  million lower than the additional excess inventory and related charges of million recorded in  lower manufacturing variances  due to improved capacity utilization for the semiconductor segment during  lower compensation related costs for manufacturing in both the semiconductor and storage systems segments in as compared to due to a decrease in average headcount  and increased revenues in the storage systems segment 
the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the semiconductor segment increased to from 
the following factors were primarily responsible for the improvement in gross profit margins for semiconductor segment in as compared to lower additional excess inventory and related charges of million in as compared to million in the charges were primarily associated with underutilization charges related to a partial idling of our fabrication facilities due to decreased demand  lower manufacturing variances  due to improved capacity utilization for the semiconductor segment during  and lower compensation related costs for manufacturing in as compared to as a result of a decrease in average manufacturing headcount 
gross profit margins improved  even though semiconductor segment revenues were lower in as compared to the gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment increased to in from in the following factors were primarily responsible for the improvement in gross profit margins for the storage systems segment in as compared to lower compensation related costs in due to decreases in average manufacturing headcount in as compared to as a result of restructuring actions executed in  the adverse impact in of a million charge related to the write down of excess inventory for certain cancelled product programs  decreased amortization of capitalized software development costs as a percentage of revenues  and increased revenues  resulting in lower overhead and fixed costs as a percentage of revenues 
research and development year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to research and development r d expenses  on a consolidated basis  decreased million or during as compared to r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease in r d expenses for the semiconductor segment is primarily due to benefits from the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions of to see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part because the technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra during ended in  which included a benefit of million for see note of the notes 
we develop advanced sub micron product technologies 
we continued the build out of the current generation rapidchip platform infrastructure in products utilizing rapidchip technology combine the high density  high performance and proven intellectual property benefits of cell based asics with the advantages of field programmable gate arrays fpgas  such as lower development costs and faster time to market 
we expect products utilizing rapidchip technology to have performance comparable to cell based asics at a cost significantly lower than fpgas 
markets for our rapidchip platform asic solutions will include communications  storage  industrial  and others 
our customer base for rapidchip technology encompasses a range from small start up companies to major system oems throughout all geographic markets 
we shipped our first rapidchip platform products in the fourth quarter of r d expenses for the semiconductor segment increased to of revenues in from in this is a result of lower revenues  offset in part by lower r d expenses for as compared to r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased by million or in as compared to the increase primarily resulted from our strategy to invest in r d programs to enhance the features  functionality and performance of our existing products and to add new products to our portfolio 
in particular  we incurred additional r d expenses in as a result of hiring additional r d employees in connection with our august acquisition of ibm s mylex business unit 
r d expenses as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment remained unchanged at in and compared to consolidated r d expenses decreased million or in as compared to during the same period  r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the cost cutting measures implemented as part of the restructuring actions in and see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part by the following a lower benefit of million was recorded to r d in as compared to million recorded in this benefit is associated with the technology transfer agreement entered into with silterra in malaysia during see note of the notes  continued r d expenses for the former c cube and ami raid businesses  which are a part of the semiconductor segment and included in our consolidated financial statements from may  and august   respectively  and expenditures related to continued development of advanced sub micron products and process technologies  which includes the development of rapidchip 
r d expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased to of revenues in from in this decline is a result of lower r d spending as discussed above offset in part by lower semiconductor segment revenues in as compared to r d expenses for the storage systems segment increased million or in as compared to we incurred additional research and development expenses in as a result of payment of salaries for approximately four months during of the additional former mylex employees 
r d expenses as a percentage of revenues for the storage systems segment decreased to in from in as a result of an increase in revenues offset in part by an increase in r d expenses in selling  general and administrative year ended december  in millions semiconductor segment percentage of segment revenues storage systems segment percentage of segment revenues consolidated percentage of revenues compared to consolidated selling  general and administrative referred to as sg a expenses increased million or during as compared to sg a expenses for the semiconductor segment decreased million or in as compared to the decrease for the semiconductor segment was primarily attributable to the various cost reduction measures implemented from to see note of the notes offset in part by a slight increase in compensation related costs 
for the semiconductor segment  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in this is primarily a function of lower semiconductor segment revenues  offset in part by lower sg a expenses 
sg a expenses for the storage systems segment increased million or in as compared to the increase is primarily a result of spending increases on sales and related activities to support existing channel customers and develop new channel customers 
in addition  higher revenues resulted in higher selling commissions

the decreases on a consolidated basis and for the semiconductor segment were primarily attributable to the various cost cutting measures implemented in and see note of the notes 
the decrease was offset in part by continued sg a expenses for the former c cube and ami raid businesses  which were added as part of the semiconductor segment and included in our consolidated financial statements in the second and third quarters of for the storage systems segment  sg a expenses were million in  down from million in as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses for the storage systems segment decreased to in from in the decrease is primarily a result of lower bad debt expenses of million in due to payments we collected from two customers against which we had previously taken reserves  reimbursements from a customer of million for selling expenses under our master distributor arrangement  which was entered into during the first quarter of  and higher revenues in as compared to acquired in process research and development there were no acquired in process research and development ipr d expenses in we recorded a charge of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  associated with ipr d in connection with various acquisitions 
the details for the major acquisitions  at the acquisition dates  are summarized in the table below company acquisition date ipr d discount rate revenue projections extend through dollar amounts in millions mylex unit of ibm august raid division of ami august c cube may the amounts of ipr d were determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the value of the projects identified to be in progress was generally determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated value 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenues  cost of revenues  research and development costs  selling general and administrative costs and applicable income taxes for the projects 
total revenues for the projects are expected to extend through the dates noted in the above table by acquisition 
these projections were based on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
these estimates did not account for any potential synergies realizable as a result of the acquisition and were in line with industry averages and growth estimates 
percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined based on research and development expenses incurred up to the acquisition dates as a percentage of total research and development expenses to bring the projects to technological feasibility 
discount rates 
the discount rate is used for the projects to account for the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  and the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances  which could impact the estimates described above

as of the acquisition date  the cost to complete these projects was estimated at million in and million in as of december   the projects were completed or written off 
see discussion in note of the notes 
restructuring of operations and other items  net we recorded net charges of million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december  consisting of million in charges for restructuring of operations  and a gain of million for other items 
of these charges  million was recorded in the semiconductor segment and million was included in the storage systems segment 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
has been applied to restructuring activities initiated after december  and changes the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded to the date when the liabilities are incurred 
first quarter of in february  we downsized operations and recorded million in charges for restructuring of operations and other items 
of this charge  million was associated with the semiconductor segment and million was attributable to the storage systems segment 
the charges consisted of severance and termination benefits of million for employees involved in manufacturing operations  r d and sg a  million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases primarily for real estate  and write downs of million for certain acquired intangible assets  million for capitalized software and million for fixed assets 
during the year ended december   payments related to the february restructuring actions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits and million for lease and contract terminations 
second quarter of in april  we announced a restructuring of our operations that included a reduction in workforce and the consolidation of certain non manufacturing facilities 
a charge of million was recorded in the semiconductor segment consisting of severance and termination benefits of million for employees involved in manufacturing operations  research and development  marketing  sales and administration  million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases primarily for real estate  other exit costs of million  and a write down of million for fixed assets due to impairment 
during the year ended december   payments related to the april restructuring actions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits  million for lease and contract terminations and million for other exit costs 
in june  we announced the decision to sell the tsukuba  japan manufacturing facility 
during the second quarter  a charge of million was recorded in the semiconductor segment to write down fixed assets to their fair market value 
the fair value was reclassified from property  plant and equipment to other current assets to reflect the intention to dispose of the facility within the next twelve months 
in addition  approximately million in restructuring charges were recorded in the second quarter for severance and other exit costs 
see further discussion in the third quarter below 
in june  we also recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in fair market value of assets held for sale during the period 
this write down included a reduction in the value of the colorado springs fabrication facility of million to reflect continued efforts to sell the facility 
third quarter of agreement to sell japan fabrication facility in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the tsukuba  japan manufacturing facility to rohm  a japanese company 
the sale closed during november for billion yen approximately million 
as part of the definitive agreement  we agreed to purchase a minimum amount of production wafers from rohm for a period of months following the close of the transaction 
as a result  a charge of million was recorded in cost of revenues during the third quarter of this charge is a result of the application of our policy to accrue for non cancelable inventory purchase commitments in excess of months of estimated demand 
included in the million charge to cost of revenues is a reclassification of million from restructuring expense originally recorded in the second quarter of to better reflect the terms of the definitive agreement 
also in the third quarter  million was recorded for additional severance benefits to be paid and for contract termination and other exit costs associated with the definitive agreement 
during the year ended december   payments related to the japan restructuring actions consisted of approximately million for severance and termination benefits and million for lease and contract terminations 
other third quarter restructuring actions in the third quarter of  we continued to consolidate non manufacturing facilities and recorded million for costs associated with exiting certain operating leases for real estate as the facilities ceased being used 
in september  we decided to discontinue development programs and to refocus sales and marketing efforts for certain product lines in the semiconductor segment 
as a result of an analysis of future net cash flows related to the affected product lines  it was determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the acquired intangible assets to fair market value was recorded in the third quarter of these intangible assets were originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of c cube microsystems in the second quarter of in addition  million in restructuring charges were recorded in the third quarter of these charges related to severance and termination benefits for employees primarily involved in research and development and for certain contract termination costs and fixed asset write downs due to impairment 
the severance benefits were paid during the third quarter of fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring expenses 
the reversal was primarily due to the combination of a favorable negotiation to terminate leases for real property and severance payments that were lower than expected due to the timing of the sale of the japan manufacturing facility to rohm 
an expense of million was recorded primarily to reflect the change in time value of accruals for facility lease termination costs and the write down of fixed assets due to impairment 
certain other reclassifications were made between asset decommissioning costs and other facility closure costs to reflect changes in management estimates for the remaining costs for these activities 
in december  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in fair market value of assets held for sale during the period 
we also recorded a realized gain of million on the sale of fixed assets that had been previously held for sale 
the fair value of equipment  facilities and intangible assets determined to be impaired was the result of the use of management estimates 
given that current market conditions for the sale of older fabrication facilities and related equipment may fluctuate  there can be no assurance that we will realize the current net carrying value of the assets held for sale 
we reassess the realizability of the carrying value of these assets at the end of each quarter until the assets are sold or otherwise disposed of and additional adjustments may be necessary 
assets held for sale of million and million were included as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets as of december  and december   respectively 
assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated 
we are making appropriate efforts to sell assets held for sale within the next twelve months

we recorded approximately million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million for restructuring of operations  and a gain of million for other items including the gain on sale of cdma handset product technology 
restructuring of operations and other items were primarily included in the semiconductor segment  the restructuring expense included in the storage systems segment was not significant 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets in the first quarter of  we announced a set of actions to reduce costs and streamline operations 
these actions included a worldwide reduction in workforce  downsizing our manufacturing operations in tsukuba  japan  and the decision to exit cdma handset product technology 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a restructuring charge for severance for  employees worldwide and exit costs primarily associated with cancelled contracts and operating leases 
as a result of the restructuring actions  we recorded fixed asset write downs due to impairment in the us and japan for assets to be disposed of by sale 
in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of cdma handset product technology to a third party  recognizing a net gain of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued restructuring expenses 
as a result of our decision to terminate fewer employees than the original plan contemplated in tsukuba  japan  we reversed previously accrued restructuring expenses for termination benefits including outplacement costs and certain contract termination fees of million 
this was offset by additional expense accruals of million for costs related to the previously announced closure of the colorado springs fabrication facility 
certain other reclassifications were made between lease and contract terminations and facility closure and other exit costs to reflect changes in management estimates for the remaining costs for these activities 
in september  we recorded million of additional fixed asset write downs to reflect the decrease in the fair market value of the assets during the period

we recorded approximately million in restructuring of operations and other items for the year ended december   consisting of million for restructuring of operations and million for other items 
restructuring of operations and other items were primarily included in the semiconductor segment  the restructuring expense included in the storage systems segment was not significant 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets in september  we announced the consolidation of us manufacturing operations to gresham  oregon  including the transfer of process research and development from santa clara  california to gresham  oregon 
we also announced the closure of certain assembly activities in fremont  california  which would be transferred offshore 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a restructuring charge of million  including fixed asset write downs due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions in the us  losses on operating leases for equipment and facilities  severance for employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe  japan and asia pacific  as well as other exit costs 
in april  we announced the closure of our colorado springs fabrication facility 
this facility was closed in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the facility  of which approximately million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges consisted of fixed asset write downs due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions  losses on operating leases for equipment  severance for manufacturing employees and other exit costs 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an additional million in restructuring charges primarily associated with the write down of fixed assets due to impairment as a result of the restructuring actions in the us  japan and hong kong and severance charges for employees across multiple company activities and functions in the us  europe and asia pacific 
the following table sets forth our restructuring reserves as of december   which are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet restructuring expense utilized during balance at december  in thousands write down of excess assets a lease terminations and maintenance contracts c facility closure and other exit costs c payments to employees for severance b total a amounts utilized in reflect a non cash write down of fixed assets in the us  japan and hong kong due to impairment of million and cash payments for machinery and equipment decommissioning costs of million 
the fixed asset write downs were accounted for as a reduction of the assets and did not result in a liability 
the million balance as of december  relates to machinery and equipment decommissioning costs in the us b amounts utilized represent cash payments related to the severance of  employees during the year ended december  c amounts utilized represent cash payments 
other items we recorded approximately million in other items during as follows million in charges associated with the write down of intangible assets due to impairment 
the majority of the intangible assets were originally acquired in the purchase of a division of neomagic in the second quarter of million in charges primarily consisting of the write down of an investment in a marketable equity security and related purchased intellectual property 
amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation is due to non cash deferred stock compensation recorded in connection with acquisitions 
the acquisitions for which deferred stock compensation and related amortization were recorded consisted of an acquisition in the fourth quarter of  c cube and the raid business from ami in  and datapath and syntax in no deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mylex business unit in there were no business combination transactions in we amortize deferred stock compensation ratably over the vesting period 
deferred stock compensation is adjusted to reflect the departure of any employee prior to vesting 
amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation of million  million and million was recorded in  and  respectively 
at december   the deferred stock compensation that remained was million  which is expected to be amortized over the next two years 
the balance of deferred stock compensation that remained to be amortized at december   was million 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in amortization decreased during as a result of the write down in the first quarter of million of intangible assets in the semiconductor segment and million of intangible assets in the storage systems segment 
in the third quarter of we wrote down an additional million of intangible assets originally acquired in connection with the acquisition of c cube microsystems which was added to our semiconductor segment in the second quarter of the charges were recorded in restructuring and other items  net in see note of the notes 
these decreases were offset in part by a full year of amortization for intangible assets acquired during the third and fourth quarters of amortization of intangibles decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to cessation of amortization of goodwill as of january  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  offset by the additional intangible assets and related amortization recorded in connection with two acquisitions during the second half of as discussed above  our goodwill balance of approximately million as of december  is no longer amortized  but is instead tested for impairment annually or sooner if circumstances indicate that it may no longer be recoverable 
the annual impairment test was performed at december  and it indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment review sooner than annually are discussed in the critical accounting estimates section later in this annual report on form k 
goodwill is tested for impairment by reporting unit 
our reporting units are semiconductor and storage systems 
the impairment testing is performed in a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value 
an impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if an impairment exists  as it involves measuring the actual impairment to goodwill 
we use management estimates to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
two methodologies were used to obtain the fair value for each reporting unit as of december  discounted cash flow and market multiple 
the discounted cash flow and market multiple methodologies include assumptions about future conditions within our reporting units and related industries 
these assumptions include estimates of future market size and growth  expected trends in technology  timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us  and the nature of the industry in which comparable companies and we operate 
if significant changes to these assumptions occur  goodwill could become impaired in the future 
the valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill is considered to be a critical accounting estimate to us and is discussed further later in this annual report on form k 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease is due to the repurchase redemption of million of convertible subordinated notes convertible notes during and million during the decrease from the repurchases and redemptions was partly offset by interest expense on the million of convertible notes issued on may  see note of the notes 
our interest expense continued to be below the stated coupon rate of approximately as a result of the interest rate swaps the swaps on the convertible notes entered into in the second quarter of with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into or terminate interest rate swaps 
in june  we entered into the swaps with various investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our convertible notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting treatment 
see note of the notes 
during the second quarter of  we terminated the swaps  resulting in a deferred gain of million that will be amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during as of december   a deferred gain of million was recorded as a component of the convertible notes 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase is due to additional interest expense incurred on the increased debt outstanding in due to the issuance of the million of convertible notes issued in october see note of the notes 
the increase was offset in part by a reduction in the effective interest rate payable on the convertible notes as a result of the swaps entered into in the second quarter of at december   a notional amount of million of our convertible notes was covered by the swaps 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease in interest income is mainly due to lower returns on our short term investments during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of other expenses net of million in included million in charges associated with write downs of investments in equity securities due to impairment that were considered by management to be other than temporary see note of the notes  a net loss on the redemption repurchase of convertible notes of million  and currency option premium expenses  which were offset in part by net foreign exchange gains  gains on sale of miscellaneous assets  and other expenses that were individually insignificant 
interest income and other  net  was million in as compared to million in interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income is attributable to lower returns due to the declining interest rate environment and lower invested cash balances in as compared to other expense of million in included the following a gain of million on the repurchase of a portion of the convertible notes  net of the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the convertible notes 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we repurchased and retired million of the million convertible notes issued in and million of the million convertible notes issued in effective january   we early adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections related to extinguishment of debt 
as a result  the gain on the repurchase of debt is included in interest income and other  net  in the statement of operations see note of the notes  a net write down of certain equity investments for million due to impairment considered by our management to be other than temporary 
see note of the notes  and a gain on miscellaneous asset sales  the cost of purchased option contracts  bank fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
gain on sale of equity securities during  we sold investments in certain marketable equity securities for million in the open market  realizing a pre tax gain of approximately million 
provision benefit for income taxes during  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries taxed in the us  and alternative minimum taxes 
the effect of these charges has been partially offset by the benefit of foreign tax and research and development tax credits 
in  we recorded an income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  foreign tax expense in certain jurisdictions  and reductions in the value of our deferred tax assets with the corresponding charge to income tax expense of approximately million 
the effect of these charges was partially offset by the expanded net operating loss carry back provided by a law change in  as well as the reversal of taxes previously accrued and the conclusion of a federal income tax audit with the internal revenue service for the income tax years through in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to losses of our foreign subsidiaries  which are not benefited or are benefited at lower rates  foreign tax expense in certain jurisdictions  net operating losses not currently benefited  and items related to acquisitions  which are non deductible for tax purposes 
minority interest in net income of subsidiary minority interest in net income of subsidiary was not significant for the periods presented 
the changes in minority interest were attributable to the composition of earnings and losses in one of our international affiliates for each of the respective years 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million at december   from million at december  the decrease is mainly due to net cash outflows from investing and financing activities  partially offset by cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities as described below 
working capital 
working capital decreased by million to million at december   from billion as of december  working capital declined in as a result of the following we paid million for the repurchase or redemption of convertible notes during  which was partially offset by million in cash proceeds received from the issuance of the convertible notes in the second quarter of see note of the notes  accounts receivable declined by million to million as of december  from million at december  the decrease is mainly attributable to decreased revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by million  primarily due to the termination of the interest rate swap which caused a reduction in the related interest receivable see note of the notes and a lower balance of assets held for sale due to sales and write downs of assets  net of additions see note of the notes  accounts payable increased by million due to timing of payments  accrued salaries  wages and benefits increased by million due to timing differences in payment of salaries and bonuses  and income taxes payable increased by million due to the timing of tax payments made and the income tax provision recorded in the decrease in working capital was offset  in part  by the following inventories increased by million  primarily as a result of decreased revenues  offset in part by decreased production in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities increased by million due to changes in underlying temporary differences see note of the notes  and other accrued liabilities decreased by million mainly due to a reduction in interest payable primarily due to the timing of interest payments and the reduction in the balance of outstanding convertible notes  offset in part by higher restructuring reserves see note of the notes 
cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities 
during  we generated million of net cash and cash equivalents from operating activities compared to million generated in cash and cash equivalents generated from operating activities for the year ended december  were the result of the following higher net changes in assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  offset by lower income before depreciation and amortization  non cash restructuring and other items  amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation acquired in process r d  provision for inventories and losses on write downs of equity securities  net of gain on sales over the two periods presented 
the non cash items and other non operating adjustments are quantified in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in this current report on form k  changes in working capital components from december  as compared to december  as discussed above  and cash of million  which was received upon termination of the swaps during the second quarter of see note of the notes 
the fair value of the swap was formerly included in other non current assets 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during were million as compared to million used in the primary investing activities or changes during were as follows purchases of debt and equity securities available for sale  net of sales and maturities in  proceeds of million from the sale leaseback transaction entered into during the first quarter of see note of the notes  proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and the sale of the japan manufacturing facility to rohm see note of the notes  purchases of property and equipment during  and higher non current assets and deposits in  primarily as a result of the new lease agreement entered into during the first quarter of see note of the notes 
capital additions were million in as compared to million in we believe that maintaining technological leadership in the highly competitive worldwide semiconductor manufacturing industry requires access to additional advanced manufacturing capacity 
our focus is on establishing strategic supplier alliances with foundry semiconductor manufacturers  which enables us to have access to advanced manufacturing capacity  and reduces our capital spending requirements 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents used in financing activities during were million as compared to million in the increase is primarily attributable to cash paid to redeem repurchase the and convertible notes  partially offset by cash proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes  accompanied by lower cash proceeds from issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and purchase plans in as compared to on may   we issued million of convertible subordinated notes the convertible notes due in we paid approximately million for debt issuance costs that are being amortized using the interest method see note of the notes 
approximately million of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes were used to purchase call spread options on lsi s common stock the call spread options 
the call spread options  including fees and costs have been accounted for as capital transactions in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
the call spread options cover approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares that are initially issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes in full 
the call spread options are designed to mitigate dilution from conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market price per share of our common stock upon exercise of the call spread options is greater than and is less than or equal to 
the call spread options may be settled at our option in either net shares or in cash and expire in the proceeds from the convertible notes were used to repurchase million of the convertible notes and million of the convertible notes during the second quarter of a net pre tax loss of million was recognized  in interest income and other  net  on the repurchases of the and convertible notes 
the pre tax loss is net of the write off of debt issuance costs and a portion of the deferred gain on the terminated swaps see note of the notes 
on september   we redeemed the balance of the convertible notes that were outstanding on that date see note of the notes 
cash of million was paid to redeem the remaining convertible notes at a total redemption price of  per  principal amount of the notes consisting of  principal amount plus accrued interest of 
a net pre tax loss of million was recognized  in interest income and other  net  on the redemption of the convertible notes 
the pre tax loss is net of the write off of debt issuance costs and the remaining deferred gain on the terminated swap see note of the notes 
on december   we redeemed the balance of the convertible notes that were outstanding on that date 
cash of million was paid to redeem the remaining convertible notes at a total redemption price of per  principal amount of notes  consisting of  principal plus interest of 
a net pre tax loss of approximately million was recognized  in interest income and other  net  on the redemption of the convertible notes 
the pre tax loss is net of the write off of debt issuance costs and the remaining deferred gain on the terminated swap see note and of the notes 
it is our policy to reinvest our earnings and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to stockholders in the foreseeable future 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  combined with funds from such financing and our ability to borrow funds  will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms 
moreover  any future equity or convertible debt financing will decrease the percentage of equity ownership of existing stockholders and may result in dilution  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted 
on february   storage systems filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
if the initial public offering is completed as currently intended  we plan to receive the net cash proceeds from the offering from storage systems in the form of a dividend 
we may sell shares of storage systems common stock in the public market or in private transactions  which may not include the sale of a controlling interest in storage systems 
we currently intend to distribute to our stockholders  by the summer of  all remaining shares of storage systems common stock held by us at such time 
we will determine the timing  structure and all terms of the distribution taking into account factors such as market conditions 
completion of the distribution would also be contingent upon the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from the internal revenue service and or a favorable opinion from our tax advisor as to the tax free nature of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes 
we are not obligated to undertake the distribution  and the distribution may not occur by the contemplated time or at all 
we do not expect our operating cash flows to be materially affected in periods subsequent to the distribution 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in millions convertible subordinated notes operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase commitments total convertible subordinated notes as of december   we have million of convertible notes due in november convertible notes and million of the convertible notes due in may all of the convertible notes are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt  are convertible at the holder s option  at any time prior to the maturity date of the convertible notes  into shares of our common stock 
the and convertible notes have conversion prices of approximately per share and per share  respectively 
the convertible notes are convertible at the holder s option  at any time after days following issuance  into shares of our company s common stock 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on at least days notice at any time on or after the call date  which is two years before the due date 
we cannot elect to redeem the convertible notes prior to maturity 
each holder of the and convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon the occurrence of any fundamental change  which includes a transaction or event such as an exchange offer  liquidation  tender offer  consolidation  merger or combination 
interest is payable semiannually 
fluctuations in our stock price impact the prices of our outstanding convertible securities and the likelihood of the convertible securities being converted into cash or equity 
if we are required to redeem any of the convertible notes for cash  it may affect our liquidity position 
however  in the event they do not convert to equity  we believe that our current cash position and expected future operating cash flows will be adequate to meet these obligations as they mature 
from time to time  we may buy back convertible notes 
operating lease obligations as of december   we had operating leases financing certain wafer fabrication equipment see note of the notes 
the debt related to these operating leases is not reflected on the balance sheet 
under these leases  we are required to maintain unrestricted cash and short term investment reserves in an amount no less than million 
we were in compliance with this requirement as of december  we guarantee residual values of equipment on these leases 
as of december   we do not expect to realize a loss on the guarantee at the end of the lease term and  accordingly  no additional rent expense has been recognized see note of the notes 
we also lease real estate  certain other equipment and software under non cancelable operating leases 
purchase commitments we maintain certain purchase commitments primarily for raw materials with suppliers and for some non production items 
purchase commitments for inventory materials are generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecasted time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
standby letters of credit in connection with the equipment operating leases described above in operating lease obligations  we entered into standby letters of credit for million which will expire at the end of the lease term 
these instruments are off balance sheet commitments to extend financial guarantees 
the fair value of the letters of credit approximates the contract amount 
at december  and  we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and million  respectively  that are in addition to the ones mentioned above entered into in conjunction with the equipment lease 
these instruments are off balance sheet commitments to extend financial guarantees for certain self insured risks  import export taxes and performance under contracts  and generally have one year terms 
the fair value of the letters of credit approximates the contract amount 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
note of the notes describes the significant accounting policies essential to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
we believe the following to be critical accounting estimates 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of our company s financial condition and results  and they require significant management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty  there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ materially from our estimates 
inventory valuation methodology 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence and unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory impairment charges create a new cost basis for inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  product life cycles  life time buys at the end of supplier product runs and a shift of production to outsourcing 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than we project or our customers fail to meet projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was approximately million and million as of december   and  respectively 
if market conditions are more favorable than expected  we could experience more favorable gross profit margins going forward as we sell inventory that was previously written down 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we operate our own wafer fabrication facilities and make significant capital expenditures to ensure that we are technologically competitive 
in addition  we have actively pursued the acquisition of businesses  which has resulted in significant goodwill and intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following i significant negative industry or economic trends  ii exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  iii current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset  or iv a significant decline in our market capitalization  for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
when we determine that there is an indicator that the carrying value of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure impairment based on estimates of future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses within our company  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
see notes and to the notes for more details on long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
valuation of residual value guarantees 
we guarantee the residual values of equipment associated with two of our operating leases 
see note of the notes 
if it becomes probable that a loss on the guarantees will occur  we would immediately recognize the deficiency as additional rent expense on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease 
in order to assess whether or not a loss has occurred  we use management estimates to estimate the residual value of the equipment 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions within our company and industry 
we test for potential loss annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the residual value of the equipment may be lower than the guaranteed residual value 
as of december   our maximum potential exposure to residual value guarantees is million 
restructuring reserves 
we have recorded reserves accruals for restructuring costs related to the restructuring of operations 
the restructuring reserves include payments to employees for severance  termination fees associated with leases and other contracts  decommissioning and selling costs associated with assets held for sale  and other costs related to the closure of facilities 
after the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
on january   the reserves have been recorded when management has approved a plan to restructure operations and a liability has been incurred rather than the date upon which management has approved and announced a plan 
the restructuring reserves are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded 
these estimates can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability was recorded 
for example  existing accruals for severance may be modified if employees are redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated  accruals for outplacement services may not be fully utilized by former employees  and severance accruals could change for statutory reasons in countries outside the united states 
accruals for facility leases under which we ceased using the benefits conveyed to us under the lease may change if market conditions for subleases change or if we later negotiate a termination of the lease 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 restructuring reserves were recorded at the time we announced a plan to exit certain activities and were based on estimates of the costs and length of time to exit those activities 
see note of the notes for a complete discussion of our restructuring actions and all related restructuring reserves by type as of december  income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
see note of the notes for more details about our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles to complex tax rules and regulations within multiple jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company s tax liabilities include estimates for all income and related taxes which the company believes are probable and which can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that the company s estimates are understated  additional charges to income tax expense would be recorded in the period in which the company determines such understatement 
if the company s income tax estimates are overstated  income tax benefits will be recognized when realized 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
sab supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf additionally  sab rescinds the sec s revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers the faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab the issuance of sab did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 application of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
this issue clarifies whether consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursement by the vendor for honoring the vendor s sales incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction of the cost of the reseller s cost of sales 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
should be applied prospectively in fiscal years beginning after december  with no early adoption or retroactive reclassification permitted 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statements of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin were to be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  in december  the fasb released a revision of fin to address various implementation issues and modify the effective date for applying the provisions of fin a public entity shall apply the provisions of the fin revision no later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after march  however  a public entity shall apply fin to entities considered to be special purpose entities no later than as of the end of the first reporting period that ends after december  on march   we entered into new operating leases to refinance the old leases 
see note of the notes 
we refinanced these leases in a manner that best met our capital financing strategy  and cost of capital objectives and the new leases are not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets or statement of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
with the objective of protecting our cash flows and earnings from the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  while minimizing the cost of capital  we may enter into or terminate interest rate swaps 
in june  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the swaps with several investment banks 
the swaps effectively converted fixed interest payments on a portion of our and convertible subordinated notes to libor based floating rates 
the swaps qualified for hedge accounting as fair value hedges  with changes in the fair value of the interest rate risk on the convertible notes being offset by changes in the fair values of the swaps recorded as a component of interest expense 
see note of the notes 
in the second quarter of  we terminated swaps with a notional amount of million 
the termination resulted in a deferred gain of million being recorded as a component of the convertible notes and is being amortized as a benefit to interest expense over the remaining term of the hedged convertible notes 
a portion of the deferred gain was written off as part of the net gain or loss on the repurchase redemption of the hedged convertible notes during as of december   a deferred gain of million remains to be amortized 
in  before termination  the difference between the changes in the fair values of the derivative and the hedged risk resulted in a benefit to interest expense of million 
the difference between the changes in the fair values of the derivative and the hedged risk resulted in a million charge that we included in interest expense in our statement of operations for the year ended december  in may  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to effectively convert the libor based floating rate interest payments on the equipment operating lease discussed in note of the notes  with an original notional amount of million  to a fixed interest rate lease swap
