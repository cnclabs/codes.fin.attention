executive overview our principal objective is to grow our business in selected markets in latin america by providing differentiated  high value wireless communications services to business customers  while improving profitability and cash flow 
we intend to continue growing our business in a measured fashion  with a primary focus on generating earnings growth and free cash flow and maintaining appropriate controls on costs and capital expenditures 
we will seek to add subscribers at rates which do not negatively impact our operating metrics 
we may also explore financially attractive opportunities to expand our network coverage in areas where we currently do not provide wireless service 
based on the low wireless penetration in our markets and our current market share in our target customer segment  we believe that we can continue our current subscriber and revenue growth trends while improving our profitability 
we believe we will be successful in meeting our objective by focusing on major business centers in key latin american markets 
we operate primarily in large urban markets in latin america that have a concentration of high usage business customers 
we target these markets because we believe they offer favorable long term growth prospects for our wireless communications services 
the cities in which we operate account for a high proportion of total economic activity in each of their respective countries and provide us with a large potential market without the need to build out nationwide wireless coverage 
we believe that there are significant opportunities for growth in these markets due to relatively low overall wireless penetration rates and the large number of target business customers 
targeting high value business customers 
we focus on high end  post paid customers  targeting primarily businesses because they value our multi function handsets and our high level of customer service 
our typical customers have between and handsets  while some of our largest customers have over handsets under contract 
we believe that our focus on these business customers is a key reason why we have a significantly higher monthly average revenue per unit than reported by our competitors 
providing differentiated services 
we are the only wireless service provider in mexico  peru and brazil that offers digital mobile telephone service and push to talk digital radio communication  fully integrated in a single wireless device in  among and throughout our service areas in each of these countries 
our unique direct connect push to talk service provides significant value to our customers by eliminating the long distance and domestic roaming fees charged by other wireless service providers  while also providing added functionality due to the near instantaneous nature of the communication and the ability to communicate on a one to many basis 
we add further value by customizing data applications that enhance the productivity of our business customers  such as vehicle and delivery tracking  order entry processing and workforce monitoring applications 
delivering superior customer service 
in addition to our unique service offerings  we seek to further differentiate ourselves by providing a higher level of customer service generally than our competitors 
we work proactively with our customers to match them with service plans offering greater perceived value 
after analyzing customer usage and expense data  we strive to minimize a customer s per minute costs while increasing his overall usage of our array of services  thereby providing higher value to our customers while increasing our monthly revenues 
this goal is also furthered by our efforts during and after the sales process to educate customers about our services  multi function handsets and rate plans 
in addition  we have implemented proactive customer retention and customer for life programs to increase customer satisfaction and retention 
we believe that many of our competitors  who have primarily lower revenue generating prepaid customer bases  do not generally offer the same level of service to customers 
selectively expanding our service areas 
we believe that we have significant opportunities to grow through selective expansion of our service into additional areas within the countries in which we currently operate 
such expansion may involve building out certain areas in which we already have spectrum  obtaining additional mhz spectrum in new areas which would enable us to expand our network service areas  and further developing our business in key urban areas along the us mexico border 
we recently initiated commercial service in tijuana  mexico bordering san diego  california this year 
in addition  we may consider selectively expanding into other latin american countries where we do not

see capital expenditures for a discussion of the factors that drive our capital spending 
foreign currency exposure nearly all of our revenues are denominated in non us currencies  although a significant portion of our capital and operating expenditures  including imported network equipment and handsets  and substantially all of our outstanding debt  are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or assets 
for example  the economic upheaval in argentina in led to the unpegging of the argentine peso to the us dollar exchange rate and the subsequent significant devaluation of the argentine peso 
as a result  we recognized significant foreign currency transaction losses in argentina in and our revenues and earnings were significantly adversely affected 
any depreciation of local currencies in the countries in which our operating companies conduct business may also result in increased costs to us for imported equipment and may  at the same time  decrease demand for our products and services in the affected markets 
additional information regarding the impact of weakening currency rates is included in the discussion of our segments under results of operations 
recent developments sale of common stock and convertible notes issuance 
in september  we sold  shares of our common stock in a public offering at a sale price of per share for net proceeds of million and privately placed million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due for net proceeds of million 
we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock to pay million in consideration for all of the million in outstanding principal  as well as million in accrued and unpaid interest  under our brazil equipment facility  resulting in a million gain 
in addition  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock and the convertible notes issuance to fund a million prepayment of our international equipment facility 
for additional information  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured debt of the company 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears and in cash on march and september of each year  beginning march   and will mature on september   when the entire principal balance of million will be due 
in addition  the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes on september of    and at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if a fundamental change or termination of trading  as defined  occurs prior to maturity  the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase all or part of the notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  at any time prior to the close of business on the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after december   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  subject to certain limitations  if the notes have been called for redemption by us  or upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events 
beginning september   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at predetermined prices 

table of contents communication towers sale leaseback 
during  in connection with a sale leaseback agreement we have with american tower corporation  our mexican operating company sold towers for total proceeds of million and our brazilian operating company sold towers for total proceeds of million 
subsequent to  our mexican operating company sold an additional towers for total proceeds of million and our brazilian operating company sold an additional towers for total proceeds of million 
as a result of provisions in the sale leaseback agreement that provide for continuing involvement by us  we accounted for these tower sales as financing arrangements and therefore did not recognize gains from the sales 
we have maintained the tower assets on our balance sheet and continue to depreciate them 
we recognized the proceeds received as financing obligations that will be repaid through monthly rent payments over years 
both the proceeds received and rent payments due are denominated in mexican pesos for the mexican transactions and in brazilian reais for the brazilian transactions 
rent payments are subject to local inflation adjustments 
to the extent that american tower leases these communication towers to third party companies  our base rent and ground rent related to the towers leased are reduced 
we recognize ground rent payments as operating expenses in cost of service and tower base rent payments as interest expense and a reduction in the financing obligation using the effective interest method 
in addition  we recognize co location rent payments made by the third party lessees to american tower as other operating revenues because we are maintaining the tower assets on our balance sheet 
during the year ended december   we recognized million in other operating revenues related to these co location lease arrangements 
on january   we executed a binding term sheet with american tower whereby both parties agreed to make certain amendments to the sale leaseback agreement with respect to the construction and or the acquisition by american tower of any new towers to be constructed or purchased by our mexican and our brazilian operating companies 
the most significant of such amendments provide for the elimination of minimum purchase and construction commitments  the establishment of new purchase commitments for the following four years  subject to certain collocation conditions  the extension for an additional four years  subject to certain conditions and limitations  of the right of american tower to market for collocation existing and new towers  and the reduction of the monthly rent payments  as well as the purchase price  of any existing towers not previously purchased or identified for purchase and of any new sites built 
acquisition of delta comunicaciones digitales 
in august  our mexican operating company purchased all of the equity interests of delta comunicaciones digitales sa de sa  an analog trunking company  for a purchase price of million  of which million was paid through december  using cash on hand 
we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price as follows million to licenses  million to customer base  million to current assets and million to other non current assets 
in addition  our mexican operating company assumed million in current liabilities 
the licenses acquired provide coverage in numerous areas of mexico  including mexico city  queretaro and leon  and are intended to help consolidate and expand our spectrum position in mexico 
we are amortizing the licenses acquired over years 
as the purchase price for this acquisition was allocated on a preliminary basis  further adjustments may be necessary  however  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
mexican telecommunications tax 
on december   the mexican congress created a new tax on the revenues of telecommunications companies  which nextel mexico has legally disputed 
in november  the mexican tax authority confirmed that nextel mexico s interconnection services were exempt from payment under the telecommunications tax 
the tax authority also stated that  in its opinion  dispatch  paging and value added services were taxable services and had no applicable exceptions 
nextel mexico continued to accrue and pay taxes related to these services 
on december   the mexican congress amended the tax on the revenues of telecommunications companies 
with respect to our interconnection services  based on guidance provided by our legal advisors  we believe such services are exempt from the telecommunications tax 
consequently  nextel 
table of contents mexico is not accruing taxes specifically related to revenue derived from such services 
however  with respect to our dispatch  paging and value added services  nextel mexico initiated a legal proceeding to dispute the telecommunications tax 
the guidance received from legal counsel in mexico related to the expected outcome of the and disputes has been inconclusive 
as part of the legal proceeding to dispute the telecommunications tax  on april  the mexican administrative district court suspended our obligation to pay the tax until the case is definitively resolved 
as a result  nextel mexico has not paid the tax  but has reserved the amounts corresponding to the tax on revenue derived from our dispatch  paging and value added services  in order to pay such amount if the court ultimately decides in favor of the government 
on october   the president of mexico issued a decree under which trunking service in mexico  including the trunking services provided by nextel mexico  is exempt from the telecommunications tax on a prospective basis beginning november  we are continuing the legal proceedings with respect to taxes on dispatch paid from january  through october  as of december   accrued expenses and other includes million of reserves related to this dispute 
the final outcome and related timing of the resolution of this dispute is uncertain 
as of january   the mexican congress repealed the telecommunications tax on a prospective basis 
income taxes 
as of december   we provided a full valuation reserve against primarily all of our net deferred tax assets as realization of the net deferred tax assets could not be sufficiently assured at that time 
we assessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets throughout our assessment considered the reversal of existing deferred tax asset balances  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and historical book and future income adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
given our limited operating history  post reorganization  we limited the analysis of future projections to one year  as a result of this assessment  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million  million and million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to certain of our operations in mexico  argentina and peru  respectively 
this reversal resulted in a consolidated deferred tax benefit of million for the year ended december  subsequent to the reversal  the respective valuation allowance balances are million in mexico  million in argentina and million in peru 
realization of any additional deferred tax assets in mexico  argentina and peru depends on continued future profitability in these markets 
our ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  the state of the telecommunications industry and other major markets  the resolution of political uncertainties  competitive pressures and other factors beyond management s control 
if our operations in mexico  argentina and peru continue to demonstrate profitability  we may record additional tax benefits for these markets during we will continue to evaluate the deferred tax asset valuation allowance balances in all of our foreign operating companies and in our us companies throughout to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves 
subsequent events convertible notes issuance 
in january  we privately placed million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which the initial purchaser exercised in full in february as a result  we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  resulting in total net proceeds of million 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears and in cash on february and august of each year  beginning august   and will mature on february   when the entire principal balance of million will be due 
in addition  the noteholders have the right to require us to repurchase the notes on february of    
table of contents and at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment  prior to the close of business on the final maturity date under any of the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of this period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes subject to certain limitations  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
we have the option to satisfy the conversion of the notes in shares of our common stock or in cash 
on or after february  we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
partial repayment of international equipment facility 
in february  we prepaid  at face value  million of the million in outstanding principal under our international equipment facility using proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible notes 
stock split 
on february   we announced a for common stock split to be effected in the form of a stock dividend that will be paid on march  for holders of record on march  tender offer for senior secured discount notes 
on march   nii holdings cayman  ltd 
nii cayman  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  retired substantially all of its million aggregate principal amount senior secured discount notes due through a cash tender offer  resulting in about a million pre tax loss 
nii cayman financed this tender offer with intercompany loans from nii holdings and cash on hand 
we used a portion of our proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes to fund these intercompany loans to nii cayman 
brazilian contingencies our brazilian operating company has received tax assessment notices from state and federal brazilian tax authorities asserting deficiencies in tax payments related primarily to value added taxes and import duties based on the classification of equipment and services 
our brazilian operating company has filed various petitions disputing these assessments 
in some cases our brazilian operating company has received favorable decisions  which are currently being appealed by the respective governmental authority 
in other cases our brazilian operating company s petitions have been denied and our brazilian operating company is currently appealing those decisions 
our brazilian operating company is also disputing certain non tax related claims 
our brazilian operating company believes it has appropriately reserved for probable losses related to tax and non tax matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for contingencies 
as a result of ongoing analysis  further consultations with external legal counsel and settlements of certain matters during  our brazilian operating company reversed million in accrued liabilities  of which million was recorded as a reduction to operating expenses 
additionally  we currently estimate the range of possible losses related to tax and non tax matters for which we have not accrued liabilities to be between million and million 
from time to time  our brazilian operating company may also receive additional tax assessment or claim notices of a similar nature 
we are continuing to evaluate the likelihood of possible losses  if any  related to all known tax and non tax contingencies 
as a result  future increases or decreases to our accrued contingencies may be necessary 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates 
the sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
for additional information see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
while our revenue recognition policy does not require the exercise of significant judgment or the use of significant estimates  we believe that our policy is significant as revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues and revenues generated from the sale of digital handsets and accessories 
service revenues primarily include fixed monthly access charges for digital mobile telephone service and digital two way radio and other services  revenues from calling party pays programs and variable charges for airtime and digital two way radio usage in excess of plan minutes and long distance charges derived from calls placed by our customers 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts 
we recognize excess usage  local  long distance and calling party pays revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
we recognize revenue from accessory sales when title and risk of loss passes upon delivery of the accessory to the customer 
we record cash received in excess of revenues earned as deferred revenues 
we bill excess usage to our customers in arrears 
in order to recognize the revenues originated from excess usage  we estimate the unbilled portion based on the usage that the handset had during the part of the month already billed  and we use this actual usage to estimate the unbilled usage for the rest of the month taking into consideration working days and seasonality 
our estimates are based on our experience in each market 
we periodically evaluate our estimation methodology and process by comparing our estimates to actual excess usage revenue billed the following month 
as a result  actual usage could differ from our estimates 
from january  through october   we recognized revenue from handset sales on a straight line basis over the expected customer relationship periods of up to four years  starting when the customer took title 
effective november   in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting in accordance with statement of position  or sop   we revised our revenue recognition policy in connection with our adoption of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
we believe that we meet the criteria contained in eitf no 
for separately accounting for sales of our handsets  namely  our handsets have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the wireless service that we provide  and delivery of wireless service is probable and substantially in our control 
as a result  we now recognize all revenue from sales and related cost of sales of handsets when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
this change did not impact our operating income for the two months ended december  or for the year ended december  and will not change operating income in future periods 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimated losses 
our methodology for determining our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable requires significant estimates 
since we have several hundred thousand accounts  it is impractible to review the collectibility of all individual accounts when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable each period 
therefore  we consider a number of factors in establishing the allowance  including historical collection experience  current economic trends  estimates of forecasted write offs  agings of the accounts receivable portfolio and other factors 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
valuation of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a review of our long lived assets requires us to make estimates of our undiscounted cash flows over several years into the future in order to determine whether our long lived assets were impaired 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we are required to make estimates of the fair value of our long lived assets in order to calculate the loss  if any  equal to the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets 
we make significant assumptions and estimates in this process regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future cash flows  remaining useful lives  discount rates and growth rates 
the resulting cash flows are computed over an extended period of time  which subjects those assumptions and estimates to an even larger degree of uncertainty 
when known and available  we also use comparable values of similar businesses in lieu of or to corroborate the results from the discounted cash flows approach  although this is generally not entirely comparable since our network technology is proprietary  not widely adopted and relies on the efforts of primarily one vendor for infrastructure  handsets  development and maintenance activities 
in conducting these valuations  we generally engage an independent third party valuation expert to review and validate our methodology and conclusions 
while we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable  different assumptions regarding these future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates could materially affect our valuations 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment 
our business is capital intensive because of our digital mobile networks 
we record at cost our digital network assets and other improvements that in management s opinion  extend the useful lives of the underlying assets  and depreciate the assets over their estimated useful lives 
our digital mobile networks are highly complex and  due to constant innovation and enhancements  certain components of the networks may lose their utility faster than anticipated 
we periodically reassess the economic life of these components and make adjustments to their expected lives after considering historical experience and capacity requirements  consulting with the vendor and assessing new product and market demands and other factors 
when these factors indicate network components may not be useful for as long as originally anticipated  we depreciate the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives 
further  the timing and deployment of any new technologies could affect the estimated remaining useful lives of our digital network assets  which could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future 
amortization of intangible assets 
we record our licenses at historical cost and amortize them using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of years 
we are amortizing the licenses that we acquired prior to our emergence from reorganization in november over to years  which was the remaining useful life of those licenses upon our emergence 
our licenses and the requirements to maintain the licenses are subject to renewal after the initial term  provided that we have complied with applicable rules and policies in each of our markets 
we intend to comply  and believe we have complied  with these rules and policies in all material respects 
however  because governmental authorities have discretion as to the grant or renewal of licenses  our licenses may not be renewed  which could have a significant impact on our estimated useful lives 
this would affect our results of operations in the future 
we amortize our customer bases over their respective estimated useful lives  generally two to three years 
we amortize the nextel tradename in each of the countries in which we operate over the 
table of contents estimated remaining useful lives of our licenses as of the date we emerged from reorganization  generally to years 
foreign currency 
results of operations for our non us subsidiaries and affiliates are translated from the designated functional currency to the us dollar using average exchange rates during the period  while assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the reporting date 
resulting gains or losses from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as other comprehensive loss income 
because average exchange rates are used to translate the operations of our non us subsidiaries  our operating companies trends may be impacted by the translation 
for example  in country us dollar based trends may be accentuated or attenuated by changes in translation rates 
the effects of changes in exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries that are of a long term investment nature are reported as part of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment in our consolidated financial statements 
we view the intercompany loans from our us subsidiaries to nextel brazil and nextel chile as of a long term investment nature 
in contrast  the effects of exchange rates associated with us dollar denominated intercompany loans to our foreign subsidiaries that are due  or for which repayment is anticipated  in the foreseeable future  are reported as foreign currency transaction losses gains  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  our determination of whether intercompany loans are of a long term investment nature can have a significant impact on the calculation of foreign currency transaction losses gains and the foreign currency translation adjustment 
loss contingencies 
we account for and disclose loss contingencies such as pending litigation and actual or possible claims and assessments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to make judgments regarding future events  including an assessment relating to the likelihood that a loss has occurred and an estimate of the amount of such loss 
in assessing loss contingencies  we often seek the assistance of legal counsel 
as a result of the significant judgment required in assessing and estimating loss contingencies  actual losses realized in future periods could differ significantly from our estimates 
reporting under chapter our consolidated financial statements for the two months ended december  and ten months ended october  included at the end of this annual report on k reflect accounting and reporting policies required by sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
these policies include the following while we were in chapter reorganization  we segregated and classified as liabilities subject to compromise in our balance sheet those liabilities and obligations whose treatment and satisfaction were dependent on the outcome of our reorganization 
if as of the date of our balance sheet there was uncertainty about whether a secured claim was under secured or impaired under our plan of reorganization  we included the entire amount of the claim in liabilities subject to compromise 
only those liabilities that were obligations of or guaranteed by nii holdings or nii holdings delaware  inc were included in liabilities subject to compromise 
amounts reported in liabilities subject to compromise during the year may vary significantly from the stated amounts of proofs of claim filed with the bankruptcy court 
we classified in reorganization items in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations all items of income  expense  gain or loss that were realized or incurred because we were in reorganization 
we expensed as incurred professional fees associated with and incurred during our reorganization and reported them as reorganization items 
we classified in reorganization items interest income earned by nii holdings or nii holdings delaware  inc that would not have been earned but for our chapter filing 
we reported interest expense incurred subsequent to our bankruptcy filing only to the extent that it would be paid during the reorganization or that it was probable as of the date of such balance sheet that it 
table of contents would be an allowed claim 
principal and interest payments could not be made on pre petition debt subject to compromise without approval from the bankruptcy court or until a plan of reorganization defining the repayment terms was confirmed 
further  the bankruptcy code generally disallowed the payment of post petition interest that accrued with respect to unsecured or under secured claims 
as a result  we did not accrue interest that as of the date of such balance sheet we did not believe would be probable of being treated as an allowed claim 
we continued to accrue interest expense related to our credit facilities with motorola credit corporation  as our plan of reorganization that was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on october  contemplated the reinstatement in full of these facilities 
consistent with sop  we applied fresh start accounting as of october  and adopted accounting principles that were required to be adopted in our financial statements within twelve months of that date 
in addition  on october   we adjusted the carrying values of our assets and liabilities to their estimated fair values in accordance with sop stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is based on the intrinsic value on the measurement date  calculated as the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the relevant exercise price 
we account for stock based compensation to non employees at fair value using a black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and other applicable accounting principles 
since compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of options rather than the intrinsic value  if we had applied sfas no 
to all stock based compensation  our results of operations would have been different 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included at the end of this annual report on form k for further information surrounding the effect of applying sfas no 
on our results of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  we use the asset and liability method under which we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities including operating losses and tax loss carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recoverable or settled 
we recognize the effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we provide a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based upon the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we assess the realizeability of our deferred tax assets on a regular basis 
our assessments generally consider several factors  including the reversal of existing deferred tax asset temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and historical and future book income adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
given our limited operating history  post reorganization  we limited the analysis of future projections that we performed in to only one year  in connection with our annual deferred tax asset assessment  we may record additional tax benefits in mexico  argentina  peru or our other markets during related to the release of valuations allowances  if appropriate  at that time 
related party transactions transactions with nextel communications  inc in connection with our emergence from chapter reorganization on november   nextel communications purchased  through a rights offering  million new notes of nii holdings cayman and  shares of the common stock that we issued  together with  shares of common stock that we issued to nextel communications in connection with the cancellation of our senior redeemable notes and in satisfaction of claims by nextel communications under our tax sharing agreement 
as a result  nextel communications owned about of our issued and outstanding shares of new common stock as of december

under this agreement  certain of our subsidiaries committed to complete the construction of our network in the baja region of mexico  in exchange for proceeds from nextel communications of million  of which million was received in each of and we recorded the million that we received as deferred revenues and expect to recognize the revenue ratably over years 
we commenced service on our network in the baja region of mexico in september as a result  during  we recognized million in revenues related to this arrangement 
tax cooperation agreement with nextel communications we had a tax sharing agreement with nextel communications  dated january   which was in effect through november  on november   we terminated the tax sharing agreement and entered into a tax cooperation agreement with nextel communications under which nextel communications and we agreed to retain  for years following the effective date of our plan of reorganization  books  records  accounting data and other information related to the preparation and filing of consolidated tax returns filed for nextel communications consolidated group

the increase in consolidated cost of service resulted in part from a million increase in consolidated service and repair costs  largely caused by costs incurred for claims submitted in connection with a new handset insurance program in mexico during and the implementation of a new program in argentina under which new handsets are provided to customers to replace damaged handsets

nextel mexico s profitability is a result of subscriber growth with increasing average revenues per subscriber and operating costs maintained in line with revenues 
additional subscriber growth was the result of selectively expanding coverage in new markets and improving network quality and capacity  including launching service in baja california and providing voice and data coverage to a busy cross border area between tijuana and san diego 
coverage expansion and network improvements were attributable to capital expenditures totaling million for the year ended december   a increase from  and a share of all capital expenditure investments that we made during  a trend that we expect will likely continue in the near future

table of contents in  nextel argentina s operations were negatively impacted by the adverse economic and political conditions existing in argentina 
at the beginning of  nextel argentina implemented a contingency plan  which included workforce reductions  the introduction of new handset leasing programs and pricing plans designed to retain customers

future capital needs and resources capital resources 
our ongoing capital resources depend on a variety of factors  including our existing cash balance  cash flows generated by our operating companies and external financial sources that may be available 
as of december   our capital resources included million of cash 
our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flows by our operating companies is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate and collect from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  including the subsidies we incur to provide handsets to both our new and existing customers  our ability to continue to grow our customer base  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
during the third quarter of  we raised million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a public offering and million in net proceeds from the private placement of convertible notes 
we used the proceeds received from these financing activities primarily to pay down long term debt 
while we plan to fund our operations using existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows for the foreseeable future  we may access the capital markets if we are able to meet our objectives of lowering our cost of capital  improving our financial flexibility and reducing our foreign currency exposure 
consistent with these objectives  in january  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due for net proceeds of million 
in addition  we granted the initial purchaser an option to purchase up to an additional million principal amount of notes  which the purchaser exercised in february  resulting in an additional million in net proceeds 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears and in cash on february and august of each year  beginning august  the notes will mature on february   unless earlier converted or redeemed by the holders or repurchased by us 
in february  we used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes to prepay  at face value  million of the million in outstanding principal under our international equipment facility 
in addition  in march  nii holdings cayman  ltd  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  completed a cash tender offer to purchase substantially all of its senior secured discount notes due nii holdings cayman  ltd 
financed the tender offer with intercompany loans from nii holdings and cash on hand 
we used a portion of our proceeds from the issuance of our convertible notes to fund these intercompany loans to nii holdings cayman  ltd 
as of december   there were no amounts available for future borrowing under our vendor credit facilities 
under an existing agreement with american tower  during we received million from tower sale leaseback transactions 
in addition  nextel brazil has a facility in place under which it can finance handset purchases 
borrowings under this facility have day maturities and interest is prepaid in us dollars at variable market rates 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the nextel brazil handset credit facility 
our international equipment facility contains numerous restrictive covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios relative to leverage  segment earnings  revenues  subscribers and 
table of contents fixed charges 
the covenants also include  among other restrictions  limitations on indebtedness  transfers  mergers  acquisitions  distributions and investments 
capital needs 
we currently anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for operating expenses relating to our digital mobile networks  capital expenditures to expand and enhance our digital mobile networks  as discussed below under capital expenditures  future spectrum purchases  debt service requirements  including tower financing obligations  cash taxes  and other general corporate expenditures 
the following table sets forth the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations determined as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the current terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see item k 
risk factors our forward looking statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current beliefs 
except as required by law  we disclaim any obligation to modify or update the information contained in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations year years years years total in thousands senior discount notes  convertible notes and credit facility towers financing obligations spectrum acquisition obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual commitments these amounts include estimated principal and interest payments based on our expectations as to future interest rates  assuming the current payment schedule 
these amounts principally include future lease costs  transmitter and receiver sites and switches and office facilities as of december  these amounts represent maximum contractual purchase obligations under various agreements with our vendors 
the amounts due in more than five years include our current estimates of asset retirement obligations based on our expectations as to future retirement costs  inflation rates and timing of retirements 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures  including capitalized interest  were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in the future  we expect to finance our capital spending using cash from operations  cash on hand  cash 
table of contents from tower sale leaseback transactions and any other external financing that becomes available 
our capital spending is driven by several factors  including the construction of additional transmitter and receiver sites to increase system capacity and maintain system quality and the installation of related switching equipment in some of our existing market coverage areas  the enhancement of our digital mobile network coverage around some major market areas  the expansion of our digital mobile networks to new market areas  enhancements to our existing iden technology to increase voice capacity  and non network related information technology projects 
our future capital expenditures will be significantly affected by future technology improvements and technology choices 
in october  motorola and nextel communications announced an anticipated significant technology upgrade to the iden digital mobile network  the voice coder software upgrade 
we have implemented the network software upgrade for this technology in mexico 
we expect that this software upgrade  which requires that compatible handsets be distributed throughout the network for it to become fully operational  will significantly increase our voice capacity for interconnect calls and leverage our existing investment in infrastructure in mexico 
the voice coder is still undergoing refinement in the united states  and we do not expect to sell handsets that will operate on the new voice coder in our markets until mid in the meantime  the handsets that are designed to be compatible with the new voice coder will continue to operate on the current voice coder 
we do not expect to realize significant benefits from the operation of the voice coder until after if there are substantial delays in realizing the benefits of the voice coder  we could be required to invest additional capital in our infrastructure to satisfy our network capacity needs 
see forward looking statements 
future outlook 
we believe that our current business plan  which does not contemplate a significant expansion  will not require any additional external funding and we will be able to operate and grow our business while servicing our debt obligations 
our revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies 
we expect that if current foreign currency exchange rates do not significantly adversely change  we will continue to generate net income for the foreseeable future 
see forward looking statements 
in making our assessments of a fully funded business plan and net income  we have considered cash and cash equivalents on hand and available to fund our operations as of december  of million  expected cash flows from operations  expected cash flows from the committed communications tower sale leaseback financings  the anticipated level of capital expenditures  including a significant positive impact associated with our anticipated receipt of the contemplated iden technology upgrade from motorola  the anticipated level of spectrum acquisitions  our scheduled debt service and handset financing requirements  and cash taxes 
if our business plans change  including as a result of changes in technology  or if we decide to expand into new markets  or if economic conditions in any of our markets generally  or competitive practices in the mobile wireless telecommunications industry change materially from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our mobile wireless business  then the anticipated cash needs of our business as well as the conclusions presented herein as to the adequacy of the available sources of cash and timing on our ability to generate net income could change significantly 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently 
table of contents available sources  and could require us to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
however  our ability to seek additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of additional factors that we cannot presently predict with certainty  including the commercial success of our operations  the volatility and demand of the capital markets  and the future market prices of our securities 
e 
effect of inflation and foreign currency exchange our net assets are subject to foreign currency exchange risks since they are primarily maintained in local currencies 
additionally  all of our long term debt except for our tower financing obligations is denominated entirely in us dollars  which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risks 
nextel argentina  nextel brazil and nextel mexico conduct business in countries in which the rate of inflation has historically been significantly higher than that of the united states 
we seek to protect our earnings from inflation and possible currency devaluation by periodically adjusting the local currency prices charged by each operating company for sales of handsets and services to its customers 
while we routinely monitor our foreign currency exposure and the cost effectiveness of hedging instruments  we have not entered into any hedging transactions 
inflation is not currently a material factor affecting our business 
general operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and lease costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures 
from time to time  we may experience price changes in connection with the purchase of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  but we do not currently believe that any of these price changes will be material to our business

effect of new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during in connection with our application of fresh start accounting rules 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we record an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when we have a legal obligation in connection with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
our obligations under sfas no 
arise from certain of our leases and relate primarily to the cost of removing our equipment from such leased sites 
at the time of adoption we were not able to reasonably estimate our asset retirement obligations or the associated asset retirement costs since the settlement date of our obligations and the probability of enforcement of the remediation clauses were not determinable 
based on additional analysis that we performed during the third quarter of  we recorded million of asset retirement obligations and associated asset retirement costs under which we are legally obligated to retire tangible long lived assets 
as of december   our asset retirement obligations balance totaled million and associated asset retirement cost balance totaled million 
for the year ended december   we also incurred a related million of depreciation expense and million of accretion expense  which is included in cost of service

related to multiple element revenue arrangements  which was superceded by eitf issue no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  while a significant portion of our operations are financed in us dollars through our senior secured discount notes  our convertible notes and our international equipment facility held by nextel mexico  which is also denominated in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar expose us to foreign currency exchange risks 
these risks include potential transaction losses on certain of our us dollar denominated long term debt and the impact of translating our local currency reported earnings into us dollars when the us dollar strengthens against the local currencies of our foreign operations 
in addition  during  we entered into local currency based communication tower sale leaseback transactions in mexico and brazil  which we are accounting for as financing transactions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
due to the limited availability of long term instruments  we currently do not hedge assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies or foreign currency transactions 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the us prime rate and the six month london interbank offered rate  or libor 
these rates are used to determine the variable rates of interest that are applicable to borrowings under our international equipment facility 
interest rate changes expose our fixed rate long term borrowings to changes in fair value and expose our variable rate long term borrowings to changes in future cash flows 
in some cases  we have used derivative instruments to manage this interest rate exposure by achieving a desired proportion of fixed rate versus variable rate borrowings 

table of contents we only used derivative instruments for non trading purposes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap that hedged our exposure to variability in interest rates on our international equipment facility 
we terminated this interest rate swap in september in connection with the early extinguishment of a portion of this facility 
we do not have any derivative instruments in place as of december  other than one of the conversion features embedded in our convertible notes see note to our consolidated financial statements

the table also reflects the prepayment of million of the million in outstanding principal under our international equipment facility in january and the retirement of our senior secured discount notes as a result of the completion of a tender offer for these notes in march we determined the fair values included in this section based on quoted market prices for our senior secured discount notes and convertible notes  carrying values for our vendor credit facilities as of december  as interest rates are reset periodically  and carrying values for our tower financing obligations as interest rates were set recently when we entered into these transactions 
the changes in the fair values of our debt compared to their fair values as of december  reflect changes in applicable market conditions
