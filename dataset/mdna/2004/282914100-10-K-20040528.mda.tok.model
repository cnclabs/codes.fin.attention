item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  including our statements regarding anticipated cost savings arising from the restructuring activities implemented during fiscal  our assumptions underlying our critical accounting determinations concerning revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  allowances for deferred tax assets and reserves for legal contingencies  factors that could impact our gross margins  our cost estimates under contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method  efforts to raise additional financing  commitment of resources  and reduction in operating costs including the possible sale or cessation of certain business segments and the possible further reduction of personnel and suspension of salary increases and capital expenditures 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including our good faith assumptions being incorrect  our business expenses being greater than anticipated due to competitive factors or unanticipated development or sales costs  revenues not resulting in the manner anticipated due to a continued slow down in technology spending  particularly in the telecommunications market  our failure to generate investor interest or to sell certain of our assets or business segments 
the forward looking statements may also be impacted by the additional risks faced by us as described in this report  including those set forth under the section entitled factors that may affect future results 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunication technology for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications 
we offer the packet broadband voice over internet protocol  or voip  and video communications service  packet virtual office service and videophone equipment and services 
we shipped our first voip product in  launched our packet service in november  and launched the packet virtual office business service offering in march as of march   we had approximately  activated packet subscribers 
in fiscal substantially all of the company s revenues were generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
in late fiscal  we began to devote more of our resources to the promotion  distribution and development of the packet voice and video communications service than to our existing semiconductor business or hosted ipbx solutions business 
we completed several transactions during fiscal to license and sell technology and assets of these businesses  including the sale of our ip pbx research and development center in france  the sale of our next generation video semiconductor development effort  and the license of technology and manufacturing rights for our voip semiconductor products to other semiconductor companies 
in addition  during january  we announced the end of life of our voip semiconductor products  and began accepting last time buy orders from customers 
this change in our business has resulted in a reduction of revenues  but has enabled us to reduce costs and generate cash from the related license and sale transactions related to the semiconductor and ip pbx businesses 
we continue to own the voice and video technology related to the semiconductor and ip pbx businesses  and utilize this technology in the packet service offering and continue to sell or license this technology when the opportunity is in our best interest 
during fiscal  we completed equity financings for gross proceeds of approximately million 
as of march   we had cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash of million as compared to million at march  on april   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended 
under this registration statement  we may  from time to time  offer our common stock  preferred stock  depository shares  warrants and debt securities  which together have an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
the securities may be offered  separately or together  in separate series  in amounts  at prices and on terms to be set forth in the prospectus contained in the registration statement 
the universal shelf registration statement is intended to provide us the flexibility to raise funds from the offering of the securities  subject to market conditions and our capital needs 
any offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy such securities  if and when such offer is made  shall be pursuant to the prospectus 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to litigation and other contingencies  have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  the valuation of inventories  goodwill  income taxes  and financing operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included below under factors that may affect future results 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we defer revenue recognition of new subscriber revenue from packet until we deem that the customer has accepted the service 
new customers may terminate their service within thirty days of activation and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
as we have been providing our packet service for a limited period of time  we have not developed sufficient history to apply a return rate and reserve against new order revenue 
accordingly  we may defer new subscriber revenue for up to sixty days to ensure that the thirty day activation period has expired 
eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provision of our packet service with the accompanying desktop terminal adapter constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of eitf no 
we allocate packet revenues  including activation fees  among the desktop terminal adapter  and subscriber services 
revenues allocated to the desktop terminal adapter are recognized at the end of thirty days after activation  providing the customer does not cancel their packet service 
service revenue is recognized when the related services are provided 
at the time of each revenue transaction we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are thirty to ninety days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
if an arrangement includes acceptance criteria  revenue is not recognized until we can objectively demonstrate that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or when the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  revenue is recognized on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed below under factors that may affect future results 
collectibility of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of march   and two customers represented of our gross accounts receivable 
based upon this customer s past payment history  discussions with the customer and our review of their financial condition  the outstanding balance was considered collectible and therefore no portion of this balance was specifically reserved for at march  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which primarily consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
litigation from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending intellectual property and other litigation involving the company is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
at march   liabilities related to litigation matters were not significant 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability  if any  related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth consolidated statement of operations data for each of the years ended march    and  expressed as the percentage of our total revenues represented by each item 
cost of product revenues is presented as a percentage of product revenues and cost of license and other revenues is presented as a percentage of license and other revenues 
you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
year ended march  product revenues license and service revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of license and service revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net interest expense loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss before extraordinary gain extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt  net net loss revenues product revenues  which consist of revenues from sales of semiconductors  voip terminal adapters and videphones  were million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million from the million recorded in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to a million decline in sales of our semiconductor products  consisting of a million decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales combined with a  decrease in voip semiconductor sales 
the decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales was due to the end of life of those products and completion of final shipments of such products in the first quarter of fiscal total videoconferencing semiconductor product revenues were  and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in voip telephony semiconductor revenue was attributable to a decrease in unit shipments combined with a decrease in average selling prices asps 
revenues from system products decreased approximately  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to decreases in sales of media hubs used with our hosted ipbx product and videophone sales offset by an increase in product revenues attributable to the packet service 
product revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of  from the million reported in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to a million decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor sales  offset by a  increase in voice over internet protocol voip semiconductor sales and a  increase in sales of videophones and media hub systems 
the significant decrease in videoconferencing semiconductor revenues was due primarily to a slight decrease in unit shipments  combined with decreases in average selling prices  or asps 
the decrease in unit shipments of our videoconferencing semiconductors as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to our announcement during fiscal of the end of life of our existing videoconferencing semiconductors 
our remaining videoconferencing semiconductor customers have been designing out our products in anticipation of the end of life 
the increase in voip semiconductor sales was attributable to a significant increase in unit shipments  offset by decreases in asps 
the increase in videophone system sales was attributable to our commencement of sales of these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and as a result  fiscal includes four quarters of sales versus only one quarter of sales in fiscal the increase in media hub system revenues was attributable to the increase in licenses of our hosted ipbx product 
license and service revenues were million for the year ended march   an increase of approximately million from the million reported for fiscal license and service revenues continued to be primarily comprised of nonrecurring transactions 
in the future  with the growth of our packet service and the decline of our other licensing activities  we anticipate that these revenues will become more predictable in nature 
the increase in license and service revenues of approximately million for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the following a million increase in revenues in fiscal related to the license and sale of the technology related to our next generation video semiconductor product to leadtek as compared to revenues recognized related to the development effort in fiscal  a million increase in revenues attributable to our ip semiconductor telephony technology  primarily attributable to a july license of the audacity t and tu semiconductor products and veracity software to a single customer  and a million increase in service revenues attributable to our packet service 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in revenues associated with the june sale of our video monitoring business  a  decrease in royalties earned from a single customer under a license agreement for our mpeg video compression technology  the final royalty revenues under this license agreement were received in the first quarter of fiscal  and a decrease of  in license and maintenance revenues associated with our hosted ipbx product 
license and service revenues were million in fiscal  a decrease of million from the million recorded in fiscal license and other revenues  the majority of which are considered to be non recurring in nature  consisted primarily of technology licenses and related maintenance revenues  as well as royalties earned under such licenses 
license and other revenues for both fiscal and included approximately million of non cash revenue recognition associated with the license of our video monitoring technology to interlogix in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in royalties earned by netergy under a license agreement for certain of our video compression technology 
royalty revenue recognized under this agreement totaled  for fiscal as compared to approximately million for fiscal the licensee s obligations to pay royalties on shipments of products that incorporate our technology terminated in the first quarter of fiscal upon payment of the  a decrease of approximately million in revenues associated with our license of service creation environment sce technology to lucent and unified messaging technology to milinx  a million decrease in license revenue associated with our embedded ip telephony firmware technology  eg  veracity voip software and audacity t based reference design kits marketed by netergy  and a decrease of approximately million in non recurring license and maintenance revenues associated with our legacy videoconferencing technology 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in license and maintenance revenues associated with centile s hosted ipbx product  and approximately million of revenues recognized by netergy under a contract to develop our next generation video compression semiconductor product that is accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
profit estimates on this contract are revised periodically based on changes in facts  any loss is required to be recognized immediately 
based on our cost estimates as of march   we recognized a loss approximating  on this development contract in the quarter ended march   which has been recorded in the cost of license and other revenues line in the consolidated statements of operations 
subsequent changes in our cost estimates could require us to recognize additional losses in a future period as the revenues under this contract are fixed 
revenues from our ten largest customers in the fiscal years ended march    and accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenues 
two customers represented more than of our total revenues in each of fiscal and these customers represented and of our total revenues in fiscal and and of our total revenues in fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   three customers represented more than of our total revenues 
these customers represented   and of our total revenues 
sales to customers outside the united states represented   and  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands year ended march  united states    europe    taiwan    japan  other   cost of revenues and gross profit the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with system manufacturing  components  semiconductor wafer fabrication  system and semiconductor assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  and direct and indirect costs associated with purchasing  scheduling  and quality assurance 
gross profit from product revenues was million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
product gross margin was  and for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the million decrease in product gross profit and decrease in product margin in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the costs of desktop terminal adapters dta provided to packet subscribers upon activation 
we generally do not charge packet subscribers for the dta s when they subscribe 
in accordance with eitf  a portion of packet revenues is allocated to product revenues  but these revenues are less than the cost of the dta s 
gross profit from semiconductor sales decreased due to a decrease in total units shipped and product mix  as fiscal includes significantly less high margin video semiconductor sales than fiscal for the year ended march   we reversed  of semiconductor product inventory that had been previously written down or for which we had recorded purchase commitment reserves  and recorded  of reserves against our non ip videophone product inventory 
we also reversed approximately  of warranty reserves to cost of product revenues related to our video monitoring business as a result of a change in estimate of our warranty exposure 
the  decrease in gross profit from product revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in product revenues primarily attributable to lower asps  and a charge of approximately  for non cancelable purchase orders for ip telephony semiconductors recorded in the quarter ended march  the decreases in gross profit were partially mitigated by lower costs for our voip telephony semiconductors resulting from a change in suppliers during fiscal gross profit from license and service revenues  which were largely nonrecurring  was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
associated gross margins were   and in fiscal   and the increase in gross profit and decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the large license and sale transaction with leadtek closed during the third quarter of fiscal as described above combined with lower margins experienced on packet service revenues as compared to historical licensing transactions 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in royalty revenues that was related to the final  payment received from a single customer of our mpeg video compression technology in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due primarily to the reduction in license and service revenues  and costs incurred to perform development services under revenue generating contracts in fiscal  which included a loss approximating  in the quarter ended march  research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  system prototype design and fabrication  mask  prototype wafer  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development efforts 
research and development costs  including software development costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the following a million reduction in compensation expense for personnel primarily attributable to headcount reductions arising from the sale of centile europe sa during fiscal  closure of our united kingdom uk office in late fiscal  and the transfer of employees to leadtek research  inc in connection with the sale and license of our next generation video chip technology  a million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to the end of life of certain assets and the asset write offs recorded in fiscal  and a million reduction in expenditures attributable to the closure of our uk office in late fiscal and the sale of centile europe sa in the second quarter of fiscal  the reduction in centile europe expenses in france was partially offset by expenses attributable to x europe sarl  our new french subsidiary formed in the third quarter of fiscal the million decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the following the shift in engineering resources from research and development functions to revenue generating contracts  these costs approximated million for fiscal and were included in cost of license and other revenue  lower compensation costs due to a reduction in research and development personnel as compared to the comparable prior year period  reduced purchases of software and related maintenance contracts  reduced consulting expenses related to our sce technology  lower depreciation expense due to the retirement of assets  and our overall efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  human resources  and general management 
such costs also include advertising  sales commissions  trade show  and other marketing and promotional expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to the following a million reduction in compensation expense for personnel due to headcount reductions  which represented approximately half of the net decrease  a million reduction in facility related expenses for our headquarters due to the reduction of rent and operating expenses in the fist quarter of fiscal in connection with the extension of our lease  and a million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to the end of life of certain assets 
the decreases above were partially offset by a million increase in various other sales  general and administrative expenses including advertising  promotion and trade show expenses  legal expenditures  primarily related to intellectual property  regulatory and financing matters  and reseller commissions and credit card processing fees related to packet the million decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the following reductions in sales  marketing and administrative personnel staffing levels  and lower legal  financial reporting  corporate function  telephone  travel  corporate marketing  public relations and trade show expenditures resulting from our efforts to reduce discretionary operating costs 
amortization of intangibles amortization of goodwill and intangible assets charged to operations was  for the fiscal year ended march  amortization expense included amounts related to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisitions of u force in fiscal and odisei sa in fiscal beginning our fiscal year  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was adopted  and we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill including intangibles related to the acquisition of odisei sa that were classified as goodwill upon the adoption of sfas no 
restructuring and other charges restructuring actions during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we continued our cost reduction activities to better align expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending during the current economic downturn 
as a result of these activities  we recorded restructuring and other asset impairment charges of approximately million 
these charges included severance and benefits of approximately million  as we reduced our workforce  under voluntary and involuntary separation plans  by thirty two employees or thirty percent 
the majority of the affected employees were netergy employees based in santa clara  california and marlow  united kingdom and included employees from sales and marketing and research and development  as well as four executives of netergy 
severance of approximately  attributable to involuntary terminations was paid during the year ended march  we closed our facility in marlow  united kingdom  and recorded  of charges related to the termination of the operating leases for the facility and related services 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of  related to assets in the united kingdom that were abandoned or disposed of 
we also recorded a charge of approximately  for our remaining lease liability for office space in tempe  arizona that was vacated as a result of the restructuring actions during the fourth quarter 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also implemented a plan to reduce the workforce at our sophia antipolis  france office by ten employees or seventy percent 
this downsizing and its potential impact on our ipbx business prompted an assessment of the key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation judgments 
as a result of the analysis  we determined that an impairment charge of million was required because the estimated fair value of the goodwill was less than the book value of the goodwill that arose from the acquisition of odisei sa in fiscal the following table illustrates the charges  credits and balances of the restructuring reserves for the years ended march  and  and summarizes asset impairment charges in thousands total cash non cash liability a t cash liability at charges payments charges march  payments march  restructuring charges severance   facility related total restructuring charges   asset impairments fixed assets goodwill   total impairment charges   total restructuring and impairment charges    other income  net in fiscal   and  other income  net  was approximately   and million  respectively 
the  increase in other income  net  in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  gain recorded in the second quarter of fiscal in connection with the sale of centile europe sa  which was offset by a decrease of  related to the canadian tax credits that we collected in fiscal and recorded as other income 
the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to an approximately  decrease in interest income resulting from lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates  a  non recurring gain realized on the sale of an investment in fiscal  and a  increase in foreign exchange losses 
these decreases were offset by an increase in other income from our former canadian operations of approximately  the increase in canadian other income was primarily attributable to the collection of canadian research and development and other tax credits in fiscal  which was partially offset by a write off of  which represented the balance of the cumulative translation adjustment generated from the translation of the financial statements of our canadian subsidiary 
our canadian subsidiary has been substantially liquidated 
we collected  of canadian tax credits in fiscal  but no further refundable tax credits are expected from canada 
apart from the tax credit receipt in fiscal and investment gain in described above  other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange gains and losses 
see item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk elsewhere in this report for further discussion of our exposure to currency risk 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended march  consisted mainly of charges associated with the convertible subordinated debentures  or the debentures  that we issued in december  including the amortization of the related debt discount and debt issuance costs 
we redeemed the debentures in december provision for income taxes we had no provisions for the fiscal years ended march  and the provision of  for the year ended march  was comprised primarily of certain foreign taxes and also reflected a  refund of us federal income taxes received in fiscal at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march   and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million 
we believe that  based on a number of factors  the weight of objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets  and a full valuation allowance was recorded at march  and extraordinary gain we realized an extraordinary gain of  in the third quarter of fiscal resulting from the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated debentures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of this transaction 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents approximating million  compared to million at march  excluded from the cash balance at march   was  in restricted cash securing stand by letters of credit with certain vendors 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
cash used in operations of million in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net loss of million  adjusted for million of stock compensation expense  the  gain on the sale of centile europe and  of depreciation and amortization  a decrease in accrued compensation of  a decrease in warranty liability of  a  decrease in other accrued liabilities  and a  decrease in other assets 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventory  and a  increase in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to  of cash classified as restricted cash to support standby letters of credit with certain vendors and proceeds from the sale of fixed assets of  partially offset by the receipt of  of net proceeds from the sale of centile europe sa  and net sales of marketable equity securities and mutual funds of  cash provided by financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million of proceeds resulting from the sale of common stock i to investors in private placement transactions in july and november the private placements  ii through exercise of warrants issued in the private placements  and iii to employees through our employee stock option plans 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents approximating million  compared to million at march  cash used in operations of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the net loss of million  a  decrease in accrued compensation  a million decrease in deferred revenue  and a  increase in accounts receivable 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a  decrease in inventory and non cash items  including depreciation and amortization of million  million for the non cash portion of restructuring and asset impairment charges  and  related to the provision for inventory 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was attributable to purchases of short term investments of  and capital expenditures of  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of equipment of  cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of proceeds of  resulting from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents approximating million  compared to million at march  cash used in operations of million in fiscal reflected a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable of  a decrease in accrued compensation of  a decrease of  in other accrued liabilities  a million decrease in deferred revenue and a non cash extraordinary gain of  due to redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a  decrease in inventory  a million decrease in other current assets  and non cash items including depreciation and amortization of million 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was attributable to proceeds from the sale of an investment in marketable equity securities of  and proceeds from the sale of equipment of  partially offset by capital expenditures of  cash used in financing activities during fiscal consisted of the million payment associated with the redemption of the convertible subordinated debentures and certain costs incurred in connection with the redemption  offset partially by proceeds of  resulting from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
at march   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
these purchase commitments are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods or services 
at march   future minimum annual lease payments under noncancelable operating leases  net of sublease income  were as follows in thousands year ending march  total minimum payments we have sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations since fiscal that have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
management believes that current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our operations for the next twelve months 
however  continually evaluate our cash needs and may pursue additional equity or debt financing in order to achieve our overall business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  at a price that is acceptable to us 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
related party transactions during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold million shares of its common stock to stmicroelectronics nv stm at a purchase price of per share and received net proceeds of million 
in december  stm s representative on our board resigned and stm subsequently began to sell on the open market shares of our common stock that it was holding 
as a result  stm ceased to be a related party of the company as of december  during the first nine months of fiscal  we purchased approximately  of semiconductors from a subsidiary of stm and we paid a subsidiary of stm  for non recurring engineering services 
during fiscal  such purchases approximated  as of march   we had recorded liabilities to stm of  for semiconductor purchases and purchase commitments and engineering services 
in march  x s board of directors the board authorized us to open securities trading accounts with two brokerage firms and make investments of up to million on behalf of x  inc as directed by its then chairman  joe parkinson  chief executive officer  or chief financial officer 
since the formation of these accounts in  neither the company s chief executive officer nor chief financial officers made any trades in the investment accounts as these officers had not agreed to reimburse us for any losses incurred as a result of their trading activity 
mr 
parkinson did not have use of any of the investment account funds for his personal benefit 
the funds were always held in investment accounts in our name and all benefits belonged to us 
we invested in mutual funds  money market funds  and equity and debt securities and options of publicly traded corporations 
the investment accounts were not used to trade in our own stock 
under the arrangement  we were required to return to mr 
parkinson the amount representing the increase in value of the investment account over million to the extent required to restore replenishment payments made by mr 
parkinson in prior quarters 
through march   mr 
parkinson made cumulative replenishment payments of approximately  to offset losses incurred 
as of december   we had repaid all the replenishment payments received from mr 
parkinson during fiscal in january  the arrangement with mr 
parkinson was terminated and our securities trading accounts were closed 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 earnings per share 
eitf issue no 
addresses a number of questions regarding the computation of earnings per share eps by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when  and if  it declares dividends on its common stock 
the issue also provides further guidance in applying the two class method of calculating eps 
it clarifies what constitutes a participating security and how to apply the two class method of computing eps once it is determined that a security is participating  including how to allocate undistributed earnings to such a security 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on our computation of eps 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf no 
provides guidance on recording other than temporary impairments of cost method investments and requires additional disclosures for those investments 
the recognition and measurement guidance in eitf no 
should be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  the disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after june  and are required only for annual periods 
we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results before you invest in our common stock  you should become aware of various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this prospectus  including the documents incorporated in this prospectus by reference  before you decide whether to purchase the securities 
the risks set out below may not be exhaustive 
we have a history of losses and we are uncertain as to our future profitability 
we recorded an operating loss of approximately million for the year ended march   and we ended the period with an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we recorded operating losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future  and such losses may be substantial 
we will need to generate significant revenue growth to achieve an operating profit 
given our history of fluctuating revenues and operating losses  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve profitability on either a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile 
it may be significantly affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technical innovations  future legislation or regulation of the internet and or voice over internet protocol voip  loss of key personnel  new products or new contracts by us  our competitors or their customers  and developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general market conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and other factors which could be unrelated to  or outside our control 
the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for the common stocks of technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against the issuing company 
if our stock price is volatile  we may also be subject to such litigation 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would disrupt business and could cause a decline in our operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
the growth of our business and our future profitability depends on future packet revenue 
we continue to devote substantially all of our resources to the promotion  distribution and development of our packet service rather than to our semiconductor business 
as such  our future growth and profitability will be dependent on revenue from our packet service  as opposed to revenue from the semiconductor business  which has historically accounted for a substantial portion of the company s consolidated revenues 
semiconductor and related software revenues represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s consolidated revenues for fiscal and however  these revenues have not been sufficient to profitably operate the semiconductor business 
therefore  we have reduced the scope of these operations 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the end of life of our legacy videoconferencing semiconductor products 
in november  we sold the vip video semiconductor development effort to leadtek research  inc leadtek 
under the terms of the transaction  leadtek acquired the vip development activities  key engineers  software tools and equipment 
revenues attributable to this development effort  prior to the aforementioned transaction  were and million during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  representing approximately and of revenues of the semiconductor business and and of x s consolidated revenues for such periods 
as a result of the transfer of this development effort to leadtek  this development revenue ceased 
in january  we initiated an end of life program for our voip telephony semiconductor products  including the audacity t and tu products 
the semiconductor business remains a continuing operation and will continue to generate revenue in the future  although we expect the amounts to decrease  both on an absolute basis and as percentage of our consolidated revenues 
revenues from the hosted ipbx solutions business represented approximately and of the company s consolidated revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
in july  we sold our european subsidiary  centile europe sa  and licensed  on a non exclusive basis  our ipbx technology to the purchaser 
in march  we announced the packet virtual office service  which includes technologies previously offered as part of the hosted ipbx solutions business 
we have only been selling our packet service for a limited period and there is no guarantee that packet will gain broad market acceptance 
we have only been selling our packet service since november given our limited history with offering this service  there are many difficulties that we may encounter  including regulatory hurdles  discussed below  and other problems that we may not anticipate 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the sale of our voip telephony products and services  including our packet service  and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in generating significant revenues or achieving profitability 
if we are not able to generate significant revenues selling into the voip telephony market  our business and operating results would be seriously harmed 
the success of our packet service is dependent on the growth and public acceptance of voip telephony 
the success of our packet voice and video communications service is dependent upon future demand for voip telephony systems and services 
in order for the ip telephony market to continue to grow  several things need to occur 
telephone and cable service providers must continue to invest in the deployment of high speed broadband networks to residential and commercial customers 
voip networks must improve quality of service for real time communications  managing effects such as packet jitter  packet loss  and unreliable bandwidth  so that toll quality service can be provided 
voip telephony equipment and services must achieve a similar level of reliability that users of the public switched telephone network have come to expect from their telephone service 
voip telephony service providers must offer cost and feature benefits to their customers that are sufficient to cause the customers to switch away from traditional telephony service providers 
if any or all of these factors fail to occur  our business may not grow 
our future operating results may not follow past or expected trends due to many factors and any of these could cause our stock price to fall 
our historical operating results have fluctuated significantly and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future  and a decline in our operating results could cause our stock price to fall 
on an annual and a quarterly basis  there are a number of factors that may affect our operating results  many of which are outside our control 
these include  but are not limited to changes in market demand  the timing of customer orders  competitive market conditions  lengthy sales cycles and or regulatory approval cycles  new product introductions by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or existing products  the cost and availability of components  the mix of our customer base and sales channels  the mix of products sold  the management of inventory  the level of international sales  continued compliance with industry standards  and general economic conditions 
our gross margin is affected by a number of factors including product mix  the recognition of license and royalty revenues for which there may be little or no corresponding cost of revenues  product pricing  the allocation between international and domestic sales  the percentages of direct sales and sales to resellers  and manufacturing and component costs 
in the likely event that we encounter significant price competition in the markets for our products  we could be at a significant disadvantage compared to our competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources  and therefore may be better able to withstand an extended period of downward pricing pressure 
variations in timing of sales may cause significant fluctuations in future operating results 
delivery schedules may be deferred or canceled for a number of reasons  including changes in specific customer requirements or economic conditions 
the adverse impact of a shortfall in our revenues may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending to compensate for such shortfall 
announcements by our competitors or us of new products and technologies could cause customers to defer purchases of our existing products  which would also have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  it is likely that in some or all future periods our operating results will be below the expectations of investors  which would likely result in a significant reduction in the market price of our common stock 
the voip telephony market is subject to rapid technological change and we depend on new product introduction in order to maintain and grow our business 
voip telephony is an emerging market that is characterized by rapid changes in customer requirements  frequent introductions of new and enhanced products  and continuing and rapid technological advancement 
to compete successfully in this emerging market  we must continue to design  develop  manufacture  and sell new and enhanced voip telephony software products and services that provide increasingly higher levels of performance and reliability at lower cost 
these new and enhanced products must take advantage of technological advancements and changes  and respond to new customer requirements 
our success in designing  developing  manufacturing  and selling such products and services will depend on a variety of factors  including the identification of market demand for new products  the scalability of our voip telephony software products  product and feature selection  timely implementation of product design and development  product performance  cost effectiveness of products under development  effective manufacturing processes  and success of promotional efforts 
additionally  we may also be required to collaborate with third parties to develop our products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  and such delays will likely occur in the future 
if we are unable  due to resource constraints or technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  if such new or enhanced products do not achieve sufficient market acceptance  or if such new product introductions decrease demand for existing products  our operating results would decline and our business would not grow 
the long and variable sales and deployment cycles for our voip telephony products may cause our revenue and operating results to vary 
our packet service has lengthy sales cycles  and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort without making a sale 
a customer s decision to purchase our products often involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy product evaluation and qualification process 
we do not possess the capital required to invest in extensive marketing or advertising campaigns that may be required in order to sell these products 
in addition  the length of our sales cycles will vary depending on the type of customer to whom we are selling and the product being sold 
even after making the decision to purchase our products  our customers may deploy our products slowly 
timing of deployment can vary widely and will depend on various factors  including the size of the network deployment  the complexity of our customers network environments  our customers skill sets  the hardware and software configuration and customization necessary to deploy our products  and our customers ability to finance their purchase of our products 
as a result  it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which our customers may purchase our voip telephony products  and our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our success depends on third parties in our distribution channels 
we currently sell our products direct to consumers and through resellers  and are focusing efforts on increasing our distribution channels 
our future revenue growth will depend in large part on sales of our products through reseller and other distribution relationships 
we may not be successful in developing additional distribution relationships 
agreements with distribution partners generally provide for one time and recurring commissions based on our list prices  and do not require minimum purchases or restrict development or distribution of competitive products 
therefore  entities that distribute our products may compete with us 
in addition  distributors and resellers may not dedicate sufficient resources or give sufficient priority to selling our products 
our failure to develop new distribution channels  the loss of a distribution relationship or a decline in the efforts of a material reseller or distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we need to retain key personnel to support our products and ongoing operations 
the development and marketing of our voip products will continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel  management  and other resources 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
none of our officers or key employees are bound by employment agreements for any specific term 
the loss of the services of any of our officers or key employees could delay the development and introduction of  and negatively impact our ability to sell our products which could adversely affect our financial results and impair our growth 
we currently do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture substantially all of our products  and any delay or interruption in manufacturing by these contract manufacturers would result in delayed or reduced shipments to our customers and may harm our business 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with our contract manufacturers or our component suppliers 
there can be no assurance that our subcontract manufacturers will be able or willing to reliably manufacture our products  in volumes  on a cost effective basis or in a timely manner 
for our videophones and voip terminal adaptors and that are used with our packet service  we rely on the availability of our semiconductor products 
these devices are also sourced solely from certain overseas contract manufacturers and partners  and are currently not available from any other manufacturer 
we rely on third party network service providers to originate and terminate substantially all of our public switched telephone network calls 
our packet service depends on the availability of third party network service providers that provide telephone numbers and public switched telephone network pstn call termination and origination services for our customers 
many of these network service providers are financially affected by the downturn in the telecommunications industry and may be forced to terminate the services that we depend on 
the time to interface our technology to another network service provider  if available  and qualify this new service could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
while we believe that relations with our current service provider are good and we have a contract in place  there can be no assurance that this service provider will be able or willing to supply services to us in the future or that we will be successful in signing up alternative or additional providers 
while we believe that we could replace our current provider  if necessary  our ability to provide service to our subscribers would be impacted during this timeframe  and this could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to manage our inventory levels effectively  which may lead to inventory obsolescence that would force us to lower our prices 
our products have lead times of up to several months  and are built to forecasts that are necessarily imprecise 
because of our practice of building our products to necessarily imprecise forecasts  it is likely that  from time to time  we will have either excess or insufficient product inventory 
excess inventory levels would subject us to the risk of inventory obsolescence and the risk that our selling prices may drop below our inventory costs  while insufficient levels of inventory may negatively affect relations with customers 
for instance  our customers rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates  and any disruption in the supply of our products could result in legal action from our customers  loss of customers or harm to our ability to attract new customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if our products do not interoperate with our customers networks  orders for our products will be delayed or canceled and substantial product returns could occur  which could harm our business 
many of the potential customers for our packet service have requested that our products and services be designed to interoperate with their existing networks  each of which may have different specifications and use multiple standards 
our customers networks may contain multiple generations of products from different vendors that have been added over time as their networks have grown and evolved 
our products must interoperate with these products as well as with future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
in some cases  we may be required to modify our product designs to achieve a sale  which may result in a longer sales cycle  increased research and development expense  and reduced operating margins 
if our products do not interoperate with existing equipment or software in our customers networks  installations could be delayed  orders for our products could be canceled or our products could be returned 
this could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may have difficulty identifying the source of the problem when there is a problem in a network 
our packet service must successfully integrate with products from other vendors  such as gateways to traditional telephone systems 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether caused by our packet service or another vendor s products  may result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may force us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of some of these types of problems may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition in the markets in which we compete could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or new technologies 
if our competitors successfully introduce new products or enhance their existing products  this could reduce the sales or market acceptance of our products and services  increase price competition or make our products obsolete 
to be competitive  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing  and customer support 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments or to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive  which in turn will cause our business to suffer 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  are substantially larger  and have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing  technical  and other resources 
many also have greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers than we have 
competition in our markets may result in significant price reductions 
as a result of their greater resources  many current and potential competitors may be better able than us to initiate and withstand significant price competition or downturns in the economy 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively  and any failure to do so would harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
if we do not develop and maintain successful partnerships for voip telephony products  we may not be able to successfully market our solutions 
we are entering into new market areas and our success is partly dependent on our ability to forge new marketing and engineering partnerships 
voip telephony communication systems are extremely complex and few  if any  companies possess all the required technology components needed to build a complete end to end solution 
we will likely need to enter into partnerships to augment our development programs and to assist us in marketing complete solutions to our targeted customers 
we may not be able to develop such partnerships in the course of our product development 
even if we do establish the necessary partnerships  we may not be able to adequately capitalize on these partnerships to aid in the success of our business 
inability to protect our proprietary technology or our infringement of a third party s proprietary technology would disrupt our business 
we rely in part on trademark  copyright  and trade secret law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and abroad 
we seek to protect our software  documentation  and other written materials under trade secret and copyright law  which afford only limited protection 
we also rely in part on patent law to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we hold fifty four united states patents and have a number of united states and foreign patent applications pending 
we cannot predict whether such pending patent applications will result in issued patents 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in the united states or internationally where effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited  and competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology  duplicate our technology or design around any patent of ours 
we have in the past licensed and in the future expect to continue licensing our technology to others  many of who are located or may be located abroad 
there are no assurances that such licensees will protect our technology from misappropriation 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management time and resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
any settlement or adverse determination in such litigation would also subject us to significant liability 
there has been substantial litigation in the semiconductor  electronics  and related industries regarding intellectual property rights  and from time to time third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
our broad range of technology  including systems  digital and analog circuits  software  and semiconductors  increases the likelihood that third parties may claim infringement by us of their intellectual property rights 
if we were found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party  we could be subject to liabilities for such infringement  which could be material 
we could also be required to refrain from using  manufacturing or selling certain products or using certain processes  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
from time to time  we have received  and may continue to receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in these discussions and actions or that other actions alleging infringement by us of third party patents will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
we rely upon certain technology  including hardware and software  licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that the technology licensed by us will continue to provide competitive features and functionality or that licenses for technology currently utilized by us or other technology which we may seek to license in the future will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of  or inability to maintain existing licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions until equivalent technology or suitable alternative products could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  and could harm our business 
these licenses are on standard commercial terms made generally available by the companies providing the licenses 
the cost and terms of these licenses individually are not material to our business 
the failure of ip networks to meet the reliability and quality standards required for voice and video communications could render our products obsolete 
circuit switched telephony networks feature very high reliability  with a guaranteed quality of service 
in addition  such networks have imperceptible delay and consistently satisfactory audio quality 
emerging broadband ip networks  such as lans  wans  and the internet  or emerging last mile technologies such as cable  digital subscriber lines  and wireless local loop  may not be suitable for telephony unless such networks and technologies can provide reliability and quality consistent with these standards 
our products must comply with industry standards  fcc regulations  state  country specific and international regulations  and changes may require us to modify existing products 
in addition to reliability and quality standards  the market acceptance of telephony over broadband ip networks is dependent upon the adoption of industry standards so that products from multiple manufacturers are able to communicate with each other 
our voip telephony products rely heavily on standards such as sip  h  mgcp and megaco to interoperate with other vendors equipment 
there is currently a lack of agreement among industry leaders about which standard should be used for a particular application  and about the definition of the standards themselves 
these standards  as well as audio and video compression standards  continue to evolve 
we also must comply with certain rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc regarding electromagnetic radiation and safety standards established by underwriters laboratories  as well as similar regulations and standards applicable in other countries 
standards are continuously being modified and replaced 
as standards evolve  we may be required to modify our existing products or develop and support new versions of our products 
the failure of our products to comply  or delays in compliance  with various existing and evolving industry standards could delay or interrupt volume production of our voip telephony products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
future legislation or regulation of the internet and or voice and video over ip services could restrict our business  prevent us from offering service or increase our cost of doing business 
at present there are few laws  regulations or rulings that specifically address access to or commerce on the internet  including ip telephony 
we are unable to predict the impact  if any  that future legislation  legal decisions or regulations concerning the internet may have on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
regulation may be targeted towards  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  imposing taxes related to internet communications  imposing tariffs or regulations based on encryption concerns or the characteristics and quality of products and services  imposing regulations and requirements related to the handling of emergency services  any of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
the increasing growth of the broadband ip telephony market and popularity of broadband ip telephony products and services heighten the risk that governments or other legislative bodies will seek to regulate broadband ip telephony and the internet 
in addition  large  established telecommunication companies may devote substantial lobbying efforts to influence the regulation of the broadband ip telephony market  which may be contrary to our interests 
many regulatory actions are underway or are being contemplated by federal and state authorities  including the fcc and other state regulatory agencies 
on february   the fcc initiated a notice of public rule making to update fcc policy and consider the appropriate regulatory classification for voip and other ip enabled services 
on february   the california public utilities commission cpuc initiated an investigation into voice over ip providers 
as a tentative conclusion of law  the cpuc stated that they believe that voip providers are telecommunications providers and should be treated as such from a regulatory standpoint 
there is risk that a regulatory agency requires us to conform to rules that are unsuitable for ip communications technologies or rules that cannot be complied with due to the nature and efficiencies of ip routing  or are unnecessary or unreasonable in light of the manner in which packet offers service to its customers 
it is not possible to separate the internet  or any service offered over it  into intrastate and interstate components 
while suitable alternatives may be developed in the future  the current ip network does not enable us to identify the geographic nature of the traffic traversing the internet 
there is also risk that specific e requirements imposed by a regulatory agency may impede our ability to offer service in a manner that conforms to these requirements 
while we are developing technologies that seek to provide access to emergency services in conjunction with our ip communications offerings  the existing requirements  which are tethered to and dependent upon the legacy pstn network  neither work in an ip environment nor take advantage of the significantly enhanced capabilities of the ip network 
the effects of federal or state regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
increasing interest by us states in the regulation of voice over ip services could result in laws or regulatory actions that harm our business 
several states have recently shown an interest in regulating voice over ip  or voip  services  as they do for providers of traditional telephone service 
if this trend continues  and if state regulation is not preempted by action by the us federal government  we may become subject to a patchwork quilt of state regulations and taxes  which would increase our costs of doing business  and adversely affect our operating results and future prospects 
we have already been contacted by several state regulatory authorities regarding our packet service 
on september   we received a letter from the public service commission of wisconsin the wpsc notifying us that the wpsc believes that we  via our packet voice and video communications service  are offering intrastate telecommunications services in the state of wisconsin without certification of the wpsc 
according to the wpsc s letter  it believes that we cannot legally provide packet based resold intrastate services in wisconsin without certification of the wpsc 
in addition  the commission believes that packet bills for intrastate services to wisconsin customers are void and not collectible 
the letter also states that if we do not obtain certification to offer intrastate telecommunications services  the matter will be referred to the state of wisconsin attorney general for enforcement action 
the letter also states that even if the company were certified by the wpsc  the previous operation without certification may still subject the company to referral to the state of wisconsin attorney general for enforcement action and possible forfeitures 
we consulted with counsel and have responded to the wpsc and disputed their assertions 
while we do not believe that the potential amounts of any forfeitures would be material to us  if we are subject to an enforcement action  we may become subject to liabilities and may incur expenses that adversely affect our results of operations 
on september   we were contacted by the ohio public utilities commission opuc and asked to respond to a questionnaire on voice over ip technologies that the opuc is conducting 
the opuc inquired as to the nature of our service  how it is provided  and to what ohio residents the service is made available 
the questionnaire did not contain any assertions regarding the legality of the packet service under ohio law or any statements as to whether the opuc believes we are subject to regulation by the state of ohio 
we responded to this questionnaire on october  on september   we also received a letter from the california public utilities commission cpuc 
the correspondence alleges that we are offering intrastate telecommunications services for profit in california without having received formal certification from the cpuc to provide such service 
the cpuc also requested that we file an application with the cpuc for authority to conduct business as a telecommunications utility no later than october  we consulted with regulatory counsel and have responded to the cpuc and disputed their assertions and did not file the requested application 
in our response to the state of california  we disagreed with the cpuc s classification of us as a telephone corporation under the california public utilities code 
the letter from the cpuc did not indicate  and we cannot predict  what any potential penalties or consequences in failing to obtain certification might be 
if we are subjected to penalties  or if we are required to comply with cpuc regulations affecting telecommunications service providers  our business may be adversely affected 
on november   the cpuc held a hearing in san francisco to hear testimony from cpuc staff and industry representatives regarding what course of action the cpuc should take with respect to internet telephony 
a representative from x testified at the hearing 
in january  the cpuc issued a statement that stated that it was pulling back from its immediate enforcement approach against ip telephony service providers  and was establishing a more deliberative process to set regulations 
on february   the cpuc approved a formal investigation and rulemaking into voip providers 
the cpuc has indicated that this process could last up to months  but there is no way for us to predict the timetable or outcome of this process 
most recently  on may   in response to a complaint case brought by frontier telephone of rochester against vonage  the new york state public service commission  or nypsc concluded that vonage is a telephone corporation as defined by new york law and must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity  which represents the authorization of the psc to provide telephone service in new york 
the nypsc will allow a forty five day period in which vonage can identify and seek waivers of any rules that it believes should not apply 
vonage will be required to provide service in some form  and will be required to file a schedule of its rates 
currently  this decision applies only to vonage 
while this ruling applies only to vonage and not to us  if we are subject to regulation by the nypsc  we may become subject to liabilities and may incur expenses that adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be subject to liabilities for past sales and our future sales may decrease 
in accordance with current industry practice  we do not collect state and federal telecommunications taxes  other than federal excise tax  or other telecommunications surcharges with respect to our packet service 
we do not collect value added tax  or vat  for services that we provide to customers in european union  or eu  member countries 
future expansion of our packet service  along with other aspects of our evolving business  may result in additional sales and other tax obligations 
one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on out of jurisdiction companies that provide telephone service 
a successful assertion by one or more states or foreign countries that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of merchandise or services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  decrease our ability to compete with traditional telephone companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
potential regulation of internet service providers could adversely affect our operations 
to date  the fcc has treated internet service providers as information service providers 
information service providers are currently exempt from federal and state regulations governing common carriers  including the obligation to pay access charges and contribute to the universal service fund 
the fcc is currently examining the status of internet service providers and the services they provide 
if the fcc were to determine that internet service providers  or the services they provide  are subject to fcc regulation  including the payment of access charges and contribution to the universal service funds  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
there may be risks associated with the lack of emergency dialing with the packet service 
we market the packet service to our residential customers as a secondary line service  not a primary line service 
we do not encourage our residential customers to use packet as their only telephone service  due to the fact that the ip dialtone service is only as reliable as a customer s underlying data service which is not provided by us 
we play a recorded message to any of our customers who dial from phones connected to the packet service instructing them to hang up and either dial their local police fire department directly from the phone on the packet service  or to dial from a phone connected to the traditional telephone network 
however  there may be a risk of liability or future regulatory action with respect to the inability of customers to access local emergency services from a telephone connected to packet service 
to date  the fcc has not classified any interstate voip telephony service provider as a telecommunications carrier  preferring instead to permit the nascent industry to grow 
under current federal law  providers of information services do not incur obligations to participate in and e emergency calling systems 
however  there is no guarantee that the fcc s interpretations and the relevant federal law will not change in a manner that may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect our ability to deliver the packet service 
we are currently working on ways to deliver e services to our subscribers 
however  many of the technical issues related to the mobility of ip endpoints may hamper the effectiveness of such a solution 
also  the rollout of e services to our subscribers will occur over time  and we cannot guarantee that service will be available to all of our subscribers  or to subscribers outside of the united states 
we are also developing ways to directly connect ip calls to emergency services  but there is no guarantee that these new technologies will work or that regulatory authorities will find these new methods acceptable for the handling of emergency call traffic 
we may lose customers if we experience system failures that significantly disrupt the availability and quality of the services that we provide 
the operation of our packet service depends on our ability to avoid and mitigate any interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers 
interruptions in service or performance problems  for whatever reason  could undermine confidence in our services and cause us to lose customers or make it more difficult to attract new ones 
in addition  because our services may be critical to the businesses of our customers  any significant interruption in service could result in lost profits or other loss to our customers 
although we attempt to disclaim liability in our service agreements  a court might not enforce a limitation on liability  which could expose us to financial loss 
in addition  we may provide our customers with guaranteed service level commitments 
if we are unable to meet these guaranteed service level commitments as a result of service interruptions  we may be obligated to provide credits  generally in the form of free service for a short period of time  to our customers  which could negatively affect our operating results 
consumer access to our websites directly affects our ability to sign new subscribers and the account management services we offer and thus affects our service revenues 
we experience occasional system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to consumers  which may reduce our service revenues and the attractiveness of our products and services 
if we are unable to continually add additional software and hardware and upgrade our systems and network infrastructure in an effective manner  it could cause service interruption and adversely affect our ability to deliver the packet service 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our network  or those of our partners or customers  could result in the interruption of customer service until necessary repairs are made or replacement equipment is installed 
network failures  delays and errors could also result from natural disasters  terrorist acts  power losses  security breaches and computer viruses 
these failures  faults or errors could cause delays  service interruptions  expose us to customer liability or require expensive modifications that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our success depends on our ability to handle a large number of simultaneous calls  which our network may not be able to accommodate 
we expect the volume of simultaneous calls to increase significantly as the packet subscriber base grows 
our network hardware and software may not be able to accommodate this additional volume 
if we fail to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance  or if our service is disrupted  our reputation could be hurt  we could lose customers and this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could be liable for breaches of security on our web site  fraudulent activities of our users  or the failure of third party vendors to deliver credit card transaction processing services 
a fundamental requirement for operating an internet based  worldwide voice and video communications service and electronically billing our packet customers is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches  failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results 
the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled 
we rely on third party providers to process and guarantee payments made by packet subscribers up to certain limits  and we may be unable to prevent our users from fraudulently receiving goods and services 
our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of our packet transactions involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions 
any costs we incur as a result of fraudulent transactions could harm our business 
in addition  the functionality of our current billing system relies on certain third party vendors delivering services 
if these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services  we will not be able to charge for our packet services in a timely or scalable fashion 
we have experienced losses due to subscriber fraud and theft of service 
subscribers have obtained access to the packet service without paying for monthly service and international toll calls by unlawfully using our authorization codes and submitting fraudulent credit card information 
to date  such losses from unauthorized credit card transactions and theft of service have not been significant 
we have implemented anti fraud procedures in order to control losses relating to these practices  but these procedures may not be adequate to effectively limit all of our exposure in the future from fraud 
if our procedures are not effective  consumer fraud and theft of service could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property and proprietary rights of others could prevent us from using necessary technology to provide ip voice and video services 
while we do not know of any technologies that are patented by others that we believe are necessary for us to provide our services  certain necessary technology may in fact be patented by other parties either now or in the future 
if such technology were held under patent by another person  we would have to negotiate a license for the use of that certain technology 
we may not be able to negotiate such a license at a price that is acceptable 
the existence of such a patent  or our inability to negotiate a license for any such technology on acceptable terms  could force us to cease using such technology and offering products and services incorporating such technology 
if we discover product defects  we may have product related liabilities which may cause us to lose revenues or delay market acceptance of our products 
products as complex as those we offer frequently contain errors  defects  and functional limitations when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have in the past experienced such errors  defects or functional limitations 
we sell products into markets that are extremely demanding of robust  reliable  fully functional products 
therefore  delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of such products  which could damage our credibility with our customers and adversely affect our ability to retain our existing customers and to attract new customers 
moreover  such errors  defects or functional limitations could cause problems  interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
alleviating such problems may require significant expenditures of capital and resources by us 
despite our testing  our suppliers or our customers may find errors  defects or functional limitations in new products after commencement of commercial production 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  product repair or replacement costs  claims by our customers or others against us  or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we have significant international operations  which subject us to risks that could cause our operating results to decline 
sales to customers outside of the united states during the years ended march   and were   and  respectively  of total revenues 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands year ended march  united states    europe    taiwan    japan  other   substantially all of our products are  and substantially all of our future products will be  manufactured  assembled  and tested by independent third parties in foreign countries 
international sales and manufacturing are subject to a number of risks  including general economic conditions in regions such as asia  changes in foreign government regulations and telecommunication standards  export license requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  potentially adverse tax consequences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  the impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  and difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations 
we are also subject to geopolitical risks  such as political  social  and economic instability  potential hostilities  and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  in connection with our international operations 
taiwan in particular is subject to a high rate of natural disasters  such as earthquakes or typhoons  which could have significant impact on our suppliers and customers due to a delay in operations within that country 
in addition  taiwan s tenuous relationship with mainland china is a source of continuing concern due to potential hostilities 
a significant decline in demand from foreign markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may need to raise additional capital to support our operations 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of approximately million 
unless we achieve and maintain profitability  we will need to raise additional capital in fiscal we may not be able to obtain such additional financing as needed on acceptable terms  or at all  which may require us to reduce our operating costs and other expenditures  including reductions of personnel and capital expenditures 
if we issue additional equity or convertible debt securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced and they may experience significant dilution 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we are not successful in these actions  we may be forced to cease operations 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq smallcap market  which has certain compliance requirements for continued listing of common stock 
if our minimum closing bid price per share falls below for a period of consecutive business days in the future  we may again be subject to delisting procedures 
as of the close of business on may   our common stock had a closing bid price of per share 
we must also meet additional continued listing requirements contained in nasdaq marketplace rule c b  which requires that we have a minimum of  in stockholders equity or  market value of listed securities or  of net income from continuing operations for the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years 
as of may   based on our closing price as of that day  the market value of our securities approximated million and we were in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c b 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the continued listing requirements 
delisting could reduce the ability of our shareholders to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically 
for instance  failure to obtain listing on another market or exchange may make it more difficult for traders to sell our securities 
broker dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our common stock 
not maintaining a listing on a major stock market may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock  lessen interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our common stock  make it more difficult to obtain analyst coverage  and make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of risks associated with international operations and related foreign currencies 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in europe and asia 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  the vast majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  almost all of our arrangements with our semiconductor and system vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have foreign subsidiaries and are exposed to market risk from changes in exchange rates 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
to date  our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant  however  there can be no assurance that there will not be a material impact in the future 
we invest the majority of our surplus cash and cash equivalents in money market funds that bear variable interest rates  and  accordingly  fluctuations in interest rates do not have an impact on the fair values of such investments
