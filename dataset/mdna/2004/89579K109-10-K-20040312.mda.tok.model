hospital management services qhr is a leading provider of management and consulting services to acute care hospitals  providing management services to approximately hospitals as of december  qhr provides management services to independent hospitals and hospital systems under management contracts and also provides selected consulting  educational and related services 
qhr assists hospitals in improving their financial performance and the scope of their services 
most of the hospitals for which qhr performs management  consulting or support services are independent not for profit hospitals 
these hospitals are generally located in non urban areas 
approximately of these hospitals have less than beds 
upon entering into a management contract  qhr first assesses the operations of the hospital  including the hospital s financial management  the economic and population related factors affecting the hospital s market  physician relationships and staffing requirements 
then  based on its assessment  qhr develops and recommends a management plan to the hospital s governing board 
to implement the management plan adopted for each hospital  qhr typically provides the hospital with personnel to serve as the hospital s chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
although these people are qhr employees  they operate under the direction and control of the hospital s governing body  and the balance of the hospital staff remain employees of the hospital under the control and supervision of the hospital 
qhr s hospital based team is supported by its regional and corporate management staff 
qhr currently has regional offices located throughout the united states 
qhr s regional office staff is experienced in providing management services to hospitals of all sizes in diverse markets throughout the united states 
each regional office is responsible for the management services provided within its geographic area 
qhr s hospital management contracts generally have a term of three to five years and typically have a renewal rate of approximately 
qhr s management contract fees are based on amounts agreed upon by qhr and the hospital s governing body  and generally are not related to the hospital s revenues or other variables 
under qhr s hospital management contracts  qhr is not responsible for hospital licensure  certificates of need  liability coverage  capital expenditures or other functions which are normally the responsibility of a hospital s governing body 
qhr offers consulting and related educational and management services to hospitals that are not part of its contract management program 
qhr s consulting services are directed at many of the operational needs of hospitals  including accounts receivable management  health information management  human resources  facility design and various operational services 
qhr also provides consulting services to large  sophisticated medical institutions that need hospital management advice for specific issues 
competition the hospital industry is highly competitive 
triad competes with other hospitals and health care providers for patients 
the competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
in some cases  competing hospitals are more established than triad s hospitals 
certain of these competing facilities  particularly in urban markets  offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by triad s facilities 
in addition  in certain of the markets where triad operates  there are large teaching hospitals which provide highly specialized facilities  equipment and services which may not be available at triad s hospitals 
although some of triad s hospitals are located in geographic areas where they are currently the sole provider of general  acute care hospital services in their communities  these hospitals also face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
despite the fact that these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care incentives or personal choice 

index to financial statements in addition  some of the hospitals that compete with triad are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions 
these hospitals can make capital expenditures without paying sales taxes  and are generally exempt from property and income taxes 
triad also faces competition from other specialized care providers  including specialty hospitals  outpatient surgery  orthopedic  oncology and diagnostic centers 
state certificate of need laws con laws  which place limitations on a hospital s ability to expand hospital services and add new equipment  also may have the effect of restricting competition 
seven states in which triad operates  alabama  alaska  mississippi  ohio  oregon  south carolina and west virginia  have con laws 
the application process for approval of covered services  facilities  changes in operations and capital expenditures including certain acquisitions of facilities in these states is  therefore  highly competitive 
in those states which have no con laws or which set relatively high thresholds before expenditures become reviewable by state authorities  competition in the form of new services  facilities and capital spending is more prevalent 
the number and quality of the physicians on a hospital s staff are important factors in a hospital s competitive advantage 
physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed 
triad believes that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the quality of services it renders to patients and physicians  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital s facilities  equipment and employees 
admitting physicians may be on the medical staff of other hospitals in addition to those of triad s hospitals 
one element of triad s business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals in select markets 
the competition to acquire hospitals is significant 
triad may acquire or develop on a selective basis  hospitals that are similar to those currently owned and operated 
however  suitable acquisitions may not be accomplished due to unfavorable terms 
triad may also seek to expand through the formation of joint ventures with other providers  including not for profit health care providers 
another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital is management s ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group health care services  such as managed care plans  which attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
employers and traditional health insurers are also interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price  market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of the medical staff and convenience 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations 
qhr also faces competitive challenges in the area of management services 
in seeking management services  hospitals have a variety of alternatives 
hospitals managed by hospital management companies represent less than of the total acute care hospitals in the united states 
most hospitals have their own management staff 
some hospitals choose to obtain management services from large  tertiary care facilities that create referral networks with smaller surrounding hospitals 
triad  and the health care industry as a whole  face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs  strong competition for patients and pressures by both private and government payers to control reimbursement rates 
as both private and government payers reduce the scope of what may be reimbursed and control reimbursement levels for what is covered  federal and state efforts to reform the health care system may further impact reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payers may require changes in triad s facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 
the hospital industry and triad s hospitals continue to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average occupancy rates have historically been negatively affected by payer required pre admission authorization  utilization review  patient preference and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients 
admissions constraints  payer pressures and 
index to financial statements increased competition are expected to continue 
triad endeavors to meet these challenges by expanding many of its facilities to include outpatient centers  offering discounts to private payer groups  upgrading facilities and equipment and offering new programs and services 
employees and medical staff at december   triad had approximately  employees  including approximately  part time employees  as well as approximately employees providing hospital management and consulting services 
employees at four hospitals are currently represented by labor unions 
triad considers its employee relations to be good 
while triad s non union hospitals experience union organizational activity from time to time  triad does not expect such efforts to materially affect its future operations 
triad s hospitals  like most hospitals  have experienced labor costs rising faster than the general inflation rate  primarily in nursing 
there can be no assurance as to future availability and cost of qualified medical personnel 
triad s hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals 
physicians generally are not employees of triad s hospitals although there are varying levels of employed physicians in certain markets 
some physicians provide services in triad s hospitals under contracts  which generally describe a term of service  provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians  require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services 
any licensed physician may apply to be admitted to the medical staff of any of triad s hospitals  but admission to the staff must be approved by the hospital s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital in accordance with established credentialing criteria 
members of the medical staffs of triad s hospitals located in areas where there are other hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with a hospital at any time 
triad periodically performs both employee and physician satisfaction surveys 
the surveys are used by management to enhance operating performance of each hospital 
triad s ethics and compliance program it is triad s policy that its business be conducted with integrity and in compliance with applicable law 
triad has developed a corporate wide ethics and compliance program  which focuses on all areas of policy and regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices and laboratory operations 
this ethics and compliance program is intended to assure that high standards of conduct are maintained in the operation of triad s business and to help assure that policies and procedures are implemented so that employees act in full compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and company policies 
under the ethics and compliance program  triad provides initial and periodic legal compliance and ethics training to every employee  reviews various areas of triad s operations  and develops and implements policies and procedures designed to foster compliance with the law 
triad regularly monitors its ongoing compliance efforts 
the program also includes a mechanism for employees to report  without fear of retaliation  any suspected legal or ethical violations to their supervisors or designated compliance officers in triad s hospitals  as well as a national hotline to which employees can report  on an anonymous basis if preferred  any suspected violations 
triad has also established a separate committee of the board of directors to monitor the compliance program 
on november   triad entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general the oig and agreed to maintain its compliance program in accordance with the corporate integrity agreement 
this obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities 
violations of the integrity agreement could subject triad s hospitals to substantial monetary penalties 
the cost to implement and maintain the compliance program was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
continuing compliance with the corporate integrity agreement may impose expensive and burdensome requirements on certain operations which could have a material adverse impact on triad 
the compliance measures and reporting and auditing requirements for triad s hospitals contained in the integrity agreement include continuing the duties and activities of corporate compliance officers and committees and maintaining a written code of conduct and written policies and procedures  
index to financial statements providing general training on the compliance policy and the agreement and specific training for the appropriate personnel on billing  coding and cost report issues  having an independent third party conduct periodic audits of inpatient hospital service coding and laboratory billing  continuing a confidential disclosure program and compliance hotline and implementing enhanced screening to ensure ineligible employees and contractors are not hired  reporting material deficiencies resulting in an overpayment by a federal healthcare program and probable violations of certain laws  rules and regulations  and submitting annual reports to the oig describing the operations of the corporate compliance program for the past year 
reimbursement medicare 
under the medicare program  acute care hospitals generally receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system pps for inpatient hospital services 
psychiatric  specially designated children s hospitals and certain designated cancer research hospitals  as well as psychiatric units that are distinct parts of a hospital and meet the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms criteria for exemption  are currently exempt from pps and are reimbursed on a cost based system  subject to certain cost limits known as tefra limits 
under pps  fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient s assigned diagnosis related group drg 
drgs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis 
drg rates have been established for each hospital participating in the medicare program  are based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity and are adjusted for area wage differentials but do not consider a specific hospital s costs 
drg rates are updated and re calibrated annually and have been affected by several recent federal enactments 
the index used to adjust the drg rates  known as the market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside of the health care industry in purchasing goods and services 
although for several years the percentage increases to the drg rates have been lower than the percentage increases in the costs of goods and services purchased by hospitals  the benefits improvement protection act of bipa updated the rates hospitals receive so that hospitals generally received the market basket index minus for discharges occurring on or after october  and before march  or the market basket index plus for discharges occurring on or after april  and before october  for federal fiscal year  hospitals generally received the market basket index minus 
for federal fiscal year  hospitals generally will receive the full market basket 
future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for drg payments  which could make it more difficult to grow revenue and to maintain or improve operating margins 
until august   outpatient services provided at general  acute care hospitals typically were reimbursed based on costs  subject to certain adjustments and limits 
the balanced budget act of bba contains provisions that affect outpatient hospital services  including a requirement that cms adopt a pps system for outpatient hospital services apcs  which became effective august  based on provisions of bipa  apcs were updated by the market basket minus and in federal fiscal years and  respectively  and were updated by the market basket for federal fiscal year for calendar year  apcs will be updated by the full market basket index 
similarly  effective january   therapy services rendered by hospitals to outpatients and inpatients not reimbursed under medicare are reimbursed according to the medicare physician fee schedule 
payments for medicare skilled nursing facility services and home health services historically have been paid based on costs  subject to certain adjustments and limits 
although bba mandates a pps system for skilled nursing facility services  home health services and inpatient rehabilitation hospital services  bipa has made adjustments to the pps payments for these health care service providers 
specifically  for skilled nursing facilities  bba set the annual inflation update at the market basket index minus in and however  bipa adjusted the update to the full market basket index in and the market basket index minus in the update for was the market basket minus 
for federal fiscal year  the rates will be updated by the market 
index to financial statements basket 
in addition to the creation of a pps system for skilled nursing  the bba also institutes consolidated billing for skilled nursing facility services  under which payments for most non physician services for beneficiaries no longer eligible for skilled nursing facility care will be made to the facility  regardless of whether the item or service was furnished by the facility  by others under arrangement  or under any other contracting or consulting arrangement 
consolidated billing is being implemented on a transition basis 
as of december   of triad s hospitals operated skilled nursing facilities 
in addition to establishing a pps system for home health services  bba requires a payment reduction in payment limits to home health agencies 
however  bipa delayed the implementation of this reduction until in fiscal year  the payment reduction was reduced by approximately and the rural add on payment expired on march  for through the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma provides for a reduction in the annual payment update and added a rural add on for discharges between april  through march  as of december   less than of triad s revenues were derived from home health services 
payments to pps exempt hospitals and units such as inpatient psychiatric hospital services are based upon reasonable costs  subject to a cost per discharge target 
these limits are updated annually by a market basket index 
bipa made several changes in payments to pps exempt hospitals 
in  payments for rehabilitation hospitals were made under a pps system 
as a result of changes outlined in bipa  total payments for rehabilitation hospitals in are to equal the amounts of payments that would have been made if the rehabilitation pps system had not been enacted  and rehabilitation facilities are able to make a one time election before the start of the pps to be paid based on a fully phased in pps rate 
in addition  bipa increases the incentive payments paid for inpatient psychiatric services from to  raises the national cap on long term care hospital reimbursement by and increases the individual long term care hospital target amounts by 
on november   proposed rules were issued to convert reimbursement for pps exempt psychiatric hospitals and units to a prospective payment system 
under the proposed rules  reimbursement will be based on a prospectively determined per diem for cost reporting periods beginning on or after april  also  the proposed rule includes a three year transition period 
currently  physicians are paid by medicare according to the physician fee schedule 
however  physicians working in rural health clinics  such as those maintained by triad  are reimbursed for their professional and administrative services through the rural health clinic subject to per visit limits unless the rural health clinic is based at a rural hospital with less than beds 
there are rural health clinics affiliated with triad s hospitals 
medicare has special payment provisions for sole community hospitals 
a sole community hospital is generally the only hospital in at least a mile radius 
eight of triad s facilities qualify as sole community hospitals under medicare regulations 
special payment provisions related to sole community hospitals may include a higher reimbursement rate  which is based on a blend of hospital specific costs and a national reimbursement rate  and a payment floor for capital costs which guarantees the sole community hospital capital reimbursement equal to of capital cost 
in addition  the tricare program that provides medical insurance benefits to government employees has special payment provisions for hospitals recognized as sole community hospitals for medicare purposes 
medicare provides  in the form of outlier payments  for additional payment  beyond standard drg payments  for covered hospital services furnished to a medicare beneficiary if the operating costs of furnishing those services exceed a certain threshold 
during  cms initiated an outlier reimbursement review process to assess nationally whether or not the amount of outlier payments being made to selected hospitals was appropriate 
cms issued proposed regulations in march that became effective october  that modified certain elements of the outlier reimbursement calculation 
triad derives less than of patient revenues from outlier payments and the modifications did not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
mma was signed into law on december  in addition to creating a new medicare prescription drug benefit  mma provides for a number of other significant changes in the medicare program 
these changes include a reduction in the annual update for ambulatory surgery center payments from april through the third quarter of and no payment update for the fourth quarter of through mma also provides for reductions in the 
index to financial statements annual update in home health agency payments for through  and for a reduction in the annual update for inpatient hospital payments from through for hospitals that do not submit to the medicare program quality reporting data specified under the national voluntary hospital reporting initiative 
mma also includes a number of provisions designed to increase medicare payments to small urban and rural hospitals  increasing the limit on disproportionate share payments that rural hospitals may receive  and permitting an adjustment to the calculation of the standardized payment to benefit hospitals in low wage areas  such as rural hospitals and equalizes the drg base payment rate among hospitals 
triad is unable to predict the ultimate impact of mma  but no assurance can be given that it will not have an adverse effect on triad s business 
however  on a preliminary basis  triad anticipates that it may receive an additional million in reimbursement from mma in medicaid 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps  or under programs which negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital s cost of services 
medicaid is currently funded jointly by the state and the federal governments 
the federal government and many states are currently considering significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding while at the same time expanding medicaid benefits  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
annual cost reports 
all hospitals participating in the medicare program  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under pps  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries 
if triad or any triad facility is found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  triad could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on triad s financial position and results of operations 
hca has agreed to indemnify triad in respect of losses arising from such government investigations for the periods prior to the spin off 
see governmental investigations governmental investigation of hca and related litigation for more information regarding such arrangement 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to triad under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts earned under the programs 
providers also have rights of appeal  and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years reports 
the due dates for cost reports for cost reporting periods ending after august  were delayed due to cms not issuing the final payment schedules for apcs 
beginning in october  the final payment schedules for apcs began to be issued for cost reporting periods ended after august  triad has filed cost reports for these periods 
the delay in filing these cost reports will extend the time period of final determination of amounts earned 
pursuant to the terms of the spin off distribution agreement  hca agreed to indemnify triad for any payments which it is required to make with respect to the medicare  medicaid and blue cross cost reports for triad facilities operated by hca prior to the spin off relating to periods ending on or prior to the spin off and triad agreed to indemnify hca for and pay to hca any payments received by triad relating to such cost reports 
triad was responsible for the medicare  medicaid and blue cross cost reports  and associated receivables and payables  for triad s facilities for all periods prior to the spin off 
in july  hca finalized a settlement agreement with the government relating to cost report periods ending before august  which includes the indemnified cost reports 
managed care 
pressures to control the cost of health care have historically resulted in increases in volumes attributable to managed care payers compared to traditional commercial indemnity insurers 
triad generally receives lower payments from managed care payers than from traditional commercial indemnity insurers  however  as part of its business strategy  triad has taken steps to improve its managed care position 
see business strategy for a more detailed discussion of such strategy 
commercial insurance 
triad hospitals provide services to some individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers make direct payments to such hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 

index to financial statements commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including prospective payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of the hospitals of triad 
government regulation and other factors licensure  certification and accreditation 
health care facilities are subject to federal  state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  fire prevention  rate setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation 
all of triad s health care facilities are properly licensed under appropriate state laws 
all of the hospitals affiliated with triad are certified under the medicare and medicaid programs and all are accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  the effect of which is to permit the facilities to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs 
should any facility lose its accreditation by this joint commission  or otherwise lose its certification under the medicare and or medicaid program  the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the facilities of triad are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal  state  local and independent review body regulations and standards 
the requirements for licensure  certification and accreditation are subject to change and  in order to remain qualified  it may be necessary for triad to effect changes in its facilities  equipment  personnel and services 
certificates of need 
the construction of new facilities  the acquisition of existing facilities  and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by state regulatory agencies under a con program 
triad operates in seven states alabama  alaska  mississippi  ohio  oregon  south carolina  and west virginia that require con approval to expand certain acute care hospital services 
such laws generally require state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the addition of beds or services or certain other capital expenditures 
failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the inability to expand facilities  add services  complete an acquisition or change ownership 
further  violation of such laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of a facility s license 
state rate review 
the state of arizona adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals 
in the aggregate  state rate or budget review and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely affected the results of operations of triad 
triad is not able to predict whether any additional state rate or budget review or indigent tax provisions will be adopted and  accordingly  is not able to assess the effect thereof on its results of operations or financial condition 
utilization review 
federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to medicare and medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards  are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed 
these provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of medicare and medicaid patients must be reviewed by peer review organizations  which review the appropriateness of medicare and medicaid patient admissions and discharges  the quality of care provided  the validity of drg classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost 
peer review organizations may deny payment for services provided  may assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the department of health and human services hhs that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the peer review organization be excluded from participation in the medicare program 
utilization review is also a requirement of most non governmental managed care organizations 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws 
a trend affecting the health care industry today is the increased use of the federal false claims act  and  in particular  actions being brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 

index to financial statements when a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the false claims act  the defendant must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  to  for each separate false claim 
settlements entered into prior to litigation usually involve a less severe damages methodology 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
in addition  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court 
from time to time  companies in the health care industry  including triad  may be subject to actions under the false claims act 
for a more complete discussion of litigation brought against triad under the false claims act  see governmental investigations 
federal and state fraud and abuse 
participation in the medicare program is heavily regulated by federal statute and regulation 
if a hospital fails substantially to comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the medicare program or performs certain prohibited acts  such hospital s participation in the medicare program may be terminated or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed upon it under certain provisions of the social security act 
for example  the social security act prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration intended to induce referrals of patients to receive goods or services covered by a federal health care program the anti kickback statute 
in addition to felony criminal penalties fines up to  and imprisonment  the social security act establishes civil monetary penalties and the sanction of excluding violators from participation in the federal health care programs 
the anti kickback statute has been interpreted broadly by federal regulators and certain courts to prohibit the intentional payment of anything of value if even one purpose of the payment is to influence the referral of medicare or medicaid business 
therefore  many commonplace commercial arrangements between hospitals and physicians could be considered by the government to violate the anti kickback statute 
as authorized by congress  the oig has published final safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
currently  there are safe harbors for various activities  including  but not limited to investment interest  space rental  equipment rental  practitioner recruitment  personal services and management contracts  sale of practice  discounts  employees  investments in group practices  and ambulatory surgery centers 
the fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement unlawful under the anti kickback statute 
the conduct and business arrangements  however  do risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities 
triad has a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to triad s hospitals 
triad also has contracts with physicians providing for a variety of financial arrangements  including employment contracts  leases  and professional service agreements 
triad also provides financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by triad s hospitals 
several of triad s freestanding surgery centers have physician investors and physicians own interests in certain of triad s hospitals 
some of the arrangements with physicians do not expressly meet requirements for safe harbor protection 
it cannot be assured that regulatory authorities that enforce the anti kickback statute will not determine that any of these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute or other federal or state laws 
the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to medicare and medicaid 
false claims include  but are not limited to  billing for services not rendered  billing for services without prescribed documentation  misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud 
like the anti kickback statute  these provisions are very broad 
further  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa created civil penalties for conduct including improper coding and billing for unnecessary goods and services 
hipaa also broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
the social security act also includes a provision commonly known as the stark law 
this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship if these entities provide certain designated health services that are 
index to financial statements reimbursable by medicare  including inpatient and outpatient hospital services 
sanctions for violating the stark law include civil penalties up to  per prohibited service provided  assessments equal to twice the dollar value of each such service provided and exclusion from the federal health care programs 
there are a number of exceptions to the self referral prohibition  including an exception for a physician s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department 
there are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers  including employment contracts  leases and recruitment agreements 
on january   cms issued final regulations subject to comment intended to clarify parts of the stark law and some of the exceptions to it 
these regulations are considered phase i  of a two phase process  with the remaining regulations to be published at an unknown future date 
phase i of the regulations became effective january   except in the case of the provisions relating to home health agencies  which became effective april  many of the states in which triad operates also have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti kickback statute and the stark law  some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care 
these statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure 
little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws 
corporate practice of medicine 
some of the states in which triad operates have laws that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between health care providers 
in addition  some states restrict certain business relationships between physicians and pharmacies 
possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of a physician s license and civil and criminal penalties 
these statutes vary from state to state  are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
although triad exercises care to structure its arrangements with health care providers to comply with the relevant state law  and believes such arrangements comply with applicable laws in all material respects  there can be no assurance that governmental officials charged with responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that triad  or certain transactions in which it is involved  is in violation of such laws  or that such laws ultimately will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with the interpretations of triad 
health care reform 
health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
proposals that have been considered include cost controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  patients bills of rights and requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees 
the costs of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reductions in payments by governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers such as hospitals 
there can be no assurance that future health care legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs will not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of triad 
administrative simplification 
the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
on august   cms published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all health care providers must use when submitting or receiving certain health care transactions electronically 
as of october   the date set for compliance  triad is in compliance with these regulations 
in december  cms  acting under hipaa  released final regulations which required compliance by april relating to the adoption of standards to protect the privacy of health related information 
these privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information 
cms has also promulgated final regulations under hipaa establishing standards to protect the security of health related information 
these regulations were published in february and require compliance by april they require health care providers to implement organizational and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
the privacy regulations and the security 
index to financial statements regulations  when they become effective  could impose significant costs on triad s facilities in order to comply with these standards 
violations of the regulations could result in civil penalties of up to  per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to  per violation 
in addition  triad s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under hipaa  which vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
conversion legislation 
many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise authority over these transactions based upon existing law 
in many states there has been an increased interest in the oversight of not for profit conversions 
the adoption of conversion legislation and the increased review of not for profit hospital conversions may increase the cost and difficulty or prevent the completion of transactions with not for profit organizations in certain states in the future 
revenue ruling during march  the irs issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of certain joint ventures between for profit and not for profit hospitals 
triad has not determined the impact of the tax ruling on the development of future ventures 
the tax ruling could limit joint venture development with not for profit hospitals 
environmental matters 
triad is subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
triad does not expect that it will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect its capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
insurance 
as is typical in the health care industry  triad is subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business 
to cover these claims  triad maintains professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts which it believes to be sufficient for its operations  although it is possible that some claims may exceed the scope of the coverage in effect 
the cost of malpractice and other liability insurance rose significantly in and there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available at reasonable prices which will allow triad to maintain adequate levels of coverage 
substantially all losses in periods prior to the spin off are insured through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary of hca and excess loss policies maintained by hca 
hca has agreed to indemnify triad in respect of claims covered by such insurance policies arising prior to the spin off 
after the spin off  triad elected to obtain insurance coverage on a claims incurred basis from hca s wholly owned insurance subsidiary with excess coverage obtained from other carriers which is subject to certain deductibles which triad considers to be reasonable 
for the facilities acquired in the quorum transaction  triad obtained tail coverage  subject to certain deductibles  to cover claims incurred prior to july  these facilities were converted to triad s existing coverage on august  triad has recorded an estimated liability for deductibles related to general and professional liability risks of million at december  any losses incurred in excess of amounts maintained under insurance policies will be funded from working capital 
there can be no assurance that the cash flow of triad will be adequate to provide for professional and general liability claims in the future 
see note accounting policies general and professional liability risks in the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of such arrangements 
governmental investigations false claims act litigation 
as a result of its ongoing discussions with the government prior to the merger of quorum with and into triad on april   quorum learned of two qui tam complaints against it alleging violations of the false claims act for claims allegedly submitted to the government involving one owned and two managed hospitals 
quorum accrued the estimated liability on these items prior to the merger 
the matter involving the two managed hospitals remains under seal and the matter involving the owned hospital has been settled 
with respect to the matter involving the two managed hospitals  the government has requested that quorum conduct a self 
index to financial statements audit with respect to one medicare cost report for one managed hospital and three other specific issues 
the government has stated that it intends to investigate certain other allegations 
on september   triad was served with a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement and improper allocation of costs at a hospital in mississippi managed by qhr  which is named as an additional defendant 
the federal government has elected not to intervene in the case and the complaint was recently unsealed 
while triad intends to vigorously defend this matter  triad is not yet able to form a view as to any probable liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint 
at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing investigations or qui tam action 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then triad may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
triad could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  triad may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect triad 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
from time to time  triad may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation which alleges violations of law 
triad may not know about such investigations or about qui tam actions filed against triad unless and to the extent such are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against triad  there could be a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial position  results of operations or prospects 
governmental investigation of hca and related litigation 
hca was the subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating to the business practices of hca and its subsidiaries  including subsidiaries that  prior to the spin off from hca  owned facilities now owned by triad 
these investigations were concluded through a series of agreements executed in and hca remains a defendant in qui tam actions on behalf of the united states alleging  in general  submission of improper claims to the government for reimbursement 
the lawsuits seek three times the amount of damages caused to the united states by the submission of any medicare or medicaid false claims presented by the defendants to the federal government  civil damages of not less than  nor more than  for each such medicare or medicaid claim  attorneys fees and costs 
hca has disclosed that of the original qui tam actions  the us department of justice intervened in eight actions that were settled in june the settlement agreement does not affect qui tam cases in which the government has not intervened 
hca also has previously disclosed that it is aware of additional qui tam actions that remain under seal and believes that there may be other sealed qui tam cases of which it is unaware 
hca is also the subject of a formal order of investigation by the sec 
hca understands that the sec s investigation includes the anti fraud  insider trading  periodic reporting and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws 
triad is unable to predict the effect or outcome of the ongoing sec investigation or qui tam actions  or whether any additional investigations or litigation will be commenced 
in connection with the spin off from hca  triad entered into a distribution agreement with hca 
the terms of the distribution agreement provide that hca will indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed to indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of proceedings which may be commenced by government authorities or by private parties in the future that arise from acts  practices or omissions engaged in prior to the date of the spin off and that relate to the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed that  in the event that any hospital owned by triad at the time of the spin off is permanently excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of the proceedings described above  then hca will make a cash payment to triad  in an amount if positive equal to five times the excluded hospital s income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  management fees  impairment of long lived assets  minority interests and income taxes  as set forth on a schedule to the distribution agreement  less the net proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the excluded hospital 

index to financial statements hca will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for losses relating to any acts  practices and omissions engaged in by triad after the spin off date  whether or not triad is indemnified for similar acts  practices and omissions occurring prior to the spin off 
hca also will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for similar qui tam litigation  governmental investigations and other actions to which quorum was subject  some of which are described above 
if indemnified matters were asserted successfully against triad or any of its facilities  and hca failed to meet its indemnification obligations  then this event could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
the extent to which triad may or may not continue to be affected by the investigations of hca and the initiation of additional investigations  if any  cannot be predicted 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during the fourth quarter of  triad acquired seven new hospitals  either by acquiring all of the assets of the hospital  leasing the existing facility or entering into joint ventures with not for profit hospital partners 
during  triad opened one new hospital and acquired all of the assets comprising  and a interest in the operations of  one hospital 
during  triad recorded a million increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect growth in uninsured receivables and deterioration in the collectibility of those receivables 
triad estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts using historical net write offs of uncollectible accounts 
during the third and fourth quarters of  triad experienced a significant increase in the amount of historical write offs 
the increase in historical write offs led triad to believe that the collectibility of its uninsured receivables had deteriorated 
during  uninsured receivables increased approximately million  from to of total billed hospital receivables or of total receivables 
triad believes that a weak job market and rising health care costs have led to the growth in uninsured patients and an increase in insurance co payments and deductibles  for which patients are directly responsible 
triad believes the increase in its allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable given current business trends and economic conditions 
triad currently anticipates that its provision for doubtful accounts will be approximately of revenues on an annual basis  although it could vary quarter to quarter 
if the trend of increasing uninsured receivables and deterioration in collectibility continues  then triad s results of operations and financial position could be further and materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  triad disposed of its interest in one entity and determined that two hospitals would be designated as held for sale 
these entities were reclassified as discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of triad s results of operations and statistics for prior periods have been restated to reflect this reclassification 
on april   triad completed the merger of quorum with and into triad with triad being the surviving corporation 
the purchase price was approximately billion 
the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations for quorum are included in triad s results of operations beginning may  on may   triad sold two of the acute care hospitals acquired in the merger with quorum for million plus million for working capital 
additionally  one hospital acquired in the merger with quorum was designated as held for sale prior to the completion of the merger 
the purchase price allocation of this hospital was equal to the sales price of the hospital plus the cash flows for its holding period and the interest expense on the incremental debt incurred for the purchase of the hospital 
on august   triad sold this hospital 
the results of operations of this entity are not included in triad s results of operations 
in  subsequent to the merger  triad recorded charges of approximately million associated with coordinating quorum s accounting policies  practices and estimation processes with those of triad 
the estimation processes used prior to and subsequent to the merger were consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these charges included an million pre tax reduction to revenue  million pre tax increase in provision for doubtful accounts and million additional income tax provision 

index to financial statements the above described events significantly affect the comparability of the results of operations for the years ended december   and forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains disclosures which are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts  and can be identified by the use of words such as may  believe  will  expect  project  estimate  anticipate  plan or continue 
these forward looking statements are based on the current plans and expectations of triad and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could significantly affect current plans and expectations and the future financial condition and results of triad 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the highly competitive nature of the health care business  the efforts of insurers and other payers  health care providers and others to contain health care costs  possible changes in medicare  medicaid and other government programs that may limit reimbursements to health care providers and insurers  changes in federal  state or local regulation affecting the health care industry  the possible enactment of federal or state health care reform  the ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel  including physicians and nurses  the departure of key executive officers from triad  claims and legal actions relating to professional liabilities and other matters  fluctuations in the market value of triad common stock  changes in accounting standards  changes in general economic conditions or geo political events  future acquisitions  joint venture development or divestitures which may result in additional charges  the ability to enter into managed care provider arrangements on acceptable terms  the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of triad s business  changes in business strategy or development plans  the ability to obtain adequate levels of general and professional liability insurance  potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations  timeliness of reimbursement payments received under government programs  and other risk factors 
as a consequence  current plans  anticipated actions and future financial condition and results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of triad 
you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates triad s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon triad s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires triad to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  triad evaluates its estimates  including those related to third party payer discounts  bad debts  property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  general and professional liability risks and contingencies and litigation 
triad bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
triad believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

index to financial statements revenue recognition triad s health care facilities have entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which the facilities are paid based upon several methodologies including established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payers and others for health care services provided 
triad has multiple patient accounting systems and  therefore  estimates for contractual allowances are calculated both systemically and manually  depending on the type of payer involved and the patient accounting system used by each hospital 
in certain systems  the contractual payment terms are preloaded into the system and the system calculates the amounts that are realizable 
in other systems  the contractual adjustments are determined manually using historical collections on each type of payer 
even for systems that record the realizable values  there are still manual estimates based upon historical collections recorded for payers that are not significant or do not have specific contractual terms 
all contractual adjustments  regardless of type of payer or method of calculation  are reviewed and compared to actual experience 
settlements under reimbursement agreements with third party payers are estimated and recorded in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known or as the service years are no longer subject to audit  review or investigation 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex  subject to interpretation and are routinely modified for provider reimbursement 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal regulations require submission of annual cost reports covering medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to program beneficiaries 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits  which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to triad under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts earned under the programs 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount in the near term 
triad also provides various levels of charity care at its facilities which are recorded as deductions to revenue 
the charity care policy varies by each facility 
triad is in the process of implementing a corporate wide charity care policy 
bad debt the largest component of bad debts in triad s patient accounts receivable is from patient responsibility accounts 
these include both amounts due from uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles for which insured patients are responsible 
each patient s insurance coverage is verified as early as possible before a scheduled admission or procedure  including eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  for all scheduled accounts so that patients can be notified of their estimated amounts due 
insurance coverage is verified within hours for all urgent and direct admissions 
to improve upfront collections  triad endeavors to collect the patient responsibility portion of amounts due at or prior to the scheduled admission or procedure 
to facilitate the upfront collection process  triad has instituted an incentive program for its employees which is based on the amount of upfront cash collections on patient responsibility accounts 
triad maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from payers inability to make payments on accounts 
triad estimates these allowances based on historical net write offs of uncollectible accounts 
triad s policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  typically no longer than one year after date of discharge 
if payers ability to pay deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
days in accounts receivable increased to days at december  from days at december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in the amount of uninsured patient receivables  which are slower payers than insured patient receivables  and medicare reimbursement delays relating to billing system issues 
days in accounts receivable decreased to days at december  from days at december  this decrease resulted from increased upfront collections and integration of the facilities acquired in the quorum merger into triad s collection methodology 
management s target days in accounts receivable was days and days at december  and  respectively 
actual days in accounts receivable did not meet management s target of primarily from an increase in the amount of uninsured patient receivables  which are slower payers than insured 
index to financial statements patient receivables  and medicare reimbursement delays relating to billing system issues 
days in accounts receivable is calculated by dividing patient receivables  excluding cost report receivables payables  less allowance for doubtful accounts by the most recent three month period s daily patient revenue  excluding prior year cost report settlements  less provision for doubtful accounts 
property  equipment and amortizable intangible assets triad evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and amortizable intangible assets and recognizes impairment losses when the fair value is less than the carrying value 
the recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined using probability weighted discounted projected future cash flows 
the fair value of assets held for sale is determined using estimated selling values 
when events  circumstances and operating results indicate that the carrying values of certain long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets might be impaired  triad prepares projections of the probability weighted undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the projections indicate that the recorded amounts are not expected to be recoverable  such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value 
indicators of potential impairment are typically beyond the control of management 
if the probability weighted cash flows become less favorable than those projected by management  impairments may be required 
goodwill triad reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
goodwill is reviewed at the reporting unit level  which is defined as one level below an operating segment 
triad estimates fair values of the reporting units using discounted projected future cash flows 
impairment is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if projected future cash flows become less favorable than those projected by management  then impairments may be required 
income taxes triad records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
triad has considered several items including ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event triad were to determine that the realization of its deferred tax asset in the future is different than its net recorded amount  an adjustment to income would be necessary 
general and professional liability risks triad self insures portions of its workers compensation  health insurance and general and professional liability insurance coverage and maintains excess loss policies 
the liabilities estimated for these self insured portions are based on actuarially determined estimates 
there are many factors that are used in determining the estimates  including amount and timing of historical payments  severity of individual cases  anticipated volume of services provided and discount rates for future cash flows 
the amounts of any ultimate actual payments for workers compensation and general and professional liability risks may not become known for several years after incurrence 
any factors changing the underlying data used in determining these estimates would result in revisions to the liabilities which could result in an adjustment to income 
contingencies triad is subject to claims and suits arising from governmental investigations and other matters in the ordinary course of business 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
triad is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of recorded liability  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the recorded liability may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters  which could result in an adjustment to income 
any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 

index to financial statements results of operations revenue volume trends triad has entered into agreements with third party payers  including government programs and managed care health plans  under which triad s facilities are paid based upon established charges  the cost of providing services  predetermined rates per diagnosis  fixed per diem rates or discounts from established charges 
triad s facilities have experienced revenue growth due to changes in patient acuity  closure of unprofitable services  favorable pricing trends and contract structure 
the increases in pricing trends and contract structure were the result of renegotiating and renewing certain managed care contracts on more favorable terms to include more stop losses  carve outs and pass throughs 
increased volumes for more intensive cases  such as inpatient surgeries  also contributed to revenue rate growth 
there can be no assurances that triad will continue to receive these levels of revenue increases in the future 
patient volumes  on a same facility basis  increased slightly in compared to  due primarily to large volume increases in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of volumes have been affected by the general weakness in the overall economy 
with health care costs increasing  many employers have increased the amounts of deductibles and co payments required by their employees 
the increase in out of pocket costs and the uncertainty of continuing employment have led to a decline in elective procedures 
if triad s volumes decrease  then its results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
triad s revenues continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of revenue being derived from fixed payment  higher discount sources  including medicare  medicaid and managed care plans 
triad expects patient volumes from medicare and medicaid to continue to increase due to the general aging of the population and expansion of state medicaid programs 
volumes from managed care plans are expected to increase due to insurance companies  government programs other than medicare and employers purchasing health care services for their employees by negotiating discounted amounts that they will pay health care providers rather than by paying standard prices 
patient revenues related to medicare and medicaid patients were  and of total patient revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
patient revenues related to managed care plan patients were  and of total patient revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
with an increasing proportion of services over the last several years being reimbursed based upon fixed payment amounts where the payment is based upon the diagnosis  regardless of the cost incurred or level of service provided  revenues  earnings and cash flows are being impacted 
mma was signed into law on december  in addition to creating a new medicare prescription drug benefit  mma provides for a number of other significant changes in the medicare program 
these changes include a reduction in the annual update for ambulatory surgery center payments from april through the third quarter of and no payment update for the fourth quarter of through mma also provides for reductions in the annual update in home health agency payments for through  and for a reduction in the annual update for inpatient hospital payments from through for hospitals that do not submit to the medicare program quality reporting data specified under the national voluntary hospital reporting initiative 
mma also includes a number of provisions designed to increase medicare payments to small urban and rural hospitals  increasing the limit on disproportionate share payments that rural hospitals may receive  and permitting an adjustment to the calculation of the standardized payment to benefit hospitals in low wage areas  such as rural hospitals and equalizes the drg base payment rate among hospitals 
triad is unable to predict the ultimate impact of mma  but no assurance can be given that it will not have an adverse effect on triad s business 
however  on a preliminary basis  triad anticipates that it may receive an additional million in reimbursement from mma in triad s revenues have been affected by the trend toward certain services being performed more frequently on an outpatient basis compared to inpatient admissions 
growth in outpatient services is expected to continue  although possibly at a slower rate  in the health care industry as procedures performed on an inpatient basis are converted to outpatient procedures through continuing advances in pharmaceutical and medical technologies 
the redirection of certain procedures to an outpatient basis is also influenced by pressures from payers and patients to perform certain procedures as outpatient care rather than inpatient care 
outpatient revenues as a percentage of patient revenues were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 

index to financial statements pressures on the rate of increase in medicare and medicaid reimbursement  increasing percentages of patient volume related to patients participating in managed care plans and continuing trends toward more services being performed on an outpatient basis are expected to present ongoing challenges 
the challenges presented by these trends are magnified by triad s inability to control these trends and the associated risks 
to maintain and improve its operating margins in future periods  triad must increase patient volumes and improve contracts while controlling the costs of providing services 
if triad is not able to achieve reductions in the cost of providing services through increased operational efficiencies  and the rate of increase in reimbursements and payments decline  results of operations and cash flows could deteriorate 
management believes that the proper response to these challenges includes the delivery of a broad range of quality health care services to physicians and patients with operating decisions being primarily made by the local management teams and local physicians with the strategic support of corporate management 
management of triad continues its focus on rationalizing its portfolio of facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  triad acquired seven new hospitals  either by acquiring all of the assets of the hospital  leasing the existing facility or entering into joint ventures with not for profit hospital partners

contingencies false claims act litigation as a result of its ongoing discussions with the government prior to the merger of quorum into triad on april   quorum learned of two qui tam complaints against it alleging violations of the false claims act for claims allegedly submitted to the government involving one owned and two managed hospitals 
quorum accrued the estimated liability on these items prior to the merger 
the matter involving the two managed hospitals remains under seal and the matter involving the owned hospital has been settled 
with respect to the matter involving the two managed hospitals  the government has requested that quorum conduct a self audit with respect to one medicare cost report for one managed hospital and three other specific issues 
the government has stated that it intends to investigate certain other allegations 
on september   triad was served with a qui tam complaint alleging  among other things  the submission of false claims for reimbursement and improper allocation of costs at a hospital in mississippi managed by qhr  which is named as an additional defendant 
the federal government has elected not to intervene in the case and the complaint was recently unsealed 
while triad intends to vigorously defend this matter  triad is not yet able to form a view as to any probable liability for any of the claims alleged in the complaint 
at this time triad cannot predict the final effect or outcome of the ongoing investigations or qui tam action 
if violations of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or other government programs are found  then triad may be required to pay substantial fines and civil and criminal damages and also may be excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs 
similarly  the amount of damages sought in the qui tam actions or in the future may be substantial 
triad could be subject to substantial costs resulting from defending  or from an adverse outcome in  any current or future investigations  administrative proceedings or litigation 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  triad may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts paid to settle any of these matters may be material 
agreements entered into as a part of any settlement could also materially adversely affect triad 
any current or future investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 

index to financial statements from time to time  triad may be the subject of additional investigations or a party to additional litigation which alleges violations of law 
triad may not know about those investigations or about qui tam actions filed against it unless and to the extent such are unsealed 
if any of those matters were successfully asserted against triad  there could be a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial position  results of operations or prospects 
income taxes the irs is in the process of conducting an examination of the federal income tax returns of triad for the calendar years ended december  and  and the federal income tax returns of quorum for the fiscal years ended june  and although the examinations are still ongoing  the irs has proposed several adjustments to which triad has consented 
the nature of the proposed adjustments relate to carryover adjustments from previous audit settlements of quorum and to adjustments proposed by triad to correct various tax accounting matters 
in the opinion of management  the proposed adjustments will not have a material effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
the irs has proposed adjustments with respect to partnership returns of income for certain joint ventures in which quorum owned a majority interest for the fiscal years ended june  and the most significant adjustments involve the tax accounting methods adopted for computing bad debt expense  the valuation of purchased hospital property and equipment and related depreciable lives  income recognition related to cost reports and the loss calculation on a taxable liquidation of a subsidiary 
triad has filed protests on behalf of the joint ventures with the appeals division of the irs contesting substantially all of the proposed adjustments  and triad has since been negotiating with the appeals division in an effort to resolve these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate outcome of the irs examinations will not have a material effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
hca litigation and investigations hca was the subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating to the business practices of hca and its subsidiaries  including subsidiaries that  prior to the spin off from hca  owned facilities now owned by triad 
these investigations were concluded through a series of agreements executed in and hca remains a defendant in qui tam actions on behalf of the united states alleging  in general  submission of improper claims to the government for reimbursement 
the lawsuits seek three times the amount of damages caused to the united states by the submission of any medicare or medicaid false claims presented by the defendants to the federal government  civil damages of not less than  nor more than  for each such medicare or medicaid claim  attorneys fees and costs 
hca has disclosed that of the original qui tam actions  the us department of justice intervened in eight actions that were settled in june the settlement agreement does not affect qui tam cases in which the government has not intervened 
hca also has previously disclosed that it is aware of additional qui tam actions that remain under seal and believes that there may be other sealed qui tam cases of which it is unaware 
hca is also the subject of a formal order of investigation by the sec 
hca understands that the sec s investigation includes the anti fraud  insider trading  periodic reporting and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws 
triad is unable to predict the effect or outcome of the ongoing sec investigation or qui tam actions  or whether any additional investigations or litigation will be commenced 
in connection with the spin off from hca  triad entered into a distribution agreement with hca 
the terms of the distribution agreement provide that hca will indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed to indemnify triad for any losses other than consequential damages which it may incur as a result of proceedings which may be commenced by government authorities or by private parties in the future that arise from acts  practices or omissions engaged in prior to the date of the spin off and that relate to the proceedings described above 
hca has also agreed that  in the event that any hospital owned by triad at the time of the spin off is permanently excluded from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of the proceedings described above  then hca will make a cash payment to triad in an amount if positive equal to five times the excluded hospital s income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  interest 
index to financial statements expense  management fees  impairment of long lived assets  minority interest and income taxes  as set forth on a schedule to the distribution agreement  less the net proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the excluded hospital 
hca will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for losses relating to any acts  practices and omissions engaged in by triad after the spin off date  whether or not triad is indemnified for similar acts  practices and omissions occurring prior to the spin off 
hca also will not indemnify triad under the distribution agreement for similar qui tam litigation  governmental investigations and other actions to which quorum was subject  some of which are described above 
if indemnified matters were asserted successfully against triad or any of its facilities  and hca failed to meet its indemnification obligations  then this event could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
the extent to which triad may or may not continue to be affected by the investigations of hca and the initiation of additional investigations  if any  cannot be predicted 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on triad s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
general liability claims triad is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of  or interference with  physicians staff privileges 
in certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against triad  which are usually not covered by insurance 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on triad s results of operations or financial position 
effects of inflation and changing prices various federal  state and local laws have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit triad s ability to increase prices 
revenues for acute care hospital services rendered to medicare patients are established under the federal government s prospective payment system 
medicare revenues were approximately in  in  and in management believes that hospital industry operating margins have been  and may continue to be  under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix  and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the medicare program 
as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures  triad s ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited 
medicare prospective payments increased in  and and management anticipates that the average rate of increase in medicare prospective payments will be relatively consistent in health care reform in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced in or proposed by congress and some state legislatures that would significantly affect health care systems in triad s markets 
the cost of certain proposals would be funded  in significant part  by a reduction in payments by government programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers 
most recently  the mma  which provides for a number of significant changes in the medicare program  was signed into law on december  triad is unable to predict whether any other proposals for health care reform will be adopted  and there can be no assurance that proposals adverse to the business of triad will not be adopted 
in december  cms acting under hipaa released final regulations which required compliance by april  relating to adoption of standards to protect the security and privacy of health related information

these regulations were published in february and require compliance by april these regulations require healthcare providers to implement organization and technical practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information 
the privacy regulations extensively 
index to financial statements regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health related information 
the privacy regulations and the security regulations could impose significant costs on triad in order to comply with these standards 
violations of the regulations could result in civil penalties of up to  per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal penalties of up to  per violation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk triad is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates  triad entered into two interest rate swaps 
interest rate swaps are contracts which allow the parties to exchange fixed and floating rate interest rate payments periodically over the life of the agreements 
floating rate payments are based on libor and fixed rate payments are dependent upon market levels at the time the interest rate swap was consummated 
the interest rate swaps were entered into as cash flow hedges  which effectively converts a notional amount of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
triad s policy is to not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes and to avoid derivatives with leverage features 
the interest rate swaps are with the same counterparty 
triad is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty 
the counterparty is a creditworthy financial institution and it is anticipated that the counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligation under the contracts 
triad entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the term of the interest rate swap expired on january  triad paid a rate of and received libor  which was set at at december  triad entered into another interest rate swap agreement  which effectively converts an additional notional amount of million of floating rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings 
the term of the interest rate swap expires in june triad will pay a rate of and will receive libor  which was set at at december  with respect to triad s interest bearing liabilities  approximately million of long term debt at december  was subject to variable rates of interest  while the remaining balance in long term debt of  million at december  was subject to fixed rates of interest 
as discussed previously  million of the long term debt subject to variable rates of interest is currently protected by an interest rate swap expiring in june the estimated fair value of triad s total long term debt was  million at december  the estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term debt with the same maturities  when available  or discounted cash flows 
based on a hypothetical increase in interest rates  the potential annualized losses in future pre tax earnings would be approximately million 
the impact of such a change in interest rates on the carrying value of long term debt would not be significant 
the estimated changes to interest expense and the fair value of long term debt are determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on triad s borrowing costs and long term debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in triad s credit ratings or the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate its exposure to such change
