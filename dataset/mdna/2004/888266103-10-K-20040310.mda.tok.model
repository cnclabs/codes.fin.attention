item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition risk factors risks related to our business for discussion of legal and other matters relating to the recently announced internal and governmental investigations into whether payments involving our foreign consultants were made in violation of applicable law and related issues 
in relation to the investigations  after consideration of publicly available information of recent resolutions of other foreign corrupt practices act issues  and following discussions with legal counsel  we have recorded a million provision as of and for the year ended december   representing our estimate of potential liabilities related to this matter 
this provision was not included in the consolidated statements of operations that we previously issued in connection with our announcement of fourth quarter and full year results and filed with the sec on form k dated february  in the year ended december   titan incurred million in transaction costs related to the proposed merger  which are reflected as merger related costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
government contracts a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent upon continued funding of united states and allied government agencies  as well as continued funding of the programs targeted by our businesses 
our revenues from us government business represented approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  any significant reductions in the funding of united states government agencies or in the funding of programs targeted by our businesses could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
us government contracts are subject to termination for convenience by the government  as well as termination  reduction or modification in the event of budgetary constraints or any change in the government s requirements 
when we subcontract with prime contractors  such subcontracts are also subject to the ability of the prime contractor to perform its obligations under its prime contract 
we often have little or no control over the resources allocated by the prime contractor to the prime contract  and any failure by the prime contractor to perform its obligations under the prime contract could result in our loss of our subcontract 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived under subcontracts with prime contractors 
in addition  our contract related costs and fees  including allocated indirect costs  are subject to audits and adjustments by negotiation between us and the us government 
as part of the audit process  the government audit agency verifies that all charges made by a contractor against a contract are legitimate and appropriate 
audits may result in recalculation of contract revenues and non reimbursement of some contract costs and fees 
any audits of our contract related costs and fees could result in material adjustments to our revenues 
in addition  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations 
congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take several years 
consequently  at the outset of a major program  the contract is usually incrementally funded and additional funds are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency as congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years 
any failure of such agencies to continue to fund such contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our business with the us government and prime contractors is generally performed under cost reimbursable  fixed price or time and materials contracts 
cost reimbursable contracts for the government provide for reimbursement of costs plus the payment of a fee 
some cost reimbursable contracts include incentive fees that are awarded based on performance on the contract 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform certain work for a fixed price 
under time and materials contracts  we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and are reimbursed for travel and other direct expenses at actual costs plus applied general and administrative expense 
the following table gives the percentage of revenues realized by us from the three primary types of government contracts during the periods indicated 
year ended december  contract type time and materials cost reimbursable fixed price backlog many of our contracts with the us government are funded by the procuring agency from year to year  primarily based on its fiscal requirements 
this results in two different categories of us government backlog funded and unfunded backlog 
funded backlog consists of the aggregate contract revenues remaining to be earned by us at a given time  but only to the extent such amounts have been appropriated by congress and allocated to the contract by the procuring government agency 
although funded backlog is appropriated by congress  we cannot guarantee that cancellations or scope adjustments will not occur 
the majority of funded backlog represents contracts under the terms of which cancellation by the customer would entitle us to all or a portion of our costs incurred and potential cancellation fees 
unfunded backlog consists of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as our customers incrementally allot funding to existing contracts  whether we are acting as a prime contractor or subcontractor  and the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned on funding of new contracts awarded to us 
unfunded backlog includes priced options  which consist of the aggregate contract revenues expected to be earned as a result of a customer exercising an option period that has been specifically defined in the original contract award 
backlog is the total of the government and commercial funded and unfunded backlog 
our backlog consisted of the following approximate amounts as of the following dates as of december  backlog in thousands us government funded backlog us government unfunded backlog commercial backlog total backlog we expect to realize approximately of our december   total backlog by december  management believes that year to year comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future revenues 
the actual timing of receipt of revenues  if any  on projects included in backlog could change because many factors affect the scheduling of projects and the amount of funding of projects 
in addition  cancellations or adjustments to contracts may occur 
backlog is subject to large variations from quarter to quarter as existing contracts are renewed or new contracts are awarded 
additionally  all united states government contracts included in backlog  whether or not funded  may be terminated at the convenience of the united states government 
no assurance can be given as to when and if revenue will be realized on projects included within our backlog 
manufacturing we operate both fabrication and assembly facilities and also purchase certain components and assemblies from other suppliers 
we also use contract manufacturers for some of our products 
no one contract manufacturer or supplier accounts for a significant portion of total purchases or revenues 
with the exception of the contract manufacturer we are utilizing to manufacture and construct our x craft vessel  we do not rely on any one supplier as a single source for a material project 
while we use care in selecting our manufacturers  our use of contract manufacturers gives us less control over the reliability of supply  quality and price of products or components than if we manufactured our products ourselves 
we risk disruptions in our supply of products and components if these suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes  natural disasters  financial condition or other factors 
patents  trademarks and trade secrets our policy is to apply for patents and other appropriate statutory protection when we develop new or improved technology  although we do not rely on patent protection in the normal course of our government contract operations 
we presently hold over us and foreign issued patents  as well as a number of trademarks and copyrights 
we do not rely  however  solely on these statutory protections to protect our technology and intellectual property 
in addition to seeking patent protection for our inventions  we rely on the laws of unfair competition and trade secrets to protect our unpatented proprietary rights 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information through agreements with customers  vendors  employees and consultants 
in addition  various names used by us for our products and services have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office 
third parties could independently develop competing technology or design around our technology 
if we are unable to successfully detect infringement and enforce our rights in our technology  we may lose competitive position in the applicable market 
we cannot be certain that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the us or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
to date we have not been notified that our technologies infringe the proprietary rights of any third parties  but third parties may  in the future  claim that our current or future technologies infringe upon their proprietary rights 
in addition  third parties have and may continue to challenge the validity or enforceability of our proprietary rights 
any such claim  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in our development of technologies and products  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as a result  any such claim could harm our business and prospects 
research and development we maintain a staff of engineers  other scientific professionals and support personnel engaged in development of new applications of technology and improvement of existing products 
these programs costs are expensed as incurred 
titan funded research and development expenditures were million in the year ended december  a portion of our research and development activities during was customer funded and as such was paid for through contract revenues with an associated expense in operating expenses 
all of our customer funded research and development activity is funded under contracts with the us government and is not included in research and development expense 
government and environmental regulations we must comply with and are affected by various government regulations 
these regulations affect how we and our customers can do business and  in some instances  impose added costs to our businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in material fines and penalties or affect how we conduct our business in the future 
we are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances 
although our business is not generally involved in the handling of hazardous materials  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances or wastes  and in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
from time to time  we have been notified of violations of government and environmental regulations 
we attempt to correct these violations promptly without any material impact on our operations 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  employees  most of whom were located in the united states 
as of december   we were subject to collective bargaining agreements with respect to employees 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are satisfactory 
general information we were incorporated in delaware in our executive offices are at science park road  san diego  ca  and our telephone number is our website address is www 
titan 
com 
we make available free of charge through our website our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and all amendments for those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically furnished to the securities and exchange commission 
we also provide access on our website to our corporate governance principles our code of ethics  the charters of our audit  nominating and corporate governance  and compensation committees 
copies of these documents are available without charge to any stockholder upon written request to our corporate secretary at our headquarters address 
in addition  we will disclose on our website any changes to  or waivers from  our code of ethics 
item properties our operations facilities occupy approximately  square feet of space located primarily throughout the united states 
the large majority of the space is office space 
substantially all of our facilities are leased 
we describe our lease commitments in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the merger of titan systems corporation into the titan corporation in september  a charge of approximately million was taken in for the consolidation of various titan systems facilities into centralized locations in virginia and california 
this charge reflects the estimated losses  net of estimated sublease income  on future lease commitments of facilities with terms extending through year and representing approximately  square feet of excess space 
we have subleased certain of these facilities and continue to actively pursue additional sublease opportunities for the remaining facilities 
however  the remaining available space is in markets adversely affected by the economy and may not be subleased at attractive rates or at all 
the actual amount of estimated losses on these lease commitments could change based upon titan s ability to obtain sublease arrangements for these facilities 
item legal proceedings recently announced governmental investigations on february   we announced that representatives of lockheed martin and titan recently initiated meetings with the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission to advise of an internal review relating to certain agreements between titan and international consultants or representatives and related payments in foreign countries 
we have been sharing the results of the internal review with the department of justice and the sec 
we also announced we had learned that the sec had commenced an investigation into whether payments involving foreign consultants were made in violation of applicable law 
on march   we learned that the department of justice had opened a criminal inquiry into this matter 
we have continued our internal review relating to these issues  in cooperation with lockheed martin corporation  which is conducting a parallel review in connection with its proposed acquisition of titan 
the sec has issued a subpoena for production of documents  but has suspended actual production of documents at this time 
we intend to continue to cooperate fully with the department of justice and the sec in connection with their investigation of the matters under review 
as part of our ongoing review  we and lockheed martin learned of allegations that improper payments were made  or items of value were provided  by our consultants to foreign officials 
the alleged payments or provision of items of value  if true  raise questions concerning whether there has been a violation of the foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable law 
in the course of our investigation  information has been identified that may indicate that there have been violations of us or foreign law arising out of payments involving our foreign representatives 
these matters are subject to ongoing department of justice and sec review 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
if the government determines that unlawful payments were made  the government could take action against us and or some of our employees 
these actions could include criminal and civil fines  penalties  criminal sanctions and limitations on our or our affected businesses ability to export products or enter into future us government contracts 
information gathered as part of the internal review raises questions as to whether applicable law has been violated 
in relation to the government investigations  after consideration of factors including publicly available information of recent resolutions of other fcpa issues  and following discussions with legal counsel  we have recorded a million provision as of and for the year ended december   representing our estimate of potential liabilities related to this matter 
the ultimate resolution of this matter is dependent upon the final results of such inquiries and investigations and associated liabilities  if any  could be different from the amount currently estimated 
other proceedings on january   titan  together with its wholly owned subsidiaries  titan wireless  inc and titan africa  inc  were named as defendants in gonzales communications  inc v 
titan wireless  inc  titan africa  inc  the titan corporation  geolution international inc  mundi development  inc  a lawsuit filed in the us district court for the southern district of california 
the complaint relates to the purchase by gonzales communications of equipment and related services under an equipment purchase agreement entered into with titan wireless in june gonzales communications contends that the equipment delivered was unsatisfactory 
in the complaint  gonzales communications seeks direct damages in the amount of million plus interest  representing the amount gonzales communications alleges to have previously paid under the agreement  and consequential damages of approximately million 
to date  titan and its subsidiaries have not received payment in full under the agreement for the equipment that was delivered to gonzales communications

in october  we received a grand jury subpoena from the antitrust division of the department of justice requesting the production of documents relating to information technology services performed for the air force at hanscom air force base in massachusetts 
we have been informed that other companies who have performed such services have received subpoenas as well 
we are not aware of any illegal or inappropriate conduct  and we have been and will continue to cooperate fully with the investigation

we are not aware of any illegal or inappropriate conduct  and we are fully cooperating with the government s inquiries in these areas 
we are involved in legal actions in the normal course of our business  including audits and investigations by various governmental agencies that result from our work as a defense contractor 
titan and its subsidiaries are named as defendants in legal proceedings from time to time and third parties  including the government  may assert claims against titan from time to time 
in addition  titan has acquired companies from time to time that have legal actions pending against them at the time of acquisition 
based upon current information available to us  in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability or recovery with respect to these other actions and proceedings is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole 
however  our evaluation of the likely impact of these other actions and proceedings could change in the future  and an unfavorable outcome  depending upon the amount and timing  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a future period

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from what is discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below under the heading risk factors 
overview and outlook the titan corporation is a leading technology developer and systems integrator for the department of defense  the department of homeland security  and intelligence and other key government agencies 
we provide a range of services and systems solutions 
these solutions and services include research and development  design  installation  integration  test  logistics support  maintenance and training 
we also provide services and solutions to government agencies with sophisticated information systems 
these include information processing  information fusion  data management  and communication systems 
in addition  we develop and produce digital imaging products  sensors  lasers  electro optical systems  threat simulation training systems  intelligence electronic hardware  signal intercept systems  and complex military specific systems 
we focus on the following four markets cisr command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  transformational programs  enterprise information technology  and the war on terrorism homeland security 
during the past three years  our revenues have grown organically by using our broader capabilities to win larger  more complex and long term government contracts  and through acquisitions of other government information technology companies 
our operating margins are affected by the mix of contract types cost reimbursable  fixed price or time and materials as well as by the mix of prime contracts versus subcontracts 
significant portions of our contracts are time and materials and cost reimbursable contracts 
we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and other direct expenses under time and materials contracts and reimbursed for all actual costs  plus a fixed or incentive based fee  or profit  under cost reimbursable contracts 
the financial risks under time and material and cost reimbursable contracts generally are lower than those associated with other types of contracts  and margins are also typically lower than those on fixed price contracts 
the us government also has awarded us fixed price contracts 
such contracts carry higher financial risks because we must deliver the products  systems or contracted services at a cost below the fixed price in order to earn a profit 
of our total revenues from our government business in  approximately were generated by time and materials contracts  approximately were generated by cost reimbursable contracts  and approximately were generated by fixed price contracts 
as a result of our decision in the third quarter of to exit substantially all of our remaining commercial businesses  as discussed in discontinued operations below  and because most of our remaining operations are our government businesses  we merged our titan systems corporation subsidiary  which encompassed our primary government businesses  into the titan corporation on september  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  substantially all of our operations are aggregated into one reportable segment given the similarities of economic characteristics between the operations and the common nature of the products  services  and customers 
prior to these developments  we grouped our businesses into five business segments titan systems  titan wireless  software systems including cayenta  titan technologies and the surebeam business 
as discussed below  we are no longer reporting the results of operations by these segments  however  reference may be made to these segments in discussions of other historical information 
the following tables set forth the results of operations expressed in dollars in thousands and as a percentage of revenues for the years below consolidated financial data year ended december  revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative research and development impairment charge related to surebeam exit and restructuring charges and other acquisition and integration related charges and other merger related costs operating profit interest expense  net debt extinguishment costs loss on investments income tax provision benefit minority interests loss from discontinued operations  net cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net net income loss as a percentage of revenues year ended december  revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative research and development impairment charge related to surebeam exit and restructuring charges and other acquisition and integration related charges and other merger related costs operating profit interest expense  net debt extinguishment costs loss on investments income tax provision benefit minority interests loss from discontinued operations  net cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net net income loss results of operations fiscal years ended december    and revenues our consolidated revenues increased from million in to billion in and from billion in to billion in revenues in increased in part due to the increased work on the linguists contract with the us army s intelligence and security command  which contributed increased revenues of approximately million  and increased work on the contract to provide enterprise information technology support for the us special operations command which contributed increased revenues of approximately million 
revenues from the us navy also grew million over due to increased work on development contracts for the x craft and affordable weapons for the office of naval research 
revenues from enterprise information technology work for the navy on a worldwide intelligence network contributed increased revenues of approximately million  and enterprise architecture and decision support for the national security agency contributed revenues of approximately million to the increase 
aside from the linguist and enterprise information technology contracts mentioned above  which represent and of total revenue  respectively  no single contract accounted for more than of total revenue in the acquisitions of wave science  inc  in the third quarter of and jaycor  inc  in march of  contributed an aggregate of approximately million to the total revenue increase 
revenue growth in was primarily attributable to organic revenue growth and the impact of the acquisition of jaycor  inc  and a full year of operations generated by datron systems datron and btg  inc btg  companies acquired in the latter half of  which contributed an aggregate of approximately million to the increase in the organic revenue growth in reflects increased demand from the intelligence community and homeland security agencies  including systems integration services and cryptological equipment for us and allied intelligence agencies  vulnerability assessments and first responder operations training on homeland security contracts  and armed services technical services such as linguist support  specifically related to the war on terrorism 
increased revenues in were also driven by the ramp up of work on titan s enterprise information technology contract with the us special operations command  and work for the air force s electronic systems center on a variety of technical  engineering and acquisition support contracts 
selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses increased from million in to million in and decreased from million in to million in sg a  as a percentage of revenues  decreased from in to in and from in to in the sg a included amortization of purchased intangibles of million and deferred compensation amortization of million 
the sg a was impacted by amortization of purchased intangibles of million compared to amortization of goodwill of million in  and an increase in the amortization of deferred compensation from million in to million in the amortization of deferred compensation in includes approximately million resulting from the merger of titan s national security subsidiary  titan systems  into titan  which occurred on september   and resulted in the exchange of all outstanding titan systems stock options for titan corporation stock options 
for further details regarding deferred compensation  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in sg a from and was attributable to the decrease in amortization noted above as well as cost reduction and consolidation activities initiated in early that reduced our sg a expenses necessary to operate our business and support our revenue growth 
the decreases as a percentage of revenues in and were attributable to these cost savings as well as overall increased economies of scale with higher revenues 
research and development our r d expenses increased from million in to million in and from million in to million in r d expenses in were incurred primarily on the development of a low cost phased array radar system  secure communications devices  satellite communications modems and the hf manpack and portable radios 
the increased r d expenditures in compared to were primarily attributable to increased development expenses incurred to develop software reprogrammable modems and digital radios for military and homeland security applications 
as a percentage of revenues  r d remained at or less in all periods 
impairment charge related to surebeam prior to and in connection with the spin off of surebeam corporation  titan and surebeam entered into a number of agreements 
titan extended a million secured senior credit facility of which million in principal was advanced and is outstanding as of december  the senior credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of surebeam s assets 
in addition  titan guaranteed certain lease obligations of surebeam and subleased facilities to surebeam 
titan is surebeam s only secured lender 
the aggregate amount of the lease obligations titan has guaranteed as of december   is approximately million 
the leases extend through periods ending in the aggregate amount due to titan as of december  for future obligations under the sublease agreements for approximately  square feet for periods through is approximately million 
surebeam s obligation to reimburse titan for any amounts paid under the guarantees is secured under the senior credit facility 
on january   surebeam voluntarily filed for bankruptcy relief to be liquidated under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of this filing  we recorded an estimated pre tax impairment charge of million and an associated tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of related to the senior credit facility with surebeam as well as surebeam s other indebtedness and obligations to us 
the ultimate amount of impairment to be recognized is contingent upon the amount of actual proceeds recovered by titan from the liquidation of collateral securing the senior credit facility 
the current estimate of such proceeds  which includes estimated sales of equipment and inventory  primarily electron beam systems and other related components  is approximately million 
the ultimate impairment is also dependent upon titan s ability to mitigate its obligations under the facilities lease guarantees through subleases  and loan repayments from hawaii pride as discussed below 
the current estimate of such mitigation of obligations under leases and lease guarantees is approximately million 
the impairment charge was offset by an million liability previously accrued by titan to surebeam under a tax allocation agreement 
the actual amount of titan s losses could be lower or higher than currently estimated depending on the amount of surebeam liquidation proceeds received and the amount of net payments made under its lease guarantees issued on behalf of surebeam and bank debt guarantee related to hawaii pride 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of titan s agreements with surebeam 
on march   we entered in a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee for surebeam and its subsidiary 
the settlement agreement requires bankrutpcy court approval to become effective 
under the settlement agreement  we will have an allowed secured claim in the amount of a minimum of approximately million and a first priority perfected lien on all assets of surebeam other than certain identified assets of surebeam 
upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement  the automatic stays in the bankruptcy will be modified to permit us to exercise our rights and remedies as a secured creditor and sublessor  including the right to dispose of collateral 
as part of the settlement  we also agreed to undertake commercially reasonable efforts to collect two receivables of surebeam that by agreement are excluded from our collateral and to deliver the proceeds to the bankruptcy trustee 
in relation to surebeam s strategic alliance with hawaii pride  titan has guaranteed repayment of hawaii pride s bank debt up to the greater of surebeam s equity interest in hawaii pride which is zero  or of hawaii pride s million  year loan from its lender  webbank 
as of december   titan has guaranteed approximately million  or of the current loan balance of million 
in the event that hawaii pride defaults on the loan  titan currently expects to be obligated to cover any defaults on the entire outstanding balance of the loan if the default is not cured within days 
in late october  titan was notified by hawaii pride that hawaii pride had stopped receiving financial support from surebeam and did not have sufficient cash resources to make its monthly principal and interest payments to webbank 
through march   titan has loaned approximately million to hawaii pride under a new credit facility for a maximum amount of million to be advanced to hawaii pride to cover shortfalls in debt service payments 
all amounts outstanding under this facility are required to be repaid by may in the impairment charge discussed above  titan has assumed that hawaii pride will repay amounts advanced on the new credit facility 
exit and restructuring charges and other included in the year ended december   is million of restructuring costs related to the merger of titan systems into titan on september   and exit charges related to the shutdown of cayenta s headquarters office 
approximately million of these exit charges are related to the shutdown of the cayenta headquarters office and network operations center  which includes employee termination costs and other liabilities of approximately million  lease commitment costs of approximately million  and non cash asset impairment charges of approximately million relating primarily to the unamortized leasehold improvements and other fixed assets at the cayenta headquarters 
the remaining lease commitment costs are expected to be paid through future periods ending in january included in the employee termination costs are personnel reductions 
approximately million of the restructuring charges were related to the merger of titan systems into titan and other associated reorganization and consolidation costs 
the costs included approximately million for the consolidation of various titan systems facilities into centralized locations in virginia and california 
this charge reflects the estimated losses  net of estimated sublease income  on future lease commitments of facilities with terms extending through year titan has subleased certain of these facilities and continues to actively pursue additional sublease opportunities for the remaining facilities 
however  the remaining available space is in markets adversely affected by the economy and may not be subleased at attractive rates or at all 
the actual amount of estimated losses on these lease commitments could change based upon titan s ability to obtain sublease arrangements for these facilities 
included in the employee termination costs are personnel reductions 
approximately million of the titan systems restructuring costs are primarily related to employee termination costs  employee retention costs  duplicate transition costs and professional fees related to acquisitions and certain reorganization and consolidation activities within titan systems 
the remaining million is related to direct transaction costs incurred by titan in connection with acquisitions that did not close  primarily the proposed acquisition with science and engineering associates  inc at december   accruals for all exit and restructuring charges totaled million  comprised primarily of restructuring charges related to the merger of titan systems into titan on september  and exit charges related to the shutdown of cayenta s headquarters office 
these exit and restructuring activities were accounted for under eitf issue no 
 which allowed accrual of restructuring costs upon commitment to a plan and certain other criteria 
effective january   titan was required to adopt sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to defer recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity until that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
as these restructuring activities were entered into prior to our adoption of sfas no 
 titan has accounted for these activities under eitf a summary of exit and restructuring charges and other recorded and the utilization of those accruals during the years ended december  and is as follows charges recorded in asset disposals cash paid balance december  cash paid balance december  titan systems restructuring estimated facilities consolidation costs employee termination retention costs and other transaction costs for unsuccessful deals cayenta headquarters exit costs lease commitment costs asset impairment costs employee termination costs and other at december   million of the exit and restructuring accruals are included in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and million are included in other non current liabilities 
the remaining accrual balance is primarily comprised of amounts due under the facilities consolidation  which requires payments in for certain lease cancellation fees and other lease costs  net of assumed sublease income  with the remainder expected to be paid over the remaining lease terms  which expire in acquisition and integration related charges and other acquisition and integration related charges and other of million in included million related to the integration of acs and averstar and other restructuring and realignment activities in our government business  a million impairment charge for fixed assets associated with cayenta s network operations center and million related to other asset impairments and restructuring activities associated with cayenta s headquarters office  and million related to personnel reductions in cayenta s federal government business  which is now a part of titan s government business 
liabilities of million related to the charges remained at december   which were paid in merger related costs merger related costs in of million are comprised of transaction costs related to the proposed merger between titan and lockheed martin 
operating profit consolidated 
our operating profit decreased from million in to million in and increased from million in to million in our operating profits have been significantly impacted by a number of factors in each of  and the operating results include the acquisition and integration related charges and other of million noted above  and the operating results include the exit and restructuring charges and other of million noted above 
the operating results include an impairment charge related to surebeam of million and million of merger related costs  as noted above 
also impacting the results in each year was amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles of million in  million in  and million in and deferred compensation amortization of million in  million in and million in operating income in and increased primarily due to the increased revenue volume discussed previously  as well as an increase in operating margins primarily resulting from economies of scale and specific cost containment initiatives 
interest expense  net our net interest expense decreased from million in to million in and increased from million in to million in borrowings from our primary bank credit facility  excluding working capital lines from acquired companies  averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of during  million at a weighted average interest rate of during  and million at a weighted average interest rate of during interest expense in compared to reflects reduced interest expense on our credit facility resulting from the reduced interest rates  offset by increased interest expense on million in senior subordinated notes issued in may  the proceeds of which were used to redeem million in high tides 
the reduction in interest expense in as compared to reflects lower average interest rates on our primary bank credit facility 
also included in interest expense is interest on our deferred compensation plan and retiree medical obligations 
interest expense related to these items was million for  million for  and million for loss on investments the loss on investments of million in relates to an unrealized loss on the carrying value of our investment in etenna corporation based upon recent indications of fair value  and includes an unrealized loss on our investment in doar communications that was subsequently sold at a loss in january income taxes consolidated income taxes reflect effective rates of a provision of in reflecting a million provision on a pre tax loss of million  a benefit of in  and a provision of in the provision in on a pre tax loss was due to the impact of the relationship of significant permanent non deductible items compared to the book loss for the period 
the reduced benefit rate in as compared to the statutory tax rate reflects the effect of additional state taxes due to separate state filings 
due to titan s return to profitability in  the consolidated income taxes now reflect a tax provision compared to the tax benefit in the increased provision rate in reflects the non deductibility of certain losses and costs incurred in loss from discontinued operations our loss from discontinued operations includes the results of operations for our titan wireless business  certain components of our cayenta business  our avercom business  our lincom wireless business and surebeam which was spun off in august 
excluded from the loss from discontinued operations is a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill which was recorded on january  when titan adopted sfas no 
 which has been reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
following is a summary of the operating results for the discontinued operations 
year ended december  gain on sale of business impairment of goodwill impairment of fixed assets and other exit charges losses from operations tax benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes the tax benefit was impacted by the globalnet sale for which a tax provision was not provided due to prior losses  as well as a tax benefit to adjust the carrying value of certain assets which are currently held for sale in titan s remaining commercial information technology business that was previously part of titan technologies 
titan wireless discontinued july  in july  our board of directors made the decision to exit all of our international telecommunications business through a combination of selling or winding down the operations within our titan wireless segment 
titan immediately began implementing these actions  which were substantially completed during titan has reported this exit of the titan wireless segment as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
revenues for titan wireless were million and net income was million for the year ended december  the revenues were primarily generated by the globalnet business prior to the sale of this business in the third quarter of the net income was primarily a result of the gain of million from the disposition of the globalnet business  resulting from a previous write down of the carrying value of the net assets  for which a tax provision was not provided due to prior losses 
the gain was offset by impairment charges of million resulting from the terms of the settlement agreements with titan s customers in nigeria and benin  and by approximately million of charges accrued for the exit activities in benin 
on december   our wholly owned subsidiary  titan africa  inc titan africa  in connection with its contract to build a satellite based telephone system for its customer  the national telephone company of benin  africa the opt  entered into a loan facility agreement for up to billion francs cfa the currency of the african financial community  equivalent to approximately million us dollars  with a syndicate of five banks  with africa merchant bank as the arranger 
this financing was subsequently increased by billion francs cfa to approximately million 
this medium term financing is a non recourse loan to titan africa which is guaranteed by the national telephone company of benin  africa and secured by the national telephone company s equipment and revenues related to the project 
the facility has a fixed interest rate of per year and was originally to be repaid in seven equal semi annual payments from the net receipts of this project  or by the opt in the event that such receipts are not adequate to make these payments  which commenced on december  and were scheduled to end on december  the payment terms were subsequently amended calling for quarterly payments through mid the borrowings on this facility have been utilized to fund various equipment and subcontractor costs incurred most notably by alcatel of france  a major subcontractor to this project 
related to titan s contract with the opt  titan has a million gross receivable due from the opt  which is reflected in current assets of discontinued operations as of december  of this amount  approximately million is recorded as a receivable on the project  reflecting the outstanding balance on the non recourse loan  drawn to cover subcontract costs 
the remaining million net receivable represents amounts due from the opt under the titan settlement agreement entered into with the opt 
titan entered into the settlement agreement with the opt in october pursuant to which titan was to be paid million in full satisfaction of titan s performance on the opt contract  of which million remains outstanding as of december  in the second quarter of  titan sold its interest in ivoire telecom sa for approximately million cash consideration 
in the third quarter of  titan completed the sale of its globalnet business 
payments received for the sale of globalnet consisted of approximately million in cash  notes receivable of approximately million  and the buyer s assumption of all of the outstanding liabilities of globalnet  which aggregated to approximately million at the time of the consummation of the sale 
titan has collected approximately million of the amounts due under the notes receivable  and expects to collect the remaining million in the first quarter of also during the third quarter of  titan settled and accelerated the collection of its receivable due from its customer in nigeria  resulting in an aggregate cash collection of approximately million in cayenta discontinued march previously included in our software systems segment in july  the two information technology businesses of cayenta were sold  for cash received to date of million 
surebeam discontinued october titan discontinued the surebeam segment in the third quarter of  and in the third quarter of  titan completed a tax free spin off transaction in which all of titan s shares of surebeam corporation were distributed to titan stockholders 
in  we recorded an estimated pre tax impairment charge of million related to surebeam s indebtedness to titan 
see the discussion in impairment charge related to surebeam above for further details 
titan technologies in august  our board of directors made the decision to sell or otherwise divest our lincom wireless business and to sell our remaining commercial information technology business  both of which were previously reported in our titan technologies segment 
accordingly  titan has reflected both operations as discontinued in accordance with sfas no 
in october  the lincom wireless business was shut down 
the avercom business  discontinued in the first quarter of  was sold in july the remaining commercial information technology business is currently held for sale 
in accordance with sfas no 
 all commercial operations that have been sold or that are held for sale have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in titan s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
contains criteria that must be met for businesses to be classified as held for sale and recorded as discontinued operations 
management periodically re evaluates those criteria for businesses held for sale  and if such criteria are no longer met  we would be required to reclassify the operations and assets and liabilities of non qualifying businesses into continuing operations 
management believes that all businesses currently held for sale meet this criteria and  therefore  have been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations 
net income loss we reported net loss of million in  net loss of million in  and net income of million in included in the net results for  and are net losses from discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the discontinued operations in these years include surebeam through spin off date in  certain components of our cayenta business  our avercom business  our titan wireless business  and our lincom wireless business 
the net income includes an estimated impairment charge of million related to our former subsidiary  surebeam corporation  and a loss on investments of million 
debt extinguishment costs of million and million are included in the net results for and  respectively 
included in the net loss for is a charge of million  net of tax  for titan s adoption of sfas no 
 which is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
also included in the  and results are goodwill and or purchased intangibles amortization of million  million and million  respectively  deferred compensation charges and amortization of million  million and million  respectively  and exit and restructuring and other charges  integration  acquisition related charges and other  and merger related costs of million  million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash of approximately million from our continuing operations during the year ended december   primarily resulting from our core government business  net of an increase in receivable balances of approximately million 
the increase in accounts receivable balances primarily reflects the growth in revenues over the past year 
our investing activities used net cash of approximately million  primarily for the acquisition of advent for a net cash outlay of approximately million  capital expenditures of approximately million and investments of million 
financing activities used million  primarily due to the redemption of the million high tides  offset by the issuance of million subordinated notes 
at the time of the redemption  we borrowed million on our revolving credit facility to fund the redemption  which we repaid from cash flows from operations prior to december  in addition  deferred debt issuance costs related to the senior subordinated notes and extinguishment costs of the high tides  were million in total 
offsetting these uses were the proceeds from stock issuances  primarily the exercise of stock options  which provided million 
the proceeds from option exercises is an increase of over the previous year  which management believes was attributable to option holders anticipation of the proposed merger with lockheed martin 
at december   total borrowings under our senior credit facility were million at a weighted average interest rate of 
commitments under letters of credit were million at december   which reduces availability of our senior credit facility  resulting in million of borrowing availability on the senior revolving credit facility at december  of the total borrowings  million was short term 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
on may   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due may  in a private placement the notes 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  plus borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility and additional cash on hand  to redeem all of the million of the then outstanding high tides convertible preferred securities 
the redemption of high tides occurred on june  in what it considered favorable corporate bond market conditions  management made the decision to refinance the high tides to eliminate the interest rate risk and potential dilution to stockholders associated with the mandatory remarketing feature of the high tides 
we incurred approximately million in charges in related to the extinguishment of the high tides  comprised of the write off of million of remaining deferred debt issuance costs of high tides  a call premium of million to redeem the high tides  and approximately million of interest during the call period 
all extinguishment charges were recorded in the second quarter of as a charge to income from continuing operations 
following the redemption of the high tides  availability on the working capital line was reduced by million for the borrowings on our revolving line of credit for the borrowings required to complete the redemption 
we are required to make interest payments on the notes semi annually in arrears on may and november at the rate of per annum 
the first scheduled interest payment for the outstanding notes was made on november  we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  on or after may  at the following redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any year percentage and thereafter the notes are unsecured and rank or will rank equally with our current or future senior subordinated indebtedness 
each of titan s domestic subsidiaries other than cayenta guarantees the notes 
the guarantees are unsecured and rank equally with each guarantor s senior subordinated indebtedness 
the notes and the guarantees are junior to all of titan s and each guarantor s senior indebtedness and senior to all of titan s and each guarantor s subordinated indebtedness 
in connection with its proposed merger with lockheed martin  on february   titan commenced an offer to exchange the existing notes for a new series of substantially identical senior subordinated notes registered under the securities act of and a consent solicitation relating to proposed amendments to the indenture governing the notes described in note to the consolidated financial statements and the termination of the registration rights agreement titan delivered in may for the benefit of the holders of the notes 
titan announced on february  that it had received the requisite consents from the holders of more than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes to effect the proposed amendments to the indenture and the termination of the registration rights agreement 
accordingly  titan has entered into a supplemental indenture with the indenture trustee to effect the amendments to the indenture and has entered into an amendment to the registration rights agreement providing for its termination  however  the amendments and the termination of the registration rights agreement will not become operative until immediately prior to the completion of the proposed merger with lockheed martin 
if the merger is completed  lockheed martin will guarantee the surviving entity s obligations as the obligor of the notes 
if the merger is not completed  the amendments will not become operative 
until that point  the indenture and the registration rights agreement  without giving effect to the proposed amendments or the termination of the registration rights agreement  will remain in effect 
the receipt of the requisite consents and the execution of the supplemental indenture satisfy one of the conditions to the closing of the proposed merger with lockheed martin 
in the third quarter of  titan completed the sale of its globalnet business 
payments received for the sale of globalnet consisted of approximately million in cash  notes receivable of approximately million  and the buyer s assumption of all of the outstanding liabilities of globalnet  which aggregated to approximately million at the time of the consummation of the sale 
titan has collected approximately million of the amounts due under the notes receivable  and expects to collect the remaining million in the first quarter of also during the third quarter of  titan settled and accelerated the collection of its receivable due from its customer in nigeria  resulting in an aggregate cash collection of approximately million 
we used million for discontinued operations in due primarily to payments for vendor and lease obligations  infusion of working capital  exit costs  and for operating losses  net of proceeds from the sale of globalnet and other discontinued operations of approximately million and collections of approximately million on our receivables from customers in nigeria and benin  africa 
in addition  we incurred million for a deferred payment related to a prior year acquisition see note to our consolidated financial statements deferred costs and expenses of million related to the senior credit facility are included in other assets at december  and will be amortized over the remaining term of the senior credit facility 
deferred costs and expenses of million related to the issuance of the notes are also included in other assets at december   and will be amortized over the term of the notes 
except as discussed related to surebeam above in impairment charge related to surebeam  there are no titan guarantees of debt  either directly or indirectly  other than approximately million of equipment financing associated with ivoire telecom 
on february   titan announced that all outstanding shares of its cumulative convertible preferred stock will be redeemed at pm  new york city time  on march  the redemption is being undertaken in anticipation of and as a condition to the close of the proposed merger with lockheed martin but is not contingent on the merger closing 
the convertible preferred shares are redeemable at titan s option at a redemption price of per share  plus cumulative dividends in arrears  for an aggregate redemption price of per share 
titan will redeem the shares using available cash balances 
the preferred stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ttn pr and closed at per share on march  holders of titan s convertible preferred stock also have an existing right to convert each of their shares into shares of titan s common stock 
the right to convert the convertible preferred stock will terminate at pm  new york city time  on march   the date of redemption 
as of february   there were  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
to the extent that all of these shares are converted  then approximately  shares of titan common stock would be issued 
any shares of convertible preferred stock that are not converted will be redeemed 
approximately million of cash will be required to redeem all outstanding shares 
in relation to our acquisition of international systems in  additional consideration may be payable in through based upon earnings levels achieved 
as of december   approximately million additional consideration was accrued for earnings in  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of in addition  in relation to our acquisition of wave science  additional consideration of million was accrued as of december   and has been paid in the first quarter of refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
in relation to the current investigation by the sec and department of justice into whether payments involving foreign consultants were made in violation of applicable law  we may be required to pay certain liabilities in the future related to this matter 
the company has recorded a million provision as of december   representing our estimate of potential liabilities related to this matter 
the ultimate resolution of this matter is dependent upon the final results of such inquiries and investigations and associated liabilities if any  could be different from the amount currently estimated 
we plan to finance our operations and working capital from a combination of sources  which include cash generation from our core businesses  our credit facility and potential cash generated from the disposal of discontinued businesses 
management believes that the combination of our existing cash  amounts available under our credit facility and cash flow expected to be generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund planned investments  the planned redemption of the preferred stock  the payment of additional consideration on acquisitions  potential liabilities related to the current government investigation and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months if the proposed merger with lockheed martin is not consummated 
under the merger agreement  we are prohibited from raising additional capital 
should the merger be delayed or terminated  we could elect  or we could be required  to raise additional funds during that period and we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
additional capital may not be available at all  or may not be available on terms favorable to us 
any additional issuance of equity or equity linked securities may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
management is continually monitoring and reevaluating its level of investment in all of its operations and the financing sources available to achieve our goals 
contractual obligations and other commitments our contractual cash obligations as of december   including principal maturities of long term debt and other commitments  were as follows  excluding non recourse debt and interest payments due by period thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt senior credit facility other senior subordinated notes other contractual obligations operating leases capital leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations amount of commitment expiration per period thereafter total other commitments guarantees facilities guarantees on behalf of surebeam titan facilities subleased to surebeam bank guarantee related to hawaii pride standby letters of credit total commitments purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including  fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
subcontractor commitments related to customer contracts are included to the extent that we have received funding from the customer for the related tasks that the subcontractor is to perform 
the amounts in this table represent total potential contingent liabilities under the guarantees 
as discussed above in impairment charge related to surebeam  the ultimate amount of net cash outlays will be contingent upon the amount of actual proceeds recovered by titan from the liquidation of collateral securing the senior credit facility with titan  titan s ability to mitigate its obligations under the facilities lease guarantees through subleases  and loan repayments from hawaii pride 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
these reserves are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts and included in bad debt expense 
these reserves are based on potential uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  historical losses  and our customers credit worthiness 
we also record reserves against receivables for estimated adjustments to revenue that may result from changes in expected government funding on certain of our contracts and adjustments that may arise from audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa of certain of our government contracts 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally will place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments and or services provided to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account in our discontinued operations would be principally dependent on a deterioration in economic and or political conditions in a particular country  such as benin  africa  in which our receivables due from the government controlled phone company of benin may be impacted by such an event  or in the middle east  in which our receivables due from a government agency in the middle east may be impacted by political conditions 
our accounts receivable balances include unbilled receivables which are comprised of work in process which will be billed in accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules  as well as amounts billable upon final execution of contracts  contract completion  milestones or completion of rate negotiations 
payments to us for performance on certain of our us government contracts are subject to audit by the dcaa  and are subject to government funding 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from rate negotiations  audit adjustments  and or government funding availability 
to the extent that actual adjustments due to rate negotiations  audit adjustments  or government funding availability differ from our estimates  our revenue may be impacted 
due to a high degree of diversification in our government business  the likelihood of a material loss to titan on an uncollectible account from this activity is not probable 
inventory 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the components of our inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
determining impairment losses on non marketable securities 
we evaluate our investment in non marketable securities taking into consideration the financial condition of the investee  the near term prospects of the investee  including the opportunities in the region and industry of the investee  changes in technology  the progress of the investee in achieving operational milestones according to its operating plan  and indications of implied fair value as a result of recent financing transactions 
we also evaluate various alternatives relative to realizing the value of our investment 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our evaluation of whether there is a decline other than temporary include significant changes in the investee s ability to generate positive cash flow  a significant change in technology  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset or a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the investee depends 
impairment charge related to surebeam 
we estimated the impairment charge related to surebeam based upon assumptions we made regarding estimated proceeds we expect to recover from the liquidation of collateral  securing surebeam s indebtedness and other obligations to us under the senior secured credit facility 
we estimated these proceeds based upon discounted sales values we believe the surebeam equipment and inventory  primarily electron beam systems and other related components  can be sold for to third parties 
we based these discounted sales values on recent sales prices as well as preliminary indications of interest from third parties 
we evaluated the obligations due under the guarantee and lease agreements by taking into consideration the estimated sublease income and cash flows anticipated from all sources 
we estimated the net amounts owed under the facilities lease agreements and lease guarantees issued on behalf of surebeam by taking into consideration the estimated sublease income based on current market lease property values 
related to the bank guarantee we issued on behalf of hawaii pride  we evaluated the estimated cash flow to be generated from the operations of hawaii pride to determine the estimated amount that we may be required to loan to hawaii pride to enable it to make its debt payments 
we did not take into consideration the potential proceeds resulting from a sale of the intellectual property of surebeam or any risks regarding potential attempts to set aside our liens on the collateral 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our long lived assets and goodwill 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions  particularly in which we have investments 
benefit plans 
we provide for limited postretirement medical benefit obligations of operations discontinued in prior years for former employees and for certain current senior executive officers 
accounting and reporting for the pension plans requires the use of assumptions for discount rates  expected mortality rates and estimated growth rates in medical and healthcare costs all assumptions our actuaries rely upon in preparing their estimates for us 
any materially different valuations for actuarial assumptions that are different from our current expectations could impact our accruals for these postretirement benefit obligations 
as the population that participates in these plans is limited  we do not believe changes in valuations would have a material impact on our provisions for these postretirement obligations 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the amount of the net deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
also  under federal tax law  certain potential changes in ownership of titan may limit annual future utilization of these carryforwards 
as such  the valuation allowance recorded is provided against certain carryforwards which may not be utilized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations and or divestitures 
revenue recognition 
we recognize a portion of our revenue using the percentage of completion method  which includes revenues recognized as costs are incurred or as output measures are identified  in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project based upon evaluation of the level of work achieved and costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenues recorded under such contracts could materially be affected and could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future periods 
in  approximately of our total revenues were generated by fixed price contracts  which are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
the remaining of our revenues in were generated by cost reimbursable contracts and time and materials contracts  for which percentage of completion is not used  and revenues are generally recognized as work is performed and billed to the customer 
titan contracts with its government customers using various cost type contracts 
they include cost plus fixed fee  cost plus award fee  cost plus incentive fee with incentives based upon both cost and or performance  and cost sharing contracts 
revenues and profits are recognized in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
and sop for award and incentive fee type contracts  we recognize the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated  based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding our performance  including any interim performance evaluations rendered by the customer 
revenues are recognized under fixed price contracts based on the percentage of completion basis  using the cost to cost or units of delivery methods 
on occasion we receive unpriced and priced change orders from our customers  whereby we are requested to make modifications to the contract  which may include changes in specifications or design  method or manner of performance  equipment  materials  and period for completion of work 
some change orders are unpriced  that is  the work to be performed is defined  but the adjustment to the contract price is to be negotiated later 
we evaluate these change orders according to their characteristics and the circumstances in which they occur after taking all factors into consideration such as probability of recovery  our experience in negotiating change orders  and separate documentation for change order costs that are identifiable and reasonable 
we record the costs and associated revenue as appropriate  in accordance with sop accounting for business combinations 
in relation to our allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and contingencies assumed in acquisitions accounted for as purchase transactions  management makes estimates of such amounts as the fair value of assets and contingencies assumed 
to the extent that the actual values or contingencies may differ from the estimates used  our allocation of purchase price may differ  which may result in a change to the amount of goodwill and or purchased intangibles 
management also obtains an independent purchase valuation to assist in its purchase price allocation 
principles of consolidation 
management evaluates its investment in each joint venture and investment on an individual basis for purposes of determining whether consolidation or the cost or equity method is appropriate  based upon management s evaluation of the level of our ability to retain and exercise control through decision making ability and exercise significant influence  as well as our equity ownership interest 
in the event that our ability to obtain control and exercise significant influence changes materially from management s evaluation in determining whether consolidation should occur  or whether or not the cost or equity method is appropriate  then our operating results could be materially impacted  either positively or negatively

cautionary statements in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements in this report or otherwise within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and section a of the securities act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are all statements other than historical facts and relate to future events or our future financial and or operating performance and can be generally identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as may  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates  expects  estimates  predicts  potential  possible  continue  or opportunity  the negative of these words or words of similar import 
similarly  statements that describe our reserves  our estimates  and our future plans  strategies  intentions  expectations  objectives  goals or prospects are also forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our expectations and projections about future events and future trends affecting our business and so are subject to risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties described below  that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this report 
in addition  past financial or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date of this report 
risks relating to our business we may not complete the proposed merger with lockheed martin as scheduled or at all 
the completion of the proposed merger with lockheed martin requires the approval of our stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of several other closing conditions 
among these is that there not have occurred a material adverse change  circumstance  fact  event or effect that  individually or in the aggregate with all other adverse changes  circumstances  facts  events and effects  is or is reasonably likely to be materially adverse to the business  condition financial or otherwise  assets or results of operations of titan and its consolidated subsidiaries  taken as a whole 
lockheed martin has stated that  if the internal reviews being conducted by it and titan  the sec s investigation and the criminal inquiry being undertaken by the department of justice are not completed by the date of the special meeting of titan stockholders for consideration of the proposed merger  lockheed martin will have to consider whether all of the conditions to the closing of the merger are met 
lockheed martin has not given any assurances as to whether it will be satisfied that the preliminary results of the internal reviews and the ongoing nature of the sec investigation and department of justice criminal inquiry do not constitute a material adverse change in titan 
accordingly  pending favorable resolution of these matters on or prior to march   the date scheduled for the special meeting of titan stockholders for consideration of the proposed merger  titan cannot provide any assurances that the merger will be completed as scheduled on that date 
if the merger is not completed by march   either lockheed martin or titan may terminate the merger agreement  provided that the party seeking to terminate the agreement is not then in material breach of its obligations under the merger agreement 
if the proposed merger is not completed  our stock price  which has traded since the announcement of the merger in september close to the announced price that lockheed martin agreed to pay per share  would likely decline 
the inability to complete the merger would also likely result in litigation  which could be costly and could divert the attention of management 
in addition  our results of operations for the first quarter of would likely be adversely affected by costs related to the government and internal investigations and merger related activities 
as a result of the government s investigation into whether payments involving foreign consultants were made in violation of applicable law and related issues  the government could take action against us and or some of our employees 
as a result of the current investigation by the sec and the department of justice  if the government determines that unlawful payments were made  the government could take action against us and or some of our employees 
these actions could include criminal and civil fines  penalties  criminal sanctions and limitations on our or our affected businesses abilities to export products or enter into future us government contracts 
as of december   we have recorded a million provision related to these matters 
we may be required to record an additional provision or reduce this provision if the actual settlement amount of these matters differs from the current provision 
titan depends on government contracts for most of its revenues and the loss of government contracts or a decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could adversely affect titan s revenues and cash flows and titan s ability to fund its growth 
titan s revenues from us government business represented approximately of titan s total revenues in titan s us government contracts are only funded on an annual basis  and the us government may cancel these contracts at any time without penalty or may change its requirements  programs or contract budget or decline to exercise option periods  any of which could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows from us government contracts 
titan s revenues and cash flow from us government contracts could also be reduced by declines in us defense  homeland security and other federal agency budgets 
approximately of titan s revenue in was for products and services under contracts with various parts of the us navy  us air force or us army or with prime contractors to the us navy  us air force or us army 
although these various parts of the us navy  us air force or us army are subject to common budgetary pressures and other factors  titan s various us navy  us air force or us army customers exercise independent purchasing decisions 
however  because of such concentration of titan s contracts  titan is vulnerable to adverse changes in its revenues and cash flows if a significant number of titan s us navy  us air force or us army contracts and subcontracts are simultaneously delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons 
in addition to contract cancellations and declines in agency budgets  titan may be adversely affected by curtailment of the u 
s government s use of technology services and products providers  and technological developments that impact purchasing decisions or titan s competive position 
these or other factors could cause us defense and other federal agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts or not to exercise options to renew contracts or limit titan s ability to obtain new contract awards 
any of these actions or any of the other actions described above could reduce titan s revenues and cash flows 
government audits of titan s government contracts could result in a material charge to titan s earnings and have a negative effect on titan s cash position following an audit adjustment 
titan s government contracts are subject to cost audits by the government 
these audits may occur several years after the period to which the audits relate 
if a cost audit were to identify significant unallowable costs  titan could have a material charge to its earnings or reduction in its cash position as a result of an audit  including an audit of one of the companies titan has acquired 
some of titan s acquired companies did not historically impose internal controls as rigorous as those titan imposes on the government contracts titan performs  which may increase the likelihood that an audit of their government contracts could cause a charge to titan s earnings or reduction in titan s cash position 
titan s operating margins may decline under its fixed price contracts if titan fails to estimate accurately the time and resources necessary to satisfy titan s obligations 
some of titan s contracts are fixed price contracts under which titan bears the risk of any cost overruns 
titan s profits are adversely affected if its costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions titan used in bidding for the contract 
in  approximately of titan s revenues were derived from fixed price contracts for both defense and non defense related government contracts 
often  titan is required to fix the price for a contract before titan finalizes the project specifications  which increases the risk that titan will mis price these contracts 
the complexity of many of titan s engagements makes accurately estimating titan s time and resources more difficult 
if titan is not able to retain its contracts with the us government and subcontracts under us government prime contracts in the competitive rebidding process  titan s revenues may suffer 
upon expiration of a us government contract or subcontract under a us government prime contract  if the government customer requires further services of the type provided in the contract  there is frequently a competitive rebidding process 
titan cannot guarantee that titan  or if titan is a subcontractor that the prime contractor  will win any particular bid  or that titan will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract 
further  all us government contracts are subject to protest by competitors 
the termination of several of titan s significant contracts or nonrenewal of several of titan s significant contracts could result in significant revenue reductions 
titan may be liable for penalties under a variety of procurement rules and regulations  and changes in government regulations could adversely impact titan s revenues  operating expenses and profitability 
titan s defense and commercial businesses must comply with and are affected by various government regulations that impact titan s operating costs  profit margins and its internal organization and operation of its businesses 
these regulations affect how titan s customers and titan do business and  in some instances  impose added costs on titan s businesses 
any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect the financial performance of the business affected by the changed regulations 
with respect to us government contracts  any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination  price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting with the us government 
among the most significant regulations are the following the us federal acquisition regulations  which comprehensively regulate the formation  administration and performance of government contracts  the us truth in negotiations act  which requires certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with contract negotiations  and the us cost accounting standards  which impose accounting requirements that govern titan s right to reimbursement under certain cost based government contracts 
titan has taken an impairment charge in connection with surebeam corporation s indebtedness to titan  and titan may not be able to recover the estimated amounts from surebeam s bankruptcy and titan may be required to make net payments on lease and bank debt guarantees in excess of estimated amounts 
as a result of surebeam corporation s voluntary filing on january  for liquidation under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  titan recorded an estimated pre tax impairment charge of million in related to the million in principal owed to titan by surebeam under a senior secured credit facility  as well as obligations to reimburse titan under titan guarantees and subleases related to surebeam facilities 
the ultimate amount of impairment to be recognized is contingent upon the amount of actual proceeds recovered by titan from the liquidation of collateral securing the surebeam senior credit facility with titan  and titan s ability to mitigate its obligations under the facilities lease guarantees  through subleases  and loan repayments from hawaii pride 
the actual amount of titan s recovery from surebeam could be lower or higher than currently estimated 
titan is surebeam s only senior secured lender  however  other creditors of surebeam may seek to challenge titan s lien on some or all assets of surebeam in order to attempt to recover some of their claims 
titan also may be required to pay third parties more than it currently expects to pay under various guarantees and leases 
as of december   titan had guaranteed approximately million in future lease payments and had subleased surebeam facilities with estimated future lease payments of approximately million 
titan also had extended a partial guarantee of a bank loan to hawaii pride that had a balance of million as of december  titan may not be able to recoup the net book value of its discontinued commercial businesses  including titan wireless and titan technologies  through divestitures and may incur exit costs in excess of its accruals in connection with the divestiture or shut down of some or all of these businesses 
during  titan made the decision to exit substantially all of its remaining commercial businesses  including titan wireless and cayenta  and to focus in the foreseeable future on its national security and civil government businesses 
at december   the total net book value of its discontinued businesses is million  including million in titan wireless net assets  primarily relating to receivables on its contract with the opt of benin of million and a receivable from a customer in nigeria for million  and remaining accrued exit costs and other liabilities of approximately million  and remaining net assets of million in titan technologies 
if titan is unable to collect the remaining amounts due from the opt  it may incur additional impairment charges 
in relation to the remaining commercial information technology business of titan technologies currently held for sale 
if titan is unable to sell this business  it may be required to incur additional impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of this business and may incur additional operating losses 
titan s failure to identify  attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect its existing businesses 
titan cannot guarantee that it will be able to attract and retain the highly qualified technical personnel  including engineers  computer programmers and personnel with security clearances required for classified work  or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing titan s existing businesses 
titan competes primarily for government contracts against many companies that are larger  better financed and better known than titan 
if titan is unable to compete effectively  titan s business and prospects will be adversely affected 
titan s businesses operate in highly competitive markets 
many of its competitors are larger  better financed and better known companies who may compete more effectively than titan can 
in order to remain competitive  titan must invest to keep its products and services capabilities technically advanced and compete on price and on value added to titan s customers 
titan s ability to compete may be adversely affected by limits on titan s capital resources and titan s ability to invest in maintaining and expanding its market share 
titan has completed numerous strategic acquisitions which could increase titan s costs or liabilities or be disruptive 
since january   titan has acquired government information technology businesses as part of titan s strategy of consolidating government information technology businesses 
several of the businesses that titan acquired had themselves acquired other businesses prior to their acquisition by titan 
titan may not be able to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
the acquisition and integration of new businesses involves risk 
the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may result in a decrease in the value of titan s common stock for the following reasons  among others titan may need to divert more management resources to integration than titan planned  which may adversely affect titan s ability to pursue other more profitable activities  the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures  titan may not eliminate as many redundant costs as titan anticipated in selecting its acquisition candidates  and one or more of titan s acquisition candidates also may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that titan failed to discover through its due diligence prior to the acquisition 
titan may incur significant costs in protecting titan s intellectual property which could adversely affect titan s profit margins 
titan s inability to protect its patents and proprietary rights in the us and foreign countries could adversely affect titan s businesses prospects and competitive positions 
as part of titan s strategy  titan seeks to protect its proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary right protection in the us and other countries 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if titan is unable to obtain or maintain these protections  titan may not be able to prevent third parties from using its proprietary rights 
in addition  titan may incur significant expense both in protecting its intellectual property and in defending or assessing claims with respect to intellectual property owned by others 
titan assesses the strength of its patent and intellectual property protection for its technologies and products 
despite titan s assessments and titan s belief in the strength of its patent protection for particular technologies or products  titan s patents may not provide effective barriers to entry against competitors in the markets targeted by particular technologies and products because titan s competitors may develop competing technologies and products that do not infringe upon titan s patents 
titan also could choose to modify or abandon one or more planned or current products because of these assessments or actual or threatened claims by other companies 
titan is not certain that its pending patent applications will be issued 
titan also relies on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive 
titan has taken measures to protect its trade secrets and know how  including the use of confidentiality agreements with titan s employees  consultants and advisors 
it is possible that these agreements may be breached and that any remedies for a breach will not be sufficient to compensate titan for damages incurred 
titan generally controls and limits access to  and the distribution of  its product documentation and other proprietary information 
titan also cannot guarantee that other parties will not independently develop titan s know how or otherwise obtain access to titan s technology 
the covenants in titan s credit facility restrict titan s financial and operational flexibility  including its ability to complete additional acquisitions  invest in new business opportunities  or pay down certain indebtedness 
titan s credit facility contains covenants that restrict  among other things  titan s ability to borrow money  make particular types of investments  including investments in titan s subsidiaries  make other restricted payments  limits the ability to pay down the senior subordinated debt  swap or sell assets  merge or consolidate  or make acquisitions 
an event of default under titan s credit facility could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
titan has pledged substantially all of its consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries to secure the debt under titan s credit facility  excluding titan s foreign affiliates 
if the amounts outstanding under the credit facility were accelerated  the lenders could proceed against those consolidated assets and the stock of titan s subsidiaries 
any event of default  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s credit facility also requires titan to maintain specified financial ratios 
titan s ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond titan s control  and titan cannot assure you that titan will meet those ratios 
titan also may incur future debt obligations that might subject titan to restrictive covenants that could affect titan s financial and operational flexibility or subject titan to other events of default 
in addition  if the proposed merger with lockheed martin is not completed  we will remain subject to restrictive covenants in our senior subordinated notes 
these covenants may limit our flexibility to pursue all of our strategic objectives and could adversely affect our future operations 
titan s revenues could be less than expected if titan is not able to deliver components of systems or products as scheduled due to disruptions in its supply of products and components or services 
because titan s internal manufacturing capacity is limited  titan uses contract manufacturers 
while titan uses care in selecting its manufacturers  this arrangement gives titan less control over the reliability of supply  quality and price of products or components than if titan manufactured them itself 
in some cases  titan obtains products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
consequently  titan risks disruptions in its supply of key products and components if titan s suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of strikes  natural disasters  financial condition or other factors 
any material supply disruptions could adversely affect titan s ability to perform its obligations under its contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders  delays in realizing revenues  and payment delays as well as adversely affect titan s ongoing product cost structure 
titan s business is subject to significant environmental regulation 
compliance costs  or any future violations or liability under environmental laws  could harm titan s business 
titan is subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing the use  storage and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes and imposing liability for the cleanup of contamination from these substances 
titan cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these substances or wastes  and  in the event of such an incident  titan could be held liable for any damages that result 
from time to time  titan has been notified of violations of government and environmental regulations 
titan attempts to correct these violations promptly without any material impact on titan s operations 
in addition  titan may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations in the future 
these costs  and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on titan s business 
titan s results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  which could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
titan s revenues are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of sales and contracts awards due to the long procurement process for most of its products and services  the potential fluctuation of defense  intelligence and civil agency budgets  the time it takes for the new markets titan targets to develop and for titan to develop and provide products and services for those markets  competition and general economic conditions 
titan s contract type product mix and unit volume  its ability to keep expenses within budgets  and its pricing affect its gross margins 
these factors and other risk factors described herein may adversely affect titan s results of operations within a period and cause titan s financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
consequently  titan does not believe that comparison of its results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of its likely future results of operations 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters titan s operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if so  the market price of titan s common stock may decline significantly 
anti takeover provisions in titan s certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law  as well as titan s shareholder rights plan  could discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that titan s stockholders may favor 
provisions in titan s certificate of incorporation  titan s bylaws and delaware law could make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt that titan opposes even if a change in control of titan would be beneficial to the interests of its stockholders 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of titan s common stock 
these provisions permit titan s stockholders to take action by written consent instead of at a meeting and to nominate directors or bring other business before stockholder meetings only if they comply with advance notice and other procedural requirements in titan s bylaws  authorize titan s board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue up to  shares of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by titan s board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and prevent a takeover attempt  and prohibit titan from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own or more of titan s voting stock  or with their affiliates  unless titan s directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner 
in addition to the provisions described above  in titan s board of directors adopted a poison pill shareholder rights plan  which may further discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire titan which titan has not solicited or does not approve  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to titan s stockholders 
as a result  titan s stockholders who wish to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
under titan s rights plan  preferred share purchase rights  which are attached to titan s common stock  generally will be triggered upon the acquisition  or actions that would result in the acquisition  of or more of titan s common stock by any person or group 
if triggered  these rights would entitle titan s stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase  for the exercise price  shares of titan s common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price 
in addition  if a company acquires titan in a merger or other business combination not approved by the board of directors  these rights will entitle titan s stockholders other than the acquiror to purchase  for the exercise price  shares of the common stock of the acquiring company having a market value of two times the exercise price 
there may be volatility in the price of titan s common stock that impacts the price a stockholder may realize upon a sale of the common stock 
stock prices of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
the market price of titan s common stock may vary widely as a result of several factors  including status of the pending merger with lockheed martin  united states government s information technology  defense and civil budgets and strategic priorities  budgetary constraints affecting us government spending generally  changes in fiscal policy  and government regulatory initiatives  announcements of technological innovations or new products by titan or its competitors  patent or proprietary rights developments  and general market conditions 
these factors could lead to a significant decrease in the market price of titan s common stock 
in  the market price of titan s common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objectives of our asset liability management activities are to minimize debt and maximize net investment income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and facilitating our funding needs 
our net investment income and interest expense are subject to the risk of interest rate fluctuations
