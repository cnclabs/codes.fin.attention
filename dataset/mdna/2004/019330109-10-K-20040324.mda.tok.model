business and strategy overview during  management significantly changed the structure and strategy of the company 
the company had historically operated in two business segments under the name hathaway corporation motion control and power and process 
during  the company sold substantially all its power and process business segment and transformed the company to a focused motion company under the name allied motion technologies inc during and  the company has made considerable progress in implementing its new corporate strategy  the driving force of which is applied motion technology know how  and in the transformation of allied motion into a growth oriented motion company 
to ensure the implementation of all of our critical issues that are necessary to accomplish our overall strategy  we launched a formal process  called strategy deployment  in each allied motion operation 
the strategy deployment process includes the development of action plans and a rigorous and regular implementation review process to ensure we achieve the objectives of our strategic plan 
during  the company initiated recruitment efforts for various engineering and sales and marketing positions to enhance its ability to increase sales in the future 
the overhead cost reductions and the parallel recruitment efforts are consistent with improving our areas of excellence and the redeployment of resources in support of our strategy as an applied motion technology know how company 
key resources have been added in electrical design  mechanical design and in applied marketing and it is our belief these key resources will allow us to accelerate our current product re design as well as our new product development efforts 
we fully expect our recruiting efforts to result in cost effective and innovative new designs and solutions that will provide us with the technology platform to obtain a leadership position in our served market segments 
also during the company began the re alignment of its sales team to focus on selected vertical target market segments 
already  this has resulted in a much better understanding of these markets and through the emphasis on our applications expertise we will now be aligned to provide improved support for our customers in the future which we believe should contribute to the company s growth in sales and profitability 
during on a pro forma basis for the year including motor products for twelve months of  sales increased by approximately million and operating profits increased approximately million 
to accomplish this we utilized what we call a soft implementation of various processes available to our business units through our ever evolving and expanding set of tools 
this tool kit contains a well defined set of processes  training programs and procedures that are fundamental to the way we operate our businesses 
we have coined the term ast  for allied s systematic tools 
based on lean and six sigma principles  we provide our employees with well defined methods to addresses various assessment  development  execution and process needs within the company 
these tools include strategy development  strategy deployment  applied marketing  value stream mapping  cellular manufacturing  smed  six sigma  etc 
the soft implementation used during the past year will move to a more vigorous and scheduled implementation in each of our business units in we believe this will allow us to improve profitability of our existing operations as well as effectively integrate new acquisitions 
one of our major challenges  and a risk to our business  is to maintain and improve our price competitiveness 
our customers are continually being challenged by their markets and competitors to be price competitive and they are requiring their suppliers to deliver the highest quality product at the lowest price possible 
for the company to continue to be competitive in its markets  we must have the ability to continuously improve our cost of doing business while maintaining and improving the quality and performance of our products 
to accomplish this  we have placed significant emphasis on reducing our costs through the implementation of ast  re designing products and designing new products for cost improvement and manufacturing efficiency  sourcing materials and components from global low cost sources and establishing manufacturing capabilities in low cost regions 
the continuous improvement in our cost of doing business is an integral part of our corporate strategy 
subsequent acquisition on february   the company signed a merger agreement to acquire owosso corporation located in watertown  new york 
the closing of the merger is scheduled for the second quarter of owosso s sole operating subsidiary  stature electric  manufactures fractional and integral horsepower motors  gear motors  and motor part sets 
significant markets for stature include commercial products and equipment  healthcare  recreation and non automotive transportation 
stature s component products are sold throughout north america and in europe  primarily to original equipment manufacturers that use them in their end products 
stature electric excels at engineering  designing  packaging and applying integrated gearing and motor solutions for the commercial and industrial equipment  healthcare  recreation and non automotive transportation markets 
we utilized the framework of our strategy to ensure stature electric and allied motion were strategically aligned 
the markets they serve and the technology they bring are both extensions of and expansions to our current company know how 
the consideration for the merger of million will consist of the issuance of approximately  shares of allied motion common stock representing approximately of the outstanding shares of the company after the merger  million of cash payable to owosso s preferred shareholders  assumption of million of owosso s debt and approximately million of cash to settle the remainder of owosso s debt and liabilities at closing 
additional subordinated notes for up to  may be issued by allied motion effective january  payable over five years if stature achieves certain revenue levels in in addition  warrants to purchase  shares of allied motion common stock at per share will be issued to owosso s preferred shareholders

in addition to the acquisition of owosso and stature electric  the company continues to be in active discussions with other companies in pursuing strategic acquisitions to both provide external growth and to strengthen its technology base 
outlook the following will provide a good snapshot of what allied motion will focus its plans on in we will emphasize top line growth 
armed with our expanded areas of excellence we will launch innovative new products to our served markets and provide better service to our customers through our re aligned sales team and market segment specialists 
we will remain loyal to our strategy and will be relentless in our efforts to continue cost reductions internally  utilizing ast  allied s systematic tools  and externally through our expanded strategic sourcing activities with an increased emphasis on low cost region suppliers 
we will continue to focus on strengthening our management team and hire top notch personnel to satisfy our critical resource requirements in our areas of excellence applications and design engineering and applied marketing

price levels and the impact of inflation prices of the company s products have not increased significantly as a result of inflation during the past several years  primarily due to competition 
the effect of inflation on the company s costs of production has been minimized through production efficiencies and lower costs of materials 
the company anticipates that these factors will continue to minimize the effects of any foreseeable inflation and other price pressures from the industries in which it operates 
as the company s manufacturing activities mainly utilize semi skilled labor  which is relatively plentiful in the areas surrounding the company s production facilities  the company does not anticipate substantial inflation related increases in the wages of the majority of its employees 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on informed judgments and estimates of management 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties which affect the application of such policies 
the company uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates 
as discussed below the company s financial position or results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the company s critical accounting policies include the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based on historical experience and judgments based on current economic and customer specific factors 
significant judgments are made by management in connection with establishing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  the company s customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
the company continues to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which may not be collected 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of the company s customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company monitors and forecasts expected inventory needs based on sales forecasts 
inventory is written down or written off when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
these determinations involve the exercise of significant judgment by management 
if actual market conditions are significantly different than those projected by management the recorded reserve may be adjusted  and such adjustments may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly  and in the past we have recorded substantial charges for inventory obsolescence the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate tax jurisdiction in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
under previous standards  the assets had to be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use would recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows were less than their carrying value  even by one dollar  the long lived assets had to be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment was and is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
effective july   the company adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
provides a more restrictive fair value test to evaluate goodwill and long lived asset impairment 
depending upon future assessments of fair value  there could be impairment recorded related to goodwill and other long lived assets 
contractual commitments for more information on the company s contractual obligations on operating leases and contractual commitments  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company s commitments under these obligations were as follows in thousands year ended december  operating leases capital leases line of credit term loan litigation settlement total thereafter   the capital lease commitments include amounts representing interest 
the line of credit agreement matures on june  but can be extended upon agreement by silicon 
the term loan matures the earlier of february  or the date the line of credit terminates which is currently june assuming the company s line of credit will be renewed annually  the required principal payments would be  in   in and  in this allows for the term loan to be repaid over a forty two month period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
the company is exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to its normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   the company has not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s line of credit is variable based on the prime rate  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates
