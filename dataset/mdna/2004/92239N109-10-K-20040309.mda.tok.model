item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report  which are deemed to be incorporated into this section 
overview vastera is the worldwide leader in solutions for global trade management 
we are an international company with a presence in countries  serving an international client base that utilizes our solutions to manage trade worldwide 
our solutions have been designed to enable our clients to manage efficiently and effectively the information flows associated with the cross border movement of goods and comply with the myriad rules and regulations to which global trade is subject 
our solutions facilitate our clients abilities to manage the complexities and inefficiencies inherent in global trading in a manner that allows them to capitalize on the large  highly fragmented  and rapidly growing opportunity existing in the international market 
we have three major product and services offerings  which are tradesphere solutions  trade management consulting  and managed services 
the foundation upon which our product and services offerings are based is our collection of proprietary processes  data  rules  and regulations  which we call our global trade content 
global trade content is our proprietary rules based application that provides comprehensive management of trade regulations and programs and functions as the information repository for our entire suite of global trade management solutions 
tradesphere solutions is our suite of software solutions that helps manage critical trade processes  and provides visibility into shipment and carrier performance 
trade management consulting is our consulting services offering that applies our global trade expertise and our proprietary methodologies 
our consulting services range from performing opportunity and compliance assessments to implementing detailed strategic analyses designed to improve a client s global trade practices 
managed services is our business process outsourcing offering through which we combine our global trade content  trade expertise  and technology to improve client regulatory compliance and reduce transaction processing costs 
we offer managed services to address all or a portion of a client s global trade operations  ranging from one or more specific global trade functions to providing a complete suite of managed services 
the potential market into which we offer our products and services is an expansive one 
our product and services offerings  however  are new to their targeted audience 
while our offerings are critical to a company s remaining compliant with import and export rules and regulations  generally our offerings are not core to the business needs of a company 
this can often mean that the decision as to whether to purchase one of our solutions is predicated more on expected cost savings to be achieved by an entity than it is upon enhanced compliance 
in and  our sales cycle averaged approximately six to nine months for software sales and nine to months for managed services sales 
in  however  we have experienced a lengthening of these cycle times 
during  we experienced a significant slowing in the rate of growth of our revenues 
this slowing in growth rates reflects the impact of extended average sales cycle coupled with sales of managed services and software at lower than expected levels 
total revenues during demonstrated only modest growth  especially when compared to the revenue growth rates we experienced in and total sales of managed services and software for were lower than planned and considerably lower than what we achieved in the prior three years 
we expect that our revenues will remain at or below our revenue level until such time as we can accelerate the rate of our sales growth 
in  we implemented several expense reduction activities to help offset the lack of aggregate revenue growth and achieve profitability targets 
we expected that these cost reduction actions would be short in duration 
moreover  we expected to return to normalized spending levels once new sales reached established targets 
we did not  however  achieve our anticipated sales and  accordingly  the desired outcome was not achieved 
the expense reduction actions taken in have slowed our progress in sales and marketing  product development and managed services operations 
to satisfy customer expectations for product quality better  to serve our managed services customers better  and to re invest in sales and marketing  and re invigorate our revenue growth  we intend to increase spending on operating expenses by million to million in additionally  we anticipate spending more on our managed services operations in than we did in  which will result in a reduction in managed services gross margins during the foreseeable future and a reduction in our cash generated from operations due to continued net losses 
for the foreseeable future  we expect costs of managed services as a percentage of managed services revenues to increase as we make investments in personnel to expand our managed services platform  and continue our geographic expansion 
over the longer term  we expect to realize productivity improvements from our investment in our infrastructure 
as we enter into large multi year managed services agreements in new industry sectors or new geographic regions that may require significant investments in the related infrastructure  the costs associated with these managed services agreements are greater in the initial year than in the later years when we realize productivity improvements from these infrastructure investments 
our new management team is currently reviewing the level of investment we make in each of our product and services lines of business and geographic areas of presence 
we expect to streamline our product and services lines and to consolidate and reorganize our geographic locations 
to do so  we anticipate incurring costs associated with exiting contractual relationships and terminating personnel 
although management does not currently believe such costs will be material  we cannot yet quantify them or the effects these actions may have on future revenues 
critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  internal use software  and goodwill and intangible assets to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we cannot be certain that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
source of revenues and revenue recognition policy managed services revenues managed services revenues are derived from agreements that provide for transaction or services fees based on the performance and delivery of our managed services solutions 
managed services solutions include the processing of our clients customs and shipment entries and the classifying of clients goods 
managed services transaction arrangements are often subject to annual or quarterly minimum transaction thresholds and revenues are recognized based on the lower of the cumulative actual transactions processed using a weighted average transaction rate or the cumulative amount billable 
for those managed services transaction arrangements subject to annual minimums and for those arrangements where the amount billable for interim periods is limited to the pro rata portion of the annual minimum  transactions processed in excess of the minimum in each period are not billable  and  therefore  revenue is not recognized until the end of the related year 
certain managed services arrangements are based upon a fixed services fee 
revenues associated with these arrangements are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and limited to the amounts billable 
in addition  we may receive annual gainsharing fees under certain managed services arrangements based on a percentage of the client s annual cost savings  as defined in those managed services arrangements 
these gainsharing fees are recognized when they become fixed and determinable 
managed services transaction minimums and fixed service fees are typically billed monthly 
software revenues software revenues consist of term license revenues  perpetual software license revenues  and transaction based revenues 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software products in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
term license revenues are derived from term software license arrangements in which our clients license our software products and obtain the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis  ongoing support and content update services 
content updates are significant and frequent 
revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term 
term license arrangements typically range from three to five years 
to the extent we host the software for our customers  the hosting fee is recognized ratably over the contract period in conjunction with the recognition of the license fee 
term license fees are typically billed annually  quarterly or monthly 
perpetual software license revenues are derived from perpetual software license arrangements and related maintenance contracts 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified enhancements on a when and if available basis  ongoing support  and content update services 
the content updates provided under maintenance arrangements are significant and frequent  and  as a result  revenues from perpetual software license sales are recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the product 
we have estimated that the life of the product is three years  which is consistent with the historical periods between major upgrades to the functionality and architecture of our products 
accordingly  we experience a drop off in software revenues related to perpetual licenses at the end of the three year amortization period 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term  typically one year 
to the extent we host the software for our customers  the hosting fee is recognized ratably over the contract period in conjunction with the recognition of the license fee 
transaction based revenues are derived from agreements that provide for transaction fees based on a client s usage of our software products 
revenues from the usage of our software products are recognized as transactions occur 
we recognize revenues from arrangements with resellers beginning when the software product is sold to the end user 
any annual transaction minimums not sold by the reseller to the end customers are recognized as revenues upon the expiration of the annual minimum period 
services revenues services revenues are derived from implementation  trade management consulting and training services 
services are performed on a time and materials basis or under fixed price arrangements 
revenues on time and materials contracts are recognized based on fixed billable rates for hours delivered  and revenues on fixed priced contracts are recognized as the services are performed  using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred 
losses on arrangements are recognized when known 
for multiple element arrangements where we provide both software and software related services  we defer the service fee  based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  and recognize it as the services are performed 
internal use software in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize costs associated with the implementation and integration of our trade management platform to our managed services operations  related to certain capitalizable tasks including the technical design  system configuration and testing phases of the integration process 
judgment is involved in determining which development tasks associated with the platform integration are capitalizable pursuant to sop these costs are amortized as costs of managed services revenues over three years  and amortization commences upon the completion of the integration to the vastera platform 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we prepare an annual assessment to test for impairment of goodwill 
our assessment date is december st of each year 
the assessment requires us to compare the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair values 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we are required to compare the implied fair value  as defined  of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment 
the fair value and the implied fair value  as defined  is determined for the reporting units taking into consideration many factors  such as current performance  future projections  and market conditions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment for or disposal of long lived assets  purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset takes into consideration many factors  such as current performance  future projections  and market conditions 
relationship with ford motor company in august we acquired ford motor company s global customs operations and merged ford s global customs import operations into our managed services operations 
the ford import operations that were merged into us consisted of ford personnel and technology utilized by ford to manage its international trade transactions 
by combining our existing technology and intellectual capital with that acquired from ford  we have expanded our managed services offerings to companies of varying sizes on a global basis 
ford received  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million at the time of the transaction 
as of december   ford owned approximately of our common stock 
at the time we acquired ford s customs import operations  we also entered into a global trade management services agreement  under which vastera manages ford s global trade import operations in the us subsequent to signing the global trade management services agreement  we expanded our relationship with ford by assuming responsibility for administering and managing its global trade import operations in mexico  canada  the united kingdom  spain  belgium  and germany the united kingdom  spain  belgium  and germany ford entities collectively referred to as ford europe 
as initially structured  we billed ford in the us on a per transaction basis 
the agreements signed with ford in each of these geographic areas provide us with guaranteed  predictable and recurring revenue streams at least through december  ford originally guaranteed us an annual minimum number of transactions  with all transactions processed in excess of the guaranteed minimum being charged to ford in the fourth quarter of each year 
by requiring that ford guarantee an annual minimum number of transactions  we were able to create a certain level of predictability in our revenue stream 
in february  we amended our agreement with ford us to provide for quarterly minimum transaction levels in lieu of annual minimum transaction levels 
by amending the agreement in this manner  we were able to bill ford on a quarterly basis for the transactions processed in excess of the minimum levels 
in connection with the amendment  we agreed to reduce ford s us aggregate annual minimum revenue guarantee from million to million 
for the three months and six months ended june   we derived approximately million and million  respectively  in revenues related to transactions in excess of the quarterly minimum 
in july  we amended our agreement to eliminate the variability associated with the original billing practice and to provide that we bill ford us a fixed annual service fee of million for the remaining life of the agreement  irrespective of the number of transactions we process 
we expect to derive no less than million in revenues from our agreements with ford us  ford mexico  ford canada  and ford europe on an annual basis 
we believe our client relationship with ford will have a significant impact on our total revenues  and ford is expected to account for greater than of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
in   and  ford motor company accounted for   and of our total revenues  respectively 
as of december  and  ford owed us approximately million and million  or and  of our total accounts receivable  respectively 
we reimburse ford for certain of its expenses associated with our use of ford s facilities  the costs of leased employees  and maintenance and expenses related to the acquired technology 
during  we expect to pay approximately  in fees to ford each month for reimbursement of these expenses 
in   and  we paid ford approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
these payments increased beginning in december  when we assumed responsibility for managing ford s import operations in europe 
however  we expect payments to decrease in the future as we leverage our existing facilities and employees and deploy our own technology 
lucent in august  we entered into a five year agreement with lucent technologies to manage lucent s global trade operations in the united states 
from august through august  we expect to generate approximately million in aggregate revenues from our agreement with lucent us subsequently  we expanded our relationship with lucent by assuming responsibility for administering and managing lucent s global trade operations in other countries in north america  europe and in brazil 
in and  lucent accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
as of december  and  lucent owed us approximately million and million  or and  of our total accounts receivable  respectively 
in august  lucent will be able to terminate the agreement for convenience with six months notice 
we anticipate negotiating an extension to the agreement 
acquisitions on june   we acquired ge s internal us customs import operations 
we also entered into a managed services agreement under which vastera will manage the us customs import operations for five of ge s us divisions for a minimum term of three years 
the results of ge s internal us customs import operations have been included in our operations since july   the effective date of the acquisition 
in exchange for its internal us customs import operations  ge received million in cash and  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  the purchase price  including transaction costs of approximately  totaled approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we executed on our strategy of expanding our global presence to enhance our competitive position worldwide and our ability to serve and support our clients 
as part of this strategy  we acquired companies in mexico  canada  and brazil for combined purchase prices of approximately million 
on march   we acquired speedchain  a development stage company with no revenues since its inception in  for approximately million 
speedchain is a supply chain event management and global e logistics solutions provider 
the acquisition was effected through the merger of speedchain into one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  vastera acquisition corporation 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities and identified intangibles were accounted for as goodwill 
we recorded an aggregate of approximately million and million of identified intangibles and goodwill  respectively  in in connection with the acquisitions executed in mexico  canada  and brazil in the first quarter of we recorded approximately million of goodwill including amounts reclassified from assembled workforce to goodwill in connection with the speedchain acquisition 
we recorded approximately million and million of identified intangibles and goodwill including amounts reclassified from assembled workforce to goodwill  respectively  in in connection with our acquisition of ford s global customs import operations 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over one to five years  resulting in charges to operations of million in on january   in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we reclassified our assembled workforce intangible assets to goodwill 
as of january   we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million 
on january   we adopted the nonamortization approach under sfas no 
for our goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets in   and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in december  we recorded a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets associated with our prior acquisitions 
the impairment resulted from our annual review of goodwill and intangible assets  which considered current business performance  slowed growth and other market conditions 
sfas no 
requires us to perform annual testing to compared each reporting unit fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assess the fair value of each of our reporting units and their intangible assets as of december  and we determined that each reporting units carrying value  including goodwill  did not exceed its fair value as of december  as of december   we determined that two of our reporting units carrying values  including goodwill  exceeded their respective fair values 
as a result  at december   we assessed the fair value of the reporting units assets  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities and derived an implied fair value for the each reporting units goodwill 
since the carrying amount of goodwill was greater than its implied fair value for the two identified reporting units  we recognized a charge of million charge for impairment of goodwill in december we determined fair value of the reporting units using an average of the income approach and market approach values 
we determined the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities using our estimate of discounted cash flows 
we used a discount rate based on the specific risks and circumstances associated with the identified intangible asset or other non goodwill assets or liability being evaluated 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows for identified intangible assets and other non goodwill assets and liabilities  including the discount rate  reflect our estimates 
the discount rate was based upon our weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the risks associated with the operations being tested 
as part of the review of our financial results for  we performed an assessment of the carrying value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  as required by sfas no 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million in december  related to the impairment of technology and know how acquired in our prior acquisitions 
this charge was based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the developed technology exceeded its fair value 
fair value was determined based on our estimate of the discounted future cash flows derived from the developed technology  which had separately identifiable cash flows 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows  including the discount rate  reflect our estimates 
the discount rate was based upon our weighted average cost of capital  as adjusted for the risks associated with the operations being tested 
management s disclosure of non gaap financial measures from time to time  management makes public disclosures  other than in our sec filings on form q or form k  of certain financial measures such as pro forma earnings loss and ebitda  as adjusted as defined below  that are not considered gaap financial measures 
on january   we issued an earnings press release and included it as an exhibit to a form k we filed with the sec the same day 
this press release contained reconciliations of pro forma earnings loss and ebitda  as adjusted  to our reported net loss 
management believes that pro forma earnings loss is a useful supplement to gaap financial measures as it measures our operating performance and liquidity for the reporting period because it excludes those charges associated with past events that are not related to current operations or that are not relevant to current operations and will not be in the foreseeable future 
because the company has such a significant balance of net operating losses that it will be able to carry forward and apply against future us tax liabilities  we exclude income taxes from the calculation of pro forma earnings loss 
although we do pay income taxes on a portion of the revenues we generate  the aggregate amount of such payments is not material in relation to our net operating losses 
until such time as we generate income from operations and have fully applied our net operating losses to future tax liabilities  which we do not expect to occur during the foreseeable future  we believe that income taxes will not be a relevant element of our operating performance 
the excluded intangible amortization expense and impairment of goodwill and intangibles are associated with identifiable intangible assets from prior acquisitions 
the excluded stock based compensation expense pertains to deferred non cash compensation charges recorded in connection with our initial public offering of common stock and from prior acquisitions 
ebitda  as adjusted  excludes expenses related to amortization of intangible assets  restructuring charges  impairment of goodwill and intangibles  stock based compensation  income taxes  depreciation  amortization of revenue discounts related to customer contracts and amortization of capitalized internal use software costs  and other income  net 
management uses ebitda  as adjusted  to measure and evaluate our operating performance and liquidity  because it reflects the resources available from the reporting period s operations for operating and strategic opportunities 
these opportunities include investing in the business  meeting financing obligations  making strategic acquisitions  and paying other cash obligations 
therefore  management believes ebitda  as adjusted  is an appropriate measure by which to evaluate our operating performance and liquidity 
pro forma earning loss and ebitda  however  should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or as being superior to  operating net losses  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  future expected of total revenues amount percent of total amount percent of total increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands managed services    software    services   total revenues    we expect total revenues for to be between million and million 
managed services revenues 
we derive managed services revenues from agreements that provide for transaction or service fees based on our performance of managed services 
the increase in managed services revenues from to primarily resulted from the following higher revenue from our new contract with ge  which began on july  higher revenue  from the inclusion of a full year of revenue associated with our contract with ford europe  which began in december additional revenue from other new managed services contracts signed in a reduction in revenue of approximately million related to excess transactions billed to ford us in but for which no excess transactions were billed during a reduction in revenue from the effect of a few contract transaction minimum step downs in because  in some of our transaction based managed service contracts  the minimum number of guaranteed transactions declines over time 
to the extent the minimum volumes step down over time and the customer transaction volumes are below the minimum  our revenues decrease over that time period 
our top five managed services customers accounted for of our managed services revenues in both and our non us managed services revenues increased to million in from approximately million in the majority of this increase resulted from expansion of our customer contracts into europe 
the favorable effect on revenues of changes in exchange rates between and was approximately 
we expect non us managed services revenues to continue to increase as a percentage of managed services revenues in the future 
in  we expect revenues on several of our customer contracts to decrease due to reductions in the base minimum fees associated with the step down in the minimum number of transactions in those contracts 
we estimate between approximately million and million of reduced revenues from these contracts in additionally  revenue derived from large customer contracts may change as we renew these contracts 
if we fail to maintain or expand the scope of services provided under these contracts  our revenues from these contracts will decrease 
software revenues 
software revenues consist of term license revenues  perpetual software license revenues  maintenance revenues  and transaction based revenues 
the revenue decrease in from resulted from the drop off of revenue from perpetual licenses sold in prior years  maintenance cancellations  and the conversion of several software customers to managed services 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in software revenues from new customers and expansion of arrangements with existing customers 
our top five software customers accounted for and of our total software revenues in and  respectively 
we expect software revenues to decrease because we do not expect new business to offset the expiration of million per year license fee from a japanese customer and the drop off of revenues from perpetual licenses 
services revenues 
we derive services revenues from performance of implementation of software for our customers  management consulting and training services 
our services revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on many factors  such as demand by our customers  the number of billable days in a quarter  utilization and the number of new software contracts executed in recent quarters 
historically  less than of our services revenues have been derived from implementation services performed in connection with new software license sales 
services revenues were nearly constant from to our five largest services customers accounted for and of our services revenues in and  respectively 
in  we expect services revenues to decrease slightly due to less expected project work with several customers 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  amount percent of segment revenues amount percent of segment revenues increase in thousands in thousands in thousands cost of revenues managed services    software   services   total cost of revenues    cost of managed services revenues 
cost of managed services revenues consist of salaries and related expenses for our managed services organization and amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to implementation and integration of our trade management platform to our managed services operation 
the cost increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of managed services revenues was largely due to our european expansion and several new contracts with lower profit margins than our earlier contracts 
these costs were partially offset by efficiencies we achieved in our us operations as we migrated from ford s technology systems to our own 
cost of software revenues 
cost of software revenues includes royalties owed to third parties for technology products integrated into our software products as well as the cost of salaries and related expenses for our software customer support organization 
the slight cost increase was largely due to our investment in our client support infrastructure 
the increase as a percentage of software revenues results from our additional investment in our client support infrastructure to support our new product offerings  as well as a reduction in our software revenues 
we expect the cost of software revenues as a percentage of software revenues to be relatively constant in the foreseeable future 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues includes the cost of salaries and related expenses for implementation  management consulting and training services provided to clients  as well as the cost of third parties we contract with to provide either implementation services or trade management consulting to our clients 
from quarter to quarter as customer demand fluctuates  the cost of services revenues will fluctuate based on actions we take to align our personnel capacity with demand  such as changes in our use of subcontractors  delays or accelerations of hiring personnel and the temporary deployment of resources to or from other business segments 
the slight change in cost of services revenues from to is consistent with the slight change in services revenues 
we expect the cost of services to fluctuate relative to services revenues in  but remain relatively consistent on a percentage of services revenues basis for the year 
operating expenses for the year ended december  amount percent of total revenues amount percent of total revenues increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    depreciation   sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  public relations  trade shows and travel expenses related to both promotional events and direct sales efforts 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs resulted primarily from cost actions we took  principally personnel reductions to reduce salaries  commissions  and travel costs 
we anticipate sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars in as discussed previously 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  and equipment for personnel who develop and support software for external sale and use in our managed services business 
the decrease in research and development costs also was primarily from cost actions we took  principally personnel reductions 
these actions included a reduction in personnel and the transfer of some of our research and development activities to locations with lower labor costs 
we anticipate research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in as discussed previously 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  and outside accounting  legal and insurance fees and related costs for executive  finance  legal  human resources  administrative and information services personnel 
the increase in these costs resulted from additional professional fees to manage our domestic affairs and international expansion  higher legal fees  and severance costs 
we anticipate general and administrative expense to remain relatively constant in depreciation 
the increase resulted from the depreciation of fixed assets we purchased to build the technology infrastructure needed to support growth of our business 
most of these new assets were related to build out our data center 
we expect our depreciation expense to increase in absolute dollars in as we continue to invest in our infrastructure 
for the year ended december  amount percent of total revenue amount percent of total revenue increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands intangible amortization expense   restructuring   impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation   intangible amortization expense 
the increase resulted from the effect of amortizing the identified intangible assets acquired in the three acquisitions completed in the first quarter of for a full year in  and the additional amortization from the identified intangible assets acquired from ge in the second quarter of these increases were offset slightly by a decrease in fluctuations in foreign currency rates and the related translations into us dollars 
as a result of the impairment charges we previously described  we expect amortization of intangibles in future periods to be approximately     and  for the years ending december      and  respectively 
restructuring 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during costs associated with the termination of approximately employees totaled approximately million 
costs associated with the closing of redundant facilities  the cancellation of certain contracts  and other non personnel related actions totaled approximately million 
we paid approximately   and  of restructuring costs in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and wrote off property and equipment of approximately  we reduced the restructuring reserve during the fourth quarter of by approximately  based on differences between actual costs incurred compared to our original estimates 
during the fourth quarter of  we negotiated a favorable buy out of the lease on one of our facilities we closed  which resulted in a benefit of  that we recorded on the restructuring line item 
as of december   the remaining restructuring reserve was approximately  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
during  we recorded a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets associated with our prior acquisitions 
the impairment reflects the results of our annual assessment of the value of goodwill and intangible asset  as previously discussed 
stock based compensation 
our stock based compensation resulted from options issued to employees prior to our initial public offering in with exercise prices less than fair value and from options issued to employees in connection with our acquisition of speedchain in we record stock based compensation on an accelerated basis and  accordingly  the expense was lower than the expense 
we expect to amortize the remaining deferred compensation of approximately  in the quarter ending march  other income expenses and income taxes for the year ended december  increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands other income expenses  net income taxes other income expenses  net 
other income expenses  net fluctuates based on the amount of cash balances available for investment  borrowings under our lines of credit  interest and other expenses related to our equipment borrowings  and realized gains and losses on investments 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from lower prevailing interest rates 
income taxes 
in  our income tax provision was comprised of federal  state  and foreign taxes 
in  the federal tax provision resulted from the limitation applied to net operating losses for alternative minimum tax purposes 
no provision for federal income taxes was recorded for  due to accumulated net operating losses 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of these future tax benefits 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating losses  which may be carried forward to offset future taxable income  subject to ownership change limitations 
as defined under the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership have occurred 
as a result  future utilization of these net operating carryforwards that we accumulated prior to the change in ownership are subject to annual limitations 
as of december   million of the net operating loss carryforwards were attributable to tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options and the remainder to operating activities 
federal net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset up to of our alternative minimum taxable income 
as of december   we had alternative minimum tax and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and million respectively 
as of december   we also had approximately million of foreign net operating losses  which may be carried forward to offset future taxable income 
the net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  amount percent of total amount percent of total increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands managed services    software    services   total revenues    managed services revenues 
we attribute the increase in managed services revenues to the continued growth in our automotive and high tech managed services client base and expansion of our responsibilities with existing customers  primarily with ford  lucent  and nortel 
software revenues 
the decrease in software revenues was due to million of nonrecurring revenue recognized in related to the expiration of a japanese customer s annual minimum period in connection with our reseller arrangement 
excluding the nonrecurring revenue recognized from this japanese customer in  total software revenue increased in by approximately million  or  from services revenues 
services revenue was relatively constant from to cost of revenues for the year ended december  amount percent of segment revenue amount percent of segment revenue increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands cost of revenues managed services    software   services   total cost of revenues    cost of managed services revenues 
the increase in cost of managed services revenues was largely due to the growth of our managed services operations to support our growing client base and our european expansion 
the increase as a percentage of managed services revenues reflects our additional personnel and infrastructure costs related to our european expansion 
over time  we expect to realize productivity improvements from our investment in our support infrastructure and the leveraging of personnel in the performance of our managed services agreements 
as we enter into large multi year managed services agreements in new industry sectors or new geographic regions that may require significant investments in the related infrastructure  the costs associated with these managed services agreements may be greater in the initial year than in the later years when we expect to realize productivity improvements from these infrastructure investments 
cost of software revenues 
the increase in cost of software revenues was largely due to our investment in our client support infrastructure 
the increase as a percentage of software revenues reflects our additional investment in our client support infrastructure and the effect of million of nonrecurring software revenue recognized in the third quarter of cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues was relatively constant from to operating expenses for the year ended december  amount percent of total revenue amount percent of total revenue increase decrease in thousands in thousands in thousands sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative   depreciation    sales and marketing

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we develop solutions in the united states and market them in north america  and to a lesser extent  in europe  latin america  and the asia pacific region 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
with most of our sales being generated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
amounts outstanding under our secured revolving line of credit arrangement exposes us to interest rate risk if the prime rate increases 
we had approximately million in variable rate debt as of december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material risk exposure 
we do not hold or issue derivative securities  derivative commodity instruments  or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
