item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are set forth in note of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are set forth on pages f a through f of these significant accounting policies  the company considers the policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be its most critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
in addition  changes in economic conditions can have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses and therefore the provision for loan losses and results of operations 
the company has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  recognizing that this pro cess requires a number of assumptions and estimates with respect to its loan portfolio 
the company s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers that is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
overview the primary business of bancorp is mortgage lending 
the markets in which bancorp operates  anne arundel county  maryland  as well as surrounding areas in maryland  northern virginia and delaware  have enjoyed strong real estate demand 
this has fueled bancorp s growth  along with the demand to refinance existing mortgages as a result of historically low interest rates 
refinancing activity began to slow down toward the end of the third quarter of  and slowed considerably in the fourth quarter of however  with interest rates remaining low  construction lending and purchase money mortgage lending have continued to be extremely active 
bancorp has been able to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and reduce its cost of liabilities 
interest rates paid on deposits have decreased significantly  as have interest rates paid for borrowing funds from the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the difference between bancorp s costs of funds and what it earns on mortgage loans is the interest rate spread 
this spread has increased as bancorp s growing portfolio of mortgage loans coupled with the fees earned on loans sold in the secondary market  has driven up overall revenues 
while variable expenses  such as compensation  have increased  bancorp s overall expenses have remained modest which has resulted in increasing profitability 
bancorp s asset quality has remained excellent  as there have been minimal losses due to defaulting loans 
going forward  bancorp s challenge will be to continue to grow assets in the form of mortgage loans  while earning a profitable spread  and continuing to maintain good asset quality 
interest rates are outside the control of bancorp  so it must attempt to balance its pricing and duration of its loan portfolio against the risks of rising costs of its deposits and borrowings 
the continued success and attraction of anne arundel county  maryland  and vicinity  will also be important to bancorp s ability to originate and grow its mortgage loans  as will bancorp s continued focus on maintaining a low overhead

fhlb advances 
fhlb advances were  at december  compared to  at december   which is an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the fact that rates paid on federal home loan bank advances were less expensive than what the bank was able to generate through retail deposits and the bank implemented a strategy to lock in interest rates for a longer term in the form of advances from the federal home loan bank for terms of three years and longer

bancorp s net income for the year ended december  was  or per share  diluted  compared to  or per share  diluted  for the year ended december  this increase of  or was primarily the result of increases in loan origination volume and the increase in interest income coupled with a reduction in the cost of deposits and other borrowings  as well as the maintenance of relatively low non interest expenses 
it is uncertain whether bancorp will be able to generate the volume of loan originations that it has done over the past two years as the trend  beginning in the third quarter of  was that refinances of mortgages were significantly slowing down 
however  loan originations  overall  remain strong  and provided the real estate market in the bank s primary lending areas rema in positive  the bank may continue with strong loan originations 
net interest income 
net interest income interest earned net of interest charges totaled  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   or an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the growth in the loan portfolio and the reduction on the interest on deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
the net interest margin increased to at december  from at december  the bank s net interest margin increased over the past year because interest rates paid on the bank s deposits have fallen faster than the interest rates earned on the bank s assets 
however  the increase in the net interest margin slowed from the increase between december  and december  and the bank does not expect that interest on its deposits and f ederal home loan bank advances will continue to drop as it has over the last two years 
the bank is uncertain whether it will be able to continue to attract low cost liabilities  as it has done in the last two years due to the general expectation of rising interest rates in the future and the recent flow of depositor funds into the stock market 
provision for loan losses 
bancorp s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk and an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
credit risk includes  but is not limited to  the potential for borrower default and the failure of collateral to be worth what bancorp determined it was worth at the time of the granting of the loan 
the bank monitors its loan portfolio at least as often as quarterly and its loan delinquencies at least as often as monthly

the bank s board  with the advice and recommendation of the bank s delinquency committee  estimates an allowance to be set aside for loan losses 
included in determining the calculation are such factors a s the inherent risk contained within the portfolio after considering the state of the general economy  economic trends  consideration of particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending and consideration of known information that may affect loan collectibility 
an increase in the loan loss provision from the beginning of the period to the end of a period would have come about after an analysis of the aforementioned factors and applying that rationale to the total portfolio 
the greater the construction  commercial and higher loan to value loans that are contained in the portfolio  the greater will be the allowance for loan losses 
changes in estimation methods may take place based upon the status of the economy and the estimate of the value of collateral and  as a result  the allowance may increase or decrease 
the bank believes that some portions of its loan portfolio have greater actual risk and  in other areas  there is greater inherent risk 
the loan loss allowance has increased when the board believes trends are negative and contributions to the allowance have decreased when trends are more positive 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
as of december   the total allowance for loan losses was  as compared to  as of december   which is an increase of  or 
the increase was a result of the current year s addition to the allowance and minimal charge offs being incurred 
during the year ended december   the provision for loan losses was  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was a result of management s determination that adding to the provision for loan losses was  more or less  appropriate for the level of inherent risk in its portfolio as compared to the year ended december  other income and non interest expense 
gain on sale of loans was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase of  or  was a result of an increasing volume of loan originations due to the continued low interest rate environment that resulted in the continuing refinance of residential mortgages 
however  beginning in the late third quarter of the refinance of residential mortgages began to decline significantly and the bank anticipates  but is not certain  that loan originations in the form of residential refinances are likely to decrease in the future 
if this happens  there is likely to be a reduction in the amount of gain on sale of loans which will also cause a reduction in mortgage processing fees 
compensation paid to loan officers for the originations of loans would also commensurately be reduced 
real estate commissions and real estate management fees for the year ended december  were  and  respectively  as compared to december  when real estate commissions and real estate management fees were  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources 
bancorp s liquidity is determined by its ability to raise funds through loan payments  maturing investments  deposits  borrowed funds  capital  or the sale of loans 
based on the internal and external sources available  bancorp s liquidity position exceeded anticipated short term and long term needs at december  core deposits  considered to be stable funding sources and defined to include all deposits except time deposits of  or more  equaled of total deposits at december  the bank s experience is that a substantial portion of certificates of deposit will renew at time of maturity and will remain on deposit with the bank 
additionally  loan payments  maturities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in addition to its ability to generate deposits  bancorp has external sources of funds which may be drawn upon  when desired 
the primary source of external liquidity is an available line of credit equal to of the bank s assets with the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the available line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta was  at december   of which  was outstanding at that time 
in assessing its liquidity the management of bancorp considers operating requirements  anticipated deposit flows  expected funding of loans  deposit maturities and borrowing availability  so that sufficient funds may be available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise so that bancorp may take advantage of business opportunities 
a further consideration relating to liquidity concerns the need for funds to construct the administrative headquarters building at westgate circle  the construction of which should begin in as of december  bancorp had  outstanding in loan commitments  which bancorp expects to fund from the sources of liquidity described above 
this amount does not include undisbursed lines of credit  home equity loans and standby letters of credit  in the aggregate amount of  which bancorp anticipates it will be able to fund  if required  from these liquidity sources in the regular course of busi ness 
in addition to the foregoing  the payment of dividends is a use of cash  but is not expected to have a material effect on liquidity 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
bancorp s net income for the year ended december  was  or per share  diluted  compared to  or per share  diluted  for the year ended december  the increase of  or was primarily the result of increases in loan origination volume and in the loan portfolio  as well as the increase in interest income  coupled with a reduction in the cost of deposits and other liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative information about market risk 
the principal objective of bancorp s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risks appropriate given bancorp s business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with bancorp s interest rate risk management policy 
through this management  bancorp seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors of bancorp is responsible for reviewing assets liability policies and interest rate risk position 
the board of directors reviews the interest rate risk position on a quarterly basis 
in connection with this review  the board of directors evaluates bancorp s business activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on bancorp s net interest margin and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on bancorp s loan portfolio 
continuous movement of interest rates is certain  however  the extent and timing of these movements is not always predictable 
any movement in interest rates has an effect on bancorp s profitability 
bancorp faces the risk that rising interest rates could cause the cost of interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  to rise faster than the yield on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments 
bancorp s interest rate spread and interest rate margin may be negatively impacted in a declining interest rate environment even though bancorp generally borrows at short term interest rates and lends at longer term interest rates 
this is because loans and other interest earning assets may be prepaid and replaced with lower yielding assets before the supporting interest bearing liabilities reprice downward 
bancorp s interest rate margin may also be negatively impacted in a flat or inverse yield curve environment 
mortgage origination activity tends to increase when interest rates trend lower and decrease when interest rates rise 
bancorp s primary strategy to control interest rate risk is to sell substantially all long term fixed rate loans in the secondary market 
to further control interest rate risk related to its loan servicing portfolio  bancorp originates a substantial amount of construction loans that typically have terms of one year or less 
the turnover in construction loan portfolio assists bancorp in maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk 
quantitative information about market risk 
the primary market risk facing bancorp is interest rate risk 
from an enterprise prospective  bancorp manages this risk by striving to balance its loan origination activities with the interest rate market 
bancorp attempts to maintain a substantial portion of its loan portfolio in short term loans such as construction loans 
this has proven to be an effective hedge against rapid increases in interest rates as the construction loan portfolio reprices rapidly 
the matching of maturity or repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the bank s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an interest earning asset or interest bearing liability is interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities represents the bank s interest sensitivity gap 
exposure to interest rate risk is actively monitored by bancorp s management 
its objective is to maintain a consistent level of profitability within acceptable risk tolerances across a board range of potential interest rate environments 
bancorp uses the ots net portfolio value npv model to monitor its exposure to interest rate risk  which calculates changes in npv 
the following table represents bancorp s npv at december  the npv was calculated by the ots  based upon information provided to the ots 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv net portfolio value npv as of pv of assets change in rates amount change change npv ratio change dollars are in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp risk measures for give rate shock pre shock npv ratio npv as of pv of assets post shock npv ratio sensitivity measure decline in npv ratio bp bp bp tb a level of risk minimal minimal minimal note calculations of using cmr data edited cmr report filing required 
for this quarter  the sensitivity measure is defined as the decline in the pre shock npv ratio caused by a basis point decrease of a basis point increase in interest rates  whichever produced the larger decline 
due to the abnormally low prevailing interest rate environment  this report no longer provides npv estimates for changes in interest rates of or basis points beginning with the march cycle  basis points beginning with the september cycle  and basis points beginning with the december cycle
