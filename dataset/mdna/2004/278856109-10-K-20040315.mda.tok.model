marketing and sales our marketing and sales teams target small  stand alone hospitals  large multi entity healthcare systems and academic medical centers 
we sell our products and services in north america exclusively through our direct sales force 
the management of our sales force is decentralized  with three senior vice presidents having primary responsibility for sales and marketing within three areas 
the areas  in turn  are broken down into a total of ten regions 
within each sales region  our sales force is organized into two separate groups 
the first is focused on generating sales to new customers 
the second is focused on additional sales to existing customers 
our direct sales force works closely with our implementation and product line specialists 
we also have a team of experts with extensive experience with each of our specific software applications that support our sales force 
our sales personnel are compensated principally on a performance basis 
research and development we believe that our future success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our product lines and in developing new products that appeal to our customers 
we seek to maintain technological competitiveness and respond to our customers expanding needs 
we are currently developing our software based on microsoft s 
net framework and other industry standards 
we are also creating new functionality for our existing software 
since the announcement of our sunrisexa response time issues in october  we have made significant changes within our research and development department 
among other things  we have decreased our reliance on outside vendors that have historically aided our internal personnel in developing our software 
in addition  we have hired a new chief technology officer who is principally responsible for our software development 
our chief technology officer has substantial experience in the development of commercial software 
to assist him  we have also hired new senior software engineers with substantial experience 
this team has adopted a new software development methodology  microsoft s solutions framework 
this new methodology allows us  among other things  to gauge the quality and performance of our software development efforts in hour increments 
we believe that these significant changes in our development organization will position us to deliver quality software that will meet or exceed our customers needs 
competition we face intense competition in the marketplace 
we are confronted by rapidly changing technology  evolving user needs and the frequent introduction of new products to meet the needs of our current and future customers 
our principal competitors include cerner corporation  epic systems corporation  ge medical systems  idx systems corporation  mckesson corporation  quadramed corporation and siemens ag 
other competitors include providers of practice management  general decision support and database systems  as well as segment specific applications and healthcare technology consultants 
several of our competitors are better established  benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly more financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we also anticipate that competition will further increase as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries 
the principal factors that impact competition within our market include product functionality  performance  flexibility and features  use of open industry standards  quality of customer service and support  company reputation  price and total cost of ownership 
employees as of december   we had  employees 
our success depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense in our industry  particularly for software developers  service consultants and sales and marketing personnel 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
our employees are not represented by any labor unions 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
financial information about geographic areas revenue from us operations totaled million in revenue from outside the united states totaled million in long lived assets totaled million in the united states in and million in other countries in certain factors that may affect future operating results there are a number of important factors that could affect our business and future operating results including  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
the information contained in this report should be read in light of such factors 
any of the following factors could harm our business and future operating results 
we face a number of risks relating to our recently announced strategy to address sunrisexa response time issues in october  we announced the existence of certain response time issues within some components of sunrisexa  the newest version of our sunrise family of products 
we concluded that the root cause of the issue was in the technical design of sunrisexa  which did not adequately support the throughput required in the highly interactive patient care environment 
after substantial analysis  we announced and are pursuing a strategy designed to address these issues 
our strategy is to replace the affected sunrisexa components with certain components from our scm product  which is our prior generation  core clinical product 
although we believe that we have made significant progress in implementing that strategy and proving its technological feasibility  we continue to face a variety of risks and uncertainties in this regard including the following we may encounter technical obstacles and delays in implementing this approach 
as we continue to implement our strategy  it is possible that we could discover additional problems with our software 
it is possible that the availability of sunrisexa release  or the releases of anticipated additional features for our products  may be delayed 
this could result in delayed or lost sales 
customers who are currently implementing sunrisexa have faced delays in their implementations 
as a result  existing sunrisexa customers could attempt to cancel their contracts with us or seek financial or other concessions from us 
as a result of the changes we will make to our sunrisexa product offering  potential customers may find such products less appealing  which could decrease demand for our products 
operating results for the year ended december  reflect a million write down of capitalized software development costs related to certain sunrisexa components and a warranty reserve of million related to the anticipated costs associated with the sunrisexa response time issue 
although we believe that this reserve is adequate to cover any potential losses  it is possible that we may discover additional facts that lead us to conclude that additional write offs or reserves may be required 
these issues could harm our relationships with customers generally and our reputation in the marketplace 
our product strategy is dependent on the continued development and support by microsoft of its 
net framework and other technologies our product strategy is substantially dependent upon microsoft s 
net framework and other microsoft technologies 
the 
net framework  in particular  is a relatively new and evolving technology 
if microsoft were to cease actively supporting 
net or other technologies  fail to update and enhance them to keep pace with changing industry standards  encounter technical difficulties in the continuing development of these technologies or make them unavailable to us  we could be required to invest significant resources in re engineering our products 
this could lead to lost or delayed sales  unanticipated development expenses and harm to our reputation  and would cause our financial results and business to suffer 
given the length of our sales and implementation cycles  if a significant number of our customers delay implementation  our future operating results may suffer we have experienced long sales and implementation cycles 
how and when to implement  replace  expand or substantially modify an information system  or modify or add business processes  are major decisions for hospitals  our target market 
furthermore  our software is expensive and generally requires significant capital expenditures by our customers 
the sales cycle for our software ranges from to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
historically  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months from contract execution to complete software implementation 
during the sales and implementation cycles  we expend substantial time  effort and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the software 
we may not realize any revenues to offset these expenditures and  if we do  accounting principles may not allow us to recognize the revenues during corresponding periods 
this could harm our future operating results 
additionally  any decision by our customers to delay a purchase or implementation may adversely affect our revenues 
the healthcare industry faces financial constraints that could adversely affect the demand for our products and services the healthcare industry faces significant financial constraints 
for example  the shift to managed healthcare in the s put pressure on healthcare organizations to reduce costs  and the balanced budget act of dramatically reduced medicare reimbursement to healthcare organizations 
our software often involves a significant financial commitment by our customers 
our ability to grow our business is largely dependent on our customers information technology budgets 
to the extent healthcare information technology spending declines or increases more slowly than we anticipate  demand for our products would be adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and we cannot predict future profitability we had a net loss of million for the year ended december  we also had net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in in  we had net income of million  although we had a loss from operations of million 
we may continue to incur net losses and cannot predict when  or if  we will be profitable in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may cause our stock price to decline we have experienced significant variations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors  including our progress in implementing our strategy to address our sunrisexa response time issues and the level of costs associated with that effort  the timing  size and complexity of our product sales and implementations  overall demand for healthcare information technology  the financial condition of our customers and potential customers  market acceptance of new services  products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  product and price competition  the relative proportions of revenues we derive from software  services and hardware  changes in our operating expenses  the timing and size of future acquisitions  personnel changes  the performance of our products  significant estimates made by management in the application of generally accepted accounting principles  and fluctuations in general economic and financial market conditions  including interest rates 
it is difficult to predict the timing of revenues that we receive from product sales  because the sales cycle can vary depending upon several factors 
these include the size and terms of the transaction  the changing business plans of the customer  the effectiveness of the customer s management  general economic conditions and the regulatory environment 
in addition  the timing of our revenue recognition could vary considerably depending upon the extent to which our customers elect to license our products under arrangements where revenues are recognized monthly 
generally  less revenue is recognized under these arrangements during the first to months compared to traditional licensing arrangements 
we will also continue to offer contracts using our more traditional licensing arrangements 
because a significant percentage of our expenses will be relatively fixed  a variation in the timing of sales and implementations could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
stockholders should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance 
because in many cases we recognize revenues for our software monthly over the term of a customer contract  downturns or upturns in sales will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods we recognize a significant portion of our revenues from customers monthly over the terms of their agreements  which are typically years 
as a result  much of the revenue that we report each quarter is attributable to agreements executed during prior quarters 
consequently  a decline in sales  client renewals  or market acceptance of our products in one quarter  would not necessarily be reflected in revenues in that quarter  and may negatively affect our revenues and profitability in future quarters 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect these reduced revenues 
this monthly revenue recognition makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues through additional sales in any period  as revenues from new customers must be recognized over the applicable agreement term 
we operate in an intensely competitive market that includes companies that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do we operate in a market that is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cerner corporation  epic systems corporation  ge medical systems  idx systems corporation  mckesson corporation  quadramed corporation and siemens ag 
we also face competition from providers of practice management systems  general decision support  database systems and other segment specific applications  as well as from hit consultants 
a number of existing and potential competitors are more established than we are  and have greater name recognition and financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
we expect that competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could harm our business 
if the healthcare industry continues to undergo consolidation  this could impose pressure on our products prices  reduce our potential customer base and reduce demand for our products many hospitals have consolidated to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater market power 
if this consolidation continues  it could erode our customer base and could reduce the size of our target market 
in addition  the resulting enterprises could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to erosion of the prices for our products 
potential regulation by the us food and drug administration of our products as medical devices could impose increased costs  delay the introduction of new products and hurt our business the us food and drug administration  or fda  is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in the healthcare setting 
the fda has increasingly focused on the regulation of computer products and computer assisted products as medical devices under the food  drug  and cosmetic act  fdc act 
if the fda chooses to regulate any of our products as medical devices  it can impose extensive requirements upon us  including the following requiring us to seek fda clearance of a pre market notification submission demonstrating that a product is substantially equivalent to a device already legally marketed  or to obtain fda approval of a pre market approval application establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product  requiring us to comply with rigorous regulations governing the pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of medical devices  and requiring us to comply with the fda act regarding general controls including establishment registration  device listing  compliance with good manufacturing practices  reporting of specified device malfunctions and adverse device events 
if we fail to comply with applicable requirements  the fda could respond by imposing fines  injunctions or civil penalties  requiring recalls or product corrections  suspending production  refusing to grant pre market clearance or approval of products  withdrawing clearances and approvals  and initiating criminal prosecution 
any final fda policy governing computer products  once issued  may increase the cost and time to market of new or existing products or may prevent us from marketing our products 
changes in federal and state regulations relating to patient data could depress the demand for our products and impose significant product redesign costs on us the demand for health care information systems is affected by state and federal laws and regulations that govern the collection  use  transmission and other disclosures of electronic health information 
these laws and regulations may change rapidly and may be unclear or difficult to apply 
hipaa imposes national health data standards on i health care providers that conduct electronic health transactions  ii health care clearinghouses that convert health data between hipaa compliant and non compliant formats  and iii health plans 
collectively  these groups are known as covered entities 
the hipaa standards prescribe transaction formats and code sets for electronic health transactions  protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information  and require covered entities to implement administrative  physical and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality  integrity  availability and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form 
though we are not a covered entity  most of our customers are and require that our software and services be hipaa compliant 
there are several hipaa compliance deadlines for covered entities 
the final compliance deadline for the transaction and code set standards was october  the compliance deadline for the privacy standards was april  for most covered entities 
any failure or perception of failure of our products or services to comply with hipaa standards could adversely affect demand for our products and services  and force us to expend significant capital  research and development and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our customers 
states may adopt privacy standards that are more stringent than the federal hipaa privacy standards 
this may lead to different restrictions for handling individually identifiable health information 
as a result  our customers may demand information technology solutions and services that are adaptable to reflect different and changing regulatory requirements 
in the future  federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional restrictions on the collection  use  transmission and other disclosures of health information 
we cannot predict the potential impact that these future rules  as finally approved  may have on our business 
however  the demand for our products and services may decrease if we are not able to develop and offer products and services that can address the regulatory challenges and compliance obligations facing our customers 
our products are used to assist clinical decision making and provide information about patient medical histories and treatment plans  and if these products fail to provide accurate and timely information  our customers could assert claims against us that could result in substantial cost to us  harm our reputation in the industry and cause demand for our products to decline we provide products that  among other things  assist in clinical decision making  provide access to patient medical histories and assist in creating patient treatment plans 
if our software fails to provide accurate and timely information  customers could assert liability claims against us 
litigation with respect to liability claims  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  divert management s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products 
we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
in addition  we require that our customers approve all system rules and protocols 
despite these precautions  the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions 
however  this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us 
in addition  the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
one or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage 
highly complex software products such as ours often contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as updates and new versions are released 
it is particularly challenging for us to test our products because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy them 
despite testing  from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our products 
defects  errors or difficulties could cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with our products 
in addition  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of or delay in market acceptance 
if we undertake additional acquisitions  they may be disruptive to our business and could have an adverse effect on our future operations and the market price of our common stock an important element of our business strategy has been expansion through acquisitions 
since  we have completed nine acquisitions 
any future acquisitions would involve a number of risks  including the following the anticipated benefits from any acquisition may not be achieved 
the integration of acquired businesses requires substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could hurt our business 
in future acquisitions  we could issue additional shares of our capital stock  incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of book value  which could have a dilutive effect on future net income  if any  per share 
new business acquisitions must be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
these acquisitions may generate significant intangible assets and result in substantial related amortization charges to us 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified technical  marketing  sales and management personnel  our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired our success depends  in significant part  upon the continued services of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
competition for these employees is intense 
in addition  the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy can be difficult  time consuming and expensive 
we believe that our ability to implement our strategic goals depends to a considerable degree on our senior management team 
the loss of any member of that team could hurt our business 
changing customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products  which could harm our business and decrease our revenues the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the hit market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services  particularly our ability to continue to release our products onto microsoft s 
net framework under the sunrisexa initiative  and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
the process of developing products and services such as those we offer is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future as new technologies are introduced 
if we are unable to enhance our existing products or develop new products to meet changing customer requirements  demand for our products could suffer 
we depend on licenses from third parties for rights to the technology used in several of our products  and if we are unable to continue these relationships and maintain our rights to this technology  our business could suffer we depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products from a number of third party vendors  including computer corporation of america  computer associates  oracle corporation and microsoft 
most of these licenses expire within one to five years  can be renewed only by mutual consent and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time 
we may not be able to continue using the technology made available to us under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as a result  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments until we obtain equivalent technology  which could hurt our business 
most of our third party licenses are non exclusive 
our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses and use the technology to compete directly with us 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future or are unsuccessful in their continued research and development efforts  particularly with regard to microsoft  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 
our products rely on our intellectual property  and any failure by us to protect our intellectual property  or any misappropriation of it  could enable our competitors to market products with similar features  which could reduce demand for our products we are dependent upon our proprietary information and technology 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
also  despite the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products  reverse engineer our products or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in some limited instances  customers can access source code versions of our software  subject to contractual limitations on the permitted use of the source code 
although our license agreements with these customers attempt to prevent misuse of the source code  the possession of our source code by third parties increases the ease and likelihood of potential misappropriation of such software 
furthermore  others could independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights 
in addition  infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us 
regardless of the validity of any claims  defending against these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources 
the assertion of infringement claims could also result in injunctions preventing us from distributing products 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we might be required to obtain a license to the disputed intellectual property rights  which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
we face litigation that could force us to pay significant damages and could distract our management team from july through september  our company and three of its then current officers messrs 
robert j 
colletti  john t 
patton  jr 
and harvey j 
wilson were named in seven complaints filed by purported shareholders of our company in the united states district court  southern district of florida  west palm beach division  or the district court 
each complaint sought certification as a class and monetary damages  and alleged that we and the named officers violated federal securities laws 
we believe that the actions are without merit  and are conducting a vigorous defense 
on february   the district court issued an order consolidating all seven cases into one single case and appointed the city of philadelphia board of pensions and retirement  louis giannakokas and norman k 
mielziner to serve as lead plaintiffs 
on april   the plaintiffs filed with the district court an amended  consolidated complaint  the amended complaint 
on july   we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
on september   the plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion to dismiss  and we filed a reply brief on october  on november   the district court granted our motion to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety 
in so doing  the district court granted the plaintiffs fifteen days to file a further amended complaint that conforms to applicable law as well as the district court s ruling 
the plaintiffs subsequently obtained an extension of that fifteen day deadline 
on december   the plaintiffs filed with the district court their second amended complaint  or the second amended complaint 
in it  among other things  the plaintiffs reduced the class period by a total of eight months and eliminated numerous allegations that had been contained in their amended complaint 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint 
the plaintiffs filed opposition papers to our motion on february  in march  we will file a brief in further support of our motion 
at this time  our motion is pending 
we do not know when the district court will rule on our motion or whether our motion will be granted 
separately  in october  we were contacted by the attorneys for the lead plaintiffs who sought our consent to their filing of an amended complaint that would add new counts asserting new claims and a new class period due to our announced sunrisexa response time issues 
we did not formally respond to their request  and have not yet seen any pleadings filed in which the lead plaintiffs have sought to add or assert claims 
accordingly  we are unable to predict whether new claims may be filed against us  or what effect any new claims could have on our pending cases 
we are also unable to predict the nature of any new claims or the damages that may be sought if any new claims are filed 
we are involved in other litigation incidental to its business from time to time 
in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the ultimate outcome of such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit potential acquisition bids that a stockholder may believe is desirable  and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock 
our board of directors can fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of our company 
the issuance of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders 
we have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock 
in august  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan under which we issued preferred stock purchase rights that would adversely affect the economic and voting interests of a person or group that seeks to acquire us or a or more interest in our common stock without negotiations with our board of directors 
our charter documents contain additional anti takeover devices including only one of the three classes of directors is elected each year  the ability of our stockholders to remove directors  without cause  is limited  the right of stockholders to act by written consent has been eliminated  the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders has been eliminated  and advance notice must be given to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings 
section of the delaware corporate statute may inhibit potential bids to acquire our company 
we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware corporate statute  which regulates corporate acquisitions 
delaware law will prevent us from engaging  under specified circumstances  in a business combination with any interested stockholder for three years following the date that the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless our board of directors or a supermajority of our uninterested stockholders agree 
for purposes of delaware law  a business combination includes a merger or consolidation involving us and the interested stockholder  and the sale of more than of our assets 
in general  delaware law defines an interested stockholder as any holder beneficially owning or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or controlled by the holder 
these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction 
they could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock 
as a result  these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock from increasing substantially in response to actual or rumored takeover attempts 
these provisions may also prevent changes in our management

executive overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
eclipsys is a healthcare information technology company 
we develop and license our proprietary software to hospitals 
our software allows them to automate many of the key clinical  administrative and financial functions that they require 
our software is designed to improve patient care and patient satisfaction for our customers  and allow them to reduce their operating costs and enhance their revenues 
background we were founded in december to commercialize an integrated clinical and financial information software system for use by hospitals 
historically  hospitals have operated in a paper environment 
this environment has resulted in patient safety concerns  including avoidable medical errors  duplicative and unnecessary procedures  inefficient use of limited resources  and an inability to track  bill and collect for services rendered 
our software is designed to address these issues by turning data into information that can be easily used  accessed by or provided to the right person  at the right time  in the right place at a hospital 
this enables hospital employees to redesign business processes  deliver higher quality care at lower cost  and receive expedited payment for services rendered 
our software helps to improve collaboration within a hospital across all venues of care 
we initially grew through a series of strategic acquisitions which were completed in our acquisitions were focused on acquiring strong customer bases and advanced software pertaining to the healthcare industry 
our acquisitions are summarized in the following table functional method of transaction date area accounting alltel healthcare information services  inc  or alltel clinical purchase sdk medical computer services corporation  or sdk financial purchase emtek healthcare systems  or emtek a division of motorola  inc  or motorola clinical purchase healthvision  inc acquired by transition  or healthvision clinical purchase transition systems  inc  or transition decision support pooling powercenter systems  inc  or pcs enterprise resource planning pooling intelus corporation  or intelus  and meddata systems  inc  or med data  wholly owned subsidiaries of sun gard data systems  inc medical records purchase msi solutions  inc and msi integrated services  inc  or collectively msi integration pooling in addition to these acquisitions  in we licensed certain intellectual property on an exclusive basis from partners healthcare system  inc  or partners 
this intellectual property related to clinical workflows including order management and clinical decision support 
the partners technology has been incorporated within our product offerings 
product development since june  we have primarily focused on taking the intellectual property that we acquired through acquisitions and re expressing it on a common platform to provide integrated software to our customers 
in  we announced the general availability of scm  the first version of our sunrise suite of software 
scm provides advanced knowledge based clinical decision support capabilities including computerized physician order entry 
in  we announced our sunrisexa strategy 
this strategy is to migrate our sunrise suite of products to an open architecture and platform 
sunrisexa s architecture is built on microsoft s 
net framework  microsoft sql server and the microsoft windows family of operating systems 
in and  we announced the general availability of certain components of sunrisexa 
in october  we identified and announced certain response time issues within components of sunrisexa 
although some of our sunrisexa software components had been implemented in and were working at some customer sites  we determined that the software did not produce acceptable response times for the complex  high volume hospital environments 
to address the issue  we implemented a strategy to allow sunrisexa customers to continue their deployment of sunrisexa  while at the same time allowing us to continue our development of advanced sunrisexa components 
this strategy replaces the affected sunrisexa components with certain components from our scm product 
the response time issue resulted in a product delivery delay for certain of our advanced sunrisexa functionality 
the announcement of these issues also impacted the implementation schedules for a number of our customers 
we believe that this delay will have a temporary effect on our sales cycle for the affected sunrisexa applications 
in connection with the response time issue  we recorded a million write down of capitalized software development costs to net realizable value for certain sunrisexa components in the third quarter of the write down was included in the costs of systems and services revenue 
also  we believe that the correction of the response time issue may be covered by our warranty to our customers  and we intend to remediate the problem 
accordingly  we established a warranty reserve of million in the fourth quarter of related to the estimated costs associated with this issue 
the charge reflects our estimate of warranty related costs that include implementation and third party costs for customers affected by the response time issue 
actual warranty costs could differ materially from management s estimate 
professional services revenue and cash flows will be negatively impacted during the first half of as we deliver services and third party costs related to this issue 
operational initiatives during  management made two strategic decisions that significantly impacted our operating results 
first  we substantially increased our gross research and development spending  which includes research and development expenses and capitalized software development costs 
this decision was made to enable us to bring components of our sunrisexa product line to market more rapidly 
second  we invested heavily in sales and marketing to enhance market awareness surrounding the company and its products and services 
we did this to capitalize on perceived market demand for our products and services 
additionally  in  we moved aggressively to change our contracting model  offering customers payment terms over time compared to our historical licensing model in which software fees were paid in advance 
we took this approach to meet the needs of our customers  by matching the timing of their payments more closely to the value that we deliver to them 
we believe that this new contracting model makes purchase decisions easier for our customers 
the change in our contracting model has had a material affect on our business 
most notably  our revenues  gross margins  and cash flows have been affected by our adoption of this approach 
because customers now pay us over time for software and services  our revenue is spread over a longer time period  while a significant portion of our operating expenses remain relatively fixed 
for example  in  our gross margins  operating margins  and cash flow from operating activities were negatively impacted from lower upfront software payments 
however  we believe that this new contracting model will provide for more predictable revenues on a year over year basis 
we believe that over time  our margins will return to historical levels 
based upon the foregoing  we consumed cash in because cash collections under our new contracting method from new contract signings was not sufficient to offset our higher operating expenses 
to fund these initiatives  we used a portion of our cash on hand 
during  we expect to continue with these initiatives 
we believe that the most significant issues that we face in relate to the delivery of sunrisexa  which we expect to release in mid  as well as our ability to sign new business 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and adjusts its estimates and judgments  if necessary 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  software development and our warranty reserve 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services including consulting  implementation  and software maintenance for periods of to years 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our products and services are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software product  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our products and services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 staff accounting bulletin  or sab   revenue recognition in financial statements which has been superseded by sab and emerging issues task force  or eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sop and sab  as amended  require among other matters  that there be a signed contract evidencing an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
for those license arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the license revenue is recognized as payments become due 
for arrangements where vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  only exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop for software license arrangements that are bundled with services and maintenance where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method 
under these arrangements  software license fees and implementation fees are recognized over the implementation period  which has typically ranged from to months 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of labor hours incurred in relation to the total labor hours estimated under the agreement 
determining factors for percentage of completion include the nature of services required and the provision for payments of software and services upon the achievement of implementation milestones 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and could have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
we also enter into subscription arrangements that typically include multiple software products including the right to future products within the suites purchased  implementation and consulting services  maintenance and  where desired by the customer  outsourcing and remote hosting services 
the customer is entitled to these elements throughout the term of the arrangements  which range from to years 
payments are due annually  quarterly or monthly over the arrangement term 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the agreement 
in these arrangements  we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs and direct software implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize software development costs in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of the software being developed 
these costs include salaries  benefits  consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with coding and testing software products 
capitalization ceases when the products are generally released for sale to customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
at each balance sheet date  we perform a detailed assessment of our capitalized software development costs which includes a review of  among other factors  projected revenues  customer demand requirements  product lifecycle  changes in software and hardware technologies  and product development plans 
based on this analysis we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect the net realizable value of our capitalized software development costs 
the estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software  the remaining economic life of the software  or both  could change  materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs  as well as our consolidated operating results in the period of change 
on october   we announced response time issues with some components of sunrisexa  the newest version of our sunrise suite of products 
to address the issue  we announced a strategy to allow our sunrisexa customers to continue their deployment of sunrisexa  while enabling us to continue the development of our advanced sunrisexa components 
our strategy is to replace the affected sunrisexa components with certain components from our scm product 
as a result  in we recorded a million write down of capitalized software development costs for certain sunrisexa components to net realizable value 
the write down is included in the cost of systems and services revenues 
warranty reserve the agreements that we use to license our software include a limited warranty 
the warranty provides that our software  in its unaltered form  will perform substantially in accordance with the related documentation 
through september   we did not incur any material warranty costs related to our products 
due to the response time issues that we identified in october  we recorded a warranty reserve of million at december  warranty costs are charged to costs of systems and services revenues when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
in determining this warranty reserve  we used significant judgments and estimates for the additional professional service hours and third party costs that will be necessary to remedy this issue on a customer by customer basis 
the timing and amount of our warranty reserve could have been different if we had used other judgments or assumptions in our evaluation 
results of operations revenues we derive revenues from licensing our software and the delivery of services including software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting  outsourcing  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 
our products and services are generally sold to customers under contracts that range in duration from to years  and years for some outsourcing contracts 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs are the amortization of capitalized software development costs  acquired technology and a network services intangible asset 
capitalized software development costs are amortized generally over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related product  or are based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable product 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset  and the remaining balance became fully amortized in march cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes only our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a write down of capitalized software costs to net realizable value of certain components of our sunrisexa software in the amount of million 
this related to the sunrisexa response time issue discussed above 
additionally  we recorded a warranty reserve of million during the fourth quarter of related to anticipated costs of our sunrisexa response time issue 
this warranty reserve reflects an estimate of implementation and third party costs for certain customers 
the write down and warranty reserve are included in the costs of systems and services revenues 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions  and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs and events  public relations  trade shows  advertising  and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead  as well as consultants for the design  development and testing of new products 
we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of the costs of systems and services revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which generally range from to years  and may reach years for outsourcing contracts 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consisted of the value of ongoing customer relationships and goodwill  have been amortized based upon their estimated economic lives at the time of the acquisition  and vary among acquisitions 
our acquired customer relationships became fully amortized in january of in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 our amortization of goodwill ceased as of january   leaving a recorded balance of  for goodwill as of december  on at least an annual basis  we conduct an impairment review of our remaining goodwill balance 
as of december   there was no impairment of the remaining goodwill balance 
taxes as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
the carryforwards expire in varying amounts through and are subject to certain restrictions 
we did not record a benefit for the resulting net deferred tax asset at december   or  because we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
statement of operations in thousands  except per share data of total of total revenue revenue change change revenues systems and services hardware total revenues costs and expenses costs of systems and services revenues costs of hardware revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss basic net loss per share diluted net loss per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the increase in systems and services revenues in was primarily a result of increases in revenue generated from arrangements  which generally provide for revenue recognition on a monthly basis 
these revenues include license fees  remote hosting services  software and hardware maintenance fees  and outsourcing services 
the overall increase in revenues is a result of higher volumes of new contracts 
the new contracts consisted of a significantly higher proportion of contracts executed for which revenues are recognized on a monthly basis 
we expect these contracts will continue to represent a significant  and potentially growing  proportion of our new contracts 
however  because these contracts are characterized by payments being spread over a longer period of time compared to traditional licensing arrangements  we expect cash flows will continue to be negatively impacted in the near future 
additionally  professional services and third party revenues increased as a result of a higher volume of new contracts 
hardware revenues increased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the increase in hardware revenues in was primarily due to increased shipments during the third  and fourth quarters of for business contracted during the second  third  and fourth quarters 
we expect hardware revenue to continue to fluctuate in future periods 
cost of systems and services revenues increased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for gross margins on systems and services revenues were for the year ended december  compared to for the increase in cost of systems and services revenues was related to several factors  including the warranty reserve for anticipated costs  and the write down of capitalized software development costs to net realizable value  both related to sunrisexa response time issue  higher amortization of capitalized software development costs related to the release of sunrisexa  higher third party costs including royalties and consulting  higher costs associated with providing our outsourcing  remote hosting and networking services  and increased payroll and related costs associated with providing our implementation and integration services related to higher volumes of new contracts 
these increases were partially offset by lower amortization of acquired technology  and due to some assets becoming fully amortized during and the first quarter of cost of hardware revenues increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in cost of hardware revenues for was primarily attributable to the increase in hardware revenues discussed above 
gross margin on hardware revenues was relatively consistent at in and in sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was related to increased payroll and related costs due to our initiative to significantly expand the size of our sales and marketing organization  including approximately million higher commissions resulting from increased sales volume 
we expect that sales and marketing will continue at these higher expense levels in the future 
research and development expenses increased million  or to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for gross spending on research and development  consisting of research and development expenses and capitalized software development costs  increased approximately million primarily due to our initiative to accelerate the migration of our products onto the microsoft 
net platform 
in  under this initiative  we increased the number of employees in our research and development organization  and increased the use of outside consultants 
the percentage of research and development expenditures capitalized for the year ended december  was  or million  compared to  or million  for the percentage of research and development costs capitalized increased as a result of the incremental expenses incurred during the second  third and fourth quarters of for coding and testing of two releases of sunrisexa products that were technologically feasible  one of which was generally released during the third quarter 
as discussed above  amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included in cost of systems and services revenues  increased by approximately million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher insurance premiums and legal costs 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the increase was primarily the result of investments in computer hardware and software to expand our research and development infrastructure and to increase capacity at our technology solutions center to address the higher volume of remote hosting services 
as a result of continuing investments  we expect depreciation and amortization to continue to increase in the future 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for this decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decline in yields  related to changes in general economic conditions 
a decline in the average combined balance in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities during the third and fourth quarters of also contributed to the decrease in interest income 
as a result of these factors  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  statement of operations in thousands  except per share data of total of total revenue revenue change change revenues systems and services hardware total revenues costs and expenses costs of systems and services revenues costs of hardware revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative depreciation and amortization pooling and transaction costs total costs and expenses loss from operations interest income  net loss income before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss income basic net loss income per share diluted net loss income per share year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from million for systems and services revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in systems and services revenues in was primarily a result of minimal software license fees in the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in license fees was the result of a shortfall in new sales bookings during the third quarter of and the second quarter of  which negatively impacted revenues during the last three quarters of additionally  the decrease was related to a change in contracting mix in the last two quarters of  in which we began to predominantly contract under arrangements that provide for revenue to be recognized on a monthly basis as compared to our historical contracting methods 
since the third quarter of  the majority of our contracts have been executed under these types of arrangements 
as we continue to contract under these arrangements  we expect our operating results to reflect lower revenues and cash flows in the short term 
in addition  we believe that some of our customers and prospects delayed their decisions to purchase our products in anticipation of the initial sunrisexa releases in furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  we began an initiative to expand our sales and marketing functions 
under this initiative  our sales and marketing team grew from approximately persons at december   to more than persons at december   including the addition of a new executive vice president responsible for all sales activities and other key management positions 
this program was implemented to increase the market presence of our sales organization and to enhance the market awareness of our company  its products and services 
during this expansion  our sales and marketing organization experienced considerable change and administrative disruption  which negatively impacted the closing of new contracts during the second quarter of hardware revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the decrease in hardware revenues in was primarily due to decreased shipments under contracts entered into in and the lower shipments were primarily attributable to a higher percentage of new contracts being remotely hosted as well as the shortfall in bookings during the second quarter of cost of systems and services revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for these costs decreased primarily due to lower amortization of acquisition related acquired technology and network services assets  which amounted to million for  compared to million for  as a result of certain assets becoming fully amortized 
these reductions were partially offset by various other factors including higher software royalties  higher payroll related costs  in particular medical insurance  higher amortization of capitalized software development costs as a result of certain new products  such as new releases of our sunrise suite  including sunrisexa  becoming available for general release  and incremental costs of million related to additional obligations arising from contracts assumed in prior acquisitions 
cost of hardware revenues decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for the decrease in cost of hardware revenues for was directly attributable to the decreased shipments of hardware related the items discussed above 
gross margins on hardware revenues was relatively consistent at in and in sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to the program we initiated  during the fourth quarter of  to significantly expand the size of our sales and marketing organization 
this program continued in additionally  there was an increase in expenditures for marketing events held in  as compared to research and development expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to an initiative we implemented in the fourth quarter of this initiative was designed to accelerate the migration onto the microsoft 
net platform of our sunrisexa products 
this initiative is expected to result in continued heightened research and development expenses 
the percentage of gross research and development expenditures capitalized for the year ended december  was  or million  compared to  or million  for as discussed above  amortization of capitalized software development costs  which is included as a component of cost of systems and services revenues  increased by approximately million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or to million  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended the increase in general and administrative expenses was the result of higher legal expenses  primarily related to our shareholder litigation  and higher insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the decrease was primarily the result of lower acquisition related amortization  which amounted to million in  compared to million in this decline related to the completion of amortization of certain intangibles  which became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of  as well as the adoption of sfas  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
the decrease in amortization was partially offset by higher depreciation of fixed assets purchased during and pooling and transaction costs in for integration pertaining to one of our acquisitions was approximately million less than previously estimated 
interest income decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for this decrease was a result of significantly lower interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents in  compared to  due to lower interest rates 
the effect of lower interest rates was only partially offset by higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents throughout  compared to cash and cash equivalents increased during primarily from cash generated from operating activities 
as a result of these factors  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net income of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during  operating activities used million of cash  primarily as a result of heightened research and development activities  costs related to the expansion of our sales and marketing forces and the impact of our new contract arrangements 
investing activities used million of cash  consisting of million of capitalized software development costs and million for the procurement of property and equipment 
the property and equipment was primarily related to activities at our technology solutions center for the expansion of our remote hosting function and activities in our research and development area 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents balance of million 
it is likely that we will continue to have negative cash flows in the near future as we continue our development efforts in connection with our sunrisexa initiative 
additionally  our new contracting method will result in lower cash flows during the early stages of a customer contract 
we expect this will continue to impact our short term cash position 
furthermore  we expect that capital expenditures will continue at levels similar to or greater than as we continue to invest in our technology solutions center 
our future liquidity requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and level of our new sales volumes  the cost of our development efforts related to sunrisexa  the success and market acceptance of our future product releases  and other related items 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our current cash and marketable securities balances  combined with anticipated cash collections from our customers will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements through contracts and commitments the following table provides information related to our contractual cash obligations under various financial and commercial agreements as of december  in thousands payments due by period more less than than total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligation the unconditional purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase commitments for telecommunication services  computer equipment  maintenance  consulting  airplane charters and other commitments 
the contract for airplane charters is discussed in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  related party transactions included herein 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
the interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  or vie  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
this interpretation applies immediately to each vie created after january  and to each vie in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
in december  the fasb published a revision to fin or fin r  to clarify some of the provisions of fin and exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under fin r  a legal entity is considered a vie with some exceptions if specific criteria are met including whether it has sufficient equity at risk to finance its own activities without relying on financial support from other parties 
additional criteria must be applied to determine if this condition is met or if the equity holders  as a group  lack any one of the three stipulated characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
if the legal entity is a vie  then the reporting entity determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie must consolidate it 
even if the reporting entity is not required to consolidate a vie  then certain disclosures must be made about the vie if the reporting entity has a significant variable interest 
the effective date of the interpretation was modified under fin r 
a reporting entity is required to apply the provisions of fin r to each vie that previously was subject to certain previously issued special purpose entity  or spe  accounting pronouncements for all reporting periods after december  for each vie  a reporting entity is required to adopt the provisions of fin r for all reporting periods after march  we believe fin r will not impact our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the primary purpose of sab is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element arrangements  superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the guidance contained in sab reflects the issuance of eitf  but the revenue recognition principles remain largely unchanged 
as we have already incorporated eitf and sab  into our revenue recognition policies  the adoption of sab did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally buy investments with maturities of days or less 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
