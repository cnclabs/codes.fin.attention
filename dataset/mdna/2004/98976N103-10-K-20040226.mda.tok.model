the company exercised judgment as of december  and  and did not provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset believing that it is more likely than not that future taxable income and tax planning will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax asset 
the company based this decision on the cumulative profitability of the past three years and the anticipated taxable income in the future 
however  the guidelines provided by sfas are stringent and if the company is unable to provide positive evidence that the deferred tax asset is recoverable  it will be required to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset
