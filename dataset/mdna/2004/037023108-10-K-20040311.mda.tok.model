general anthracite capital  inc the company is a commercial real estate finance company organized as a real estate investment trust reit that earns income based on the difference between the yield on its assets and the cost of its liabilities 
the company s primary long term objective is to distribute consistent dividends supported by earnings 
the company s primary focus is the purchase and origination of high yielding commercial real estate securities and loans 
over the long term  the company s earnings are primarily maintained by consistent credit performance on its commercial real estate investments  investment performance  stability of the capital structure  and reinvestment rates 
exclusive of the writedowns incurred by the company during  the company s commercial real estate credit performance has been within expectations 
delinquencies and underlying loan losses realized will continue to rise as the portfolio matures but the company believes it has adequate loss reserves reflected in its loss adjusted yields 
the company s capital structure strategy is to issue liabilities that match the cash flow characteristics of its portfolio of investments through the issuance of non recourse collateralized debt obligations cdos in conjunction with fixed rate preferred stock offerings and common stock offerings 
the company establishes its dividend by analyzing the long term sustainability of earnings given existing market conditions and the current composition of its portfolio 
this includes an analysis of the company s credit loss assumptions  reported net interest income  general level of interest rates  realized gains and losses  and projected hedging costs 
at the end of the third quarter of  the company decided to accelerate its strategic reduction of residential mortgage backed securities rmbs due to the volatility of interest rates and structural changes in the rmbs market 
the shift out of rmbs will decrease the company s exposure to interest rate volatility 
the pace of reinvestment achieved during the fourth quarter of is consistent with the portfolio repositioning plan 
the company sold rmbs to reduce interest rate volatility and replaced them with predominantly investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
the company expects earnings to rise when its capital is fully redeployed into higher yielding non investment grade commercial real estate assets 
the company continues to maintain a positive  though controlled  exposure to both long and short term rates through its active hedging strategies 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of interest rates and their effect on earnings and book value 
the company s earnings for the year ended december  includes a charge of per share which resulted from an increase in expected underlying loan losses on certain vintage trusts where the company through its investment in subordinated cmbs of such trusts is in the first loss position 
as a result of this investment position  the company controls the workout process on the underlying loans controlling class 
the increase in loss expectations triggered an impairment charge according to the company s accounting policies and as required by the accounting standard eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf the increase in expected losses on these vintage controlling class cmbs assets will decrease the company s income by approximately per share annually 
the company s earnings for the year ended december  also includes a write down of per share on a franchise loan backed security 
the company determined it was unlikely that further payments will be received from this franchise loan backed security and wrote this security down to zero  despite the servicer reporting a par balance of  as of september  as of december   the servicer continues to report a par of  additionally during the year ended december  the company incurred net realized and unrealized losses of per share  which are attributable to the rmbs portfolio and expenses of hedging that portfolio 
to hedge the rmbs portfolio the company entered into interest rate swaps and treasury futures to reduce exposure to rising interest rates 
each of these hedging instruments was designated as held for trading  therefore  changes in their value were marked to market through the company s consolidated statements of operations 
this action significantly reduced the interest rate sensitivity of the company s rmbs portfolio 
however  the loss in value of the hedges greatly exceeded the change in value of the assets in the held for trading account 
this loss is recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operations rather than accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of financial condition

commercial real estate securities portfolio activity the company continues to increase its investments in commercial real estate securities 
commercial real estate securities include cmbs and investment grade reit debt

the distinction between the two is in the controlling class rights the company obtains with its investment in controlling class cmbs 
controlling class rights allow the company to control the workout and or disposition of defaults that occur in the underlying loans 
these securities absorb the first losses realized in the underlying loan pools 
the company s other below investment grade cmbs have no rights associated with its ownership to control the workout and or disposition of underlying loan defaults  however  these investments are not the first to absorb losses in the underlying pools 
the coupon payment on the non rated security can also be reduced for special servicer fees charged to the trust 
the next highest rated security in the structure will then generally be downgraded to non rated and becomes the first to absorb losses and expenses from that point on

other than the impairment taken during the quarter ended june   the company currently does not believe the  of par reduction requires an impairment or a change in loss assumptions 
further delinquencies and losses may cause the par reductions to continue and cause the company to conclude that a change in loss adjusted yield is required along with a write down of the adjusted purchase price through the income statement according to eitf also during  the loan pools were paid down by  pay down proceeds are distributed to the highest rated cmbs class first and reduce the percent of total underlying collateral represented by each rating category 
for all of the company s controlling class securities  the company assumes that a total of of the original loan balance will not be recoverable 
this estimate was developed based on an analysis of individual loan characteristics and prevailing market conditions at the time of origination 
this loss estimate equates to cumulative expected defaults of approximately over the life of the portfolio and an average assumed loss severity of of the defaulted loan balance 
all estimated workout expenses including special servicer fees are included in these assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from these estimated results 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of how differences between estimated and actual losses could affect company earnings 
the company monitors credit performance on a monthly basis and debt service coverage ratios on a quarterly basis 
using these and other statistics  the company maintains watch lists for loans that are delinquent thirty days or more and for loans that are not delinquent but have issues that the company s management believes require close monitoring 
the company plans to perform a detailed re underwriting of a substantial number of the underlying loans supporting its controlling class cmbs within the next nine months 
upon completion  the company may determine that its gaap yields and book values need to be adjusted 
the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide to be the most relevant benchmark to measure credit performance and market conditions applicable to its controlling class cmbs holdings 
the year of issuance  or vintage year  is important  as older loan pools will tend to have more delinquencies than newly underwritten loans 
the company owns controlling class cmbs issued in    and comparable delinquency statistics referenced by vintage year as a percentage of par outstanding as of december  are shown in the table below vintage underlying delinquencies lehman brothers year collateral outstanding conduit guide total  weighted average based on current principal balance net of defeased loans 
morgan stanley also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies for the specific cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral and that have been seasoned for at least one year 
this seasoning criterion will generally adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral 
as of december   the morgan stanley index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were  and as of december   this same index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for a detailed discussion of how delinquencies and loan losses affect the company 
delinquencies on the company s cmbs collateral as a percent of principal increased in line with expectations 
the company s aggregate delinquency experience is consistent with comparable data provided in the lehman brothers conduit guide 
of the delinquent loans shown on the chart in note of the consolidated financial statements  four loans were real estate owned and being marketed for sale  four loans were in foreclosure  and the remaining loans were in some form of workout negotiations 
aggregate realized losses of  were realized during year ended december  this brings cumulative net losses realized to  which is of total estimated losses 
these losses include special servicer and other workout expenses 
this experience to date is in line with the company s loss expectations 
realized losses are expected to increase on the underlying loans as the portfolio ages 
special servicer expenses are also expected to increase as portfolios mature and us employment activity remains weak 
the company manages its credit risk through disciplined underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to control the workout process for delinquent loans as early as possible 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions 
the comparative profiles of the loans underlying the company s cmbs by property type as of december  and for the two prior years are as follows exposure exposure exposure of property type loan balance of total loan balance total loan balance of total multifamily    retail    office    lodging    industrial    healthcare    parking    total    of this total  of loans have been defeased and are now secured by treasury securities  thereby removing real estate and borrower risk 
of this total  of loans have been defeased and are now secured by treasury securities  thereby removing real estate and borrower risk 
as of december   the fair market value of the company s holdings of controlling class cmbs is  lower than the adjusted cost for these securities 
the adjusted purchase price of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
the market value of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio as of december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures  the company expects to recoup the unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the purchase analysis 
as of december   the company believes there has been no material deterioration in the credit quality of its portfolio below current expectations 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded which would negatively affect their market value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced market value will negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the market value of the securities 
during the company experienced four rating upgrades and one rating downgrade on its cmbs 
the company s generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap income for its cmbs securities is computed based upon a yield  which assumes credit losses would occur 
the yield to compute the company s taxable income does not assume there would be credit losses  as a loss can only be deducted for tax purposes when it has occurred 
as a result  for the years through december   the company s gaap income accrued on its cmbs assets was approximately  lower than the taxable income accrued on the cmbs assets 
commercial real estate loan activity the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally emphasizes larger transactions located in metropolitan markets  as compared to the typical loan in the cmbs portfolio 
the company has never suffered a loss in this portfolio 
because the loan portfolio is relatively small and heterogeneous  the company has determined it is not necessary to establish a loan loss reserve 
in june  the borrower submitted payment in an attempt to fully repay the loan on a los angeles office building in connection with the borrower s sale of the property 
upon the sale of the property securing this loan  and pursuant to the loan documents  the company was entitled to a supplemental exit fee that was to be paid upon repayment of the loan 
the borrower has refused to pay the supplemental exit fee

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated its investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and their values must be estimated by management 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported net income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment by management is required in this analysis which includes  but is not limited to  making assumptions regarding the collectibility of the principal and interest  net of related expenses  on the underlying loans 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its mortgage securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events which may alter the assumptions 
the company adopted eitf on april  the company recognizes interest income from its purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial interests beneficial interests other than beneficial interests of high credit quality  sufficiently collateralized to ensure that the possibility of credit loss is remote  or that cannot contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the company would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment in accordance with this guidance 
accordingly  on a quarterly basis  when significant changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  the company calculates a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date and the revised cash flows 
the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
prior to april   the company recognized income from these beneficial interests using the effective interest method  based on an anticipated yield over the projected life of the security 
changes in the anticipated yields were calculated due to revisions in the company s estimates of future and actual credit losses and prepayments 
changes in anticipated yields resulting from credit loss and prepayment revisions were recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment at the date of the change which reflected the change in income from the security from the date of purchase through the date of change in the anticipated yield 
the new yield was then used prospectively to account for interest income 
changes in yields from reduced estimates of losses were recognized prospectively 
for other mortgage backed and related mortgage securities  the company accounts for interest income under sfas no 
 using the effective yield method which includes the amortization of discount or premium arising at the time of purchase and the stated or coupon interest payments 
as a result of the closing of cdo i at the end of the first quarter  the company reclassified all of its subordinated cmbs on its consolidated statement of financial condition from available for sale to held to maturity 
the effect of this reclassification changed the accounting basis for these securities  prospectively  from fair market value to adjusted cost 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 the interest rate swap agreements entered into by the company to hedge the variable rate exposure of the debt of cdo i are required to be presented on the balance sheet at their fair market value 
accordingly  the company determined that at december   and going forward  it would classify all of its subordinated cmbs as available for sale securities and record them at fair market value 
this is consistent with the mark to market requirement for the cdo s interest rate swap agreements 
the reclassification of these securities to available for sale from held to maturity increased the recorded value of these securities from  to  with the difference being recorded in other comprehensive income 
the circumstance causing the company to change this classification was not considered a permitted circumstance as stated in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 and is therefore inconsistent with the company s intent regarding its held to maturity classification 
accordingly  the company will be prohibited from classifying its subordinated cmbs current holdings as well as future purchases as held to maturity for a period of two years 
securities held for trading the company has designated certain other securities as held for trading 
securities held for trading are also carried at estimated fair value  but changes in fair value are included in income 
the valuations of these securities and the interest income recognized are subject to the same uncertainties as those discussed above 
mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has an investment in a private opportunity fund which invests in commercial mortgage loans and is managed by the manager 
management must periodically evaluate each loan for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for probable losses and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment of management is required in determining impairment and the resulting loss allowance which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the value of the real estate which secures the mortgage loan 
to date  the company has determined that no loss allowances have been necessary on the loans in its portfolio or held by the opportunity fund 
real estate joint ventures the company makes investments in real estate entities over which the company exercises significant influence  but not control 
the real estate held by such entities must be regularly reviewed for impairment  and would be written down to its estimated fair value  through earnings  if impairment is determined to exist 
this review involves assumptions about the future operating results of the real estate and market factors  all of which are subjective and difficult to predict 
to date  the company has determined that none of the real estate held by its joint ventures is impaired 
derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  the company s management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as hedging borrowings  securities available for sale  securities held for trading  or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported 
impairment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 when the estimated fair value of the security classified as available for sale has been below amortized cost for a significant period of time and the company concludes that it no longer has the ability or intent to hold the security for the period of time over which the company expects the values to recover to amortized cost  the investment is written down to its fair value 
the resulting charge is included in income  and a new cost basis is established 
additionally  under eitf  when significant changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included in income  and a new cost basis established 
in both instances  the original discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established 
the company performed an analysis of its current underlying loan loss expectations and credit performance of its vintage controlling class cmbs 
the company increased expected underlying loan loss expectations on four securities from three vintage controlling class cmbs transactions 
as a result of the increase in loss expectations  the company recorded an impairment charge of  during the second quarter of  to reduce the amortized cost of these securities to their fair value  as required by emerging issue task force standard  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf 
three of the four impaired securities are not rated and the fourth security is rated ccc by fitch ratings 
securities which are not rated are highly sensitive to changes in the timing of losses recognized on the underlying loans 
even though actual losses recognized on the underlying loans to date are still significantly less than original estimates  the company believes that losses in will continue to rise due to weak conditions in many commercial real estate markets 
the company believes it was appropriate to increase the total amount of expected losses of these transactions 
after taking into account the effect of the impairment charge  income is recognized under eitf or sfas no

 consolidated financial statements  to variable interest entities vie and generally would require that the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of a vie be consolidated into the financial statements of the enterprise that has a controlling financial interest in it 
the interpretation provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be evaluated for consolidation based on voting interests or significant financial support provided to the entity variable interests 
an entity is classified as a vie if total equity is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities through voting rights  absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur or receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
once an entity is determined to be a vie  its assets  liabilities  and results of operations should be consolidated with those of its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity which either will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or has the right to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
the expected losses and residual returns of a vie include expected variability in its net income or loss  fees to decision makers and fees to guarantors of substantially all of vie assets or liabilities and are calculated in accordance with statement of financial accounting concept no

net interest margin and net interest spread from the portfolio the company considers its portfolio to consist of its securities available for sale  mortgage loan pools  commercial mortgage loans  and cash and cash equivalents because these assets relate to its core strategy of acquiring and originating high yield loans and securities backed by commercial real estate  while at the same time maintaining a portfolio of investment grade securities to enhance the company s liquidity 
net interest margin from the portfolio is annualized net interest income divided by the average market value of interest earning assets 
net interest income is total interest income less interest expense relating to collateralized borrowings 
net interest spread equals the yield on average assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period 
the yield on average assets is interest income divided by average amortized cost of interest earning assets 
the average cost of funds is interest expense from the portfolio divided by average outstanding collateralized borrowings 
the following chart describes the interest income  interest expense  net interest margin and net interest spread for the company s portfolio

tax basis income was  or diluted per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net income as calculated in accordance with gaap of  or diluted per share 
differences between tax basis net income and gaap net income arise for various reasons 
for example  in computing income from its controlling class cmbs for gaap purposes  the company takes into account estimated credit losses on the underlying loans  whereas for tax basis income purposes  only actual credit losses are taken into account 
certain general and administrative expenses may differ due to differing treatment of the deductibility of such expenses for tax basis income 
also  differences could arise in the treatment of premium and discount amortization on the company s securities available for sale 
changes in financial condition securities available for sale the company s securities available for sale  which are carried at estimated fair value  included the following at december  and december  december  december  estimated estimated fair fair security description value percentage value percentage commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs ios   investment grade cmbs   non investment grade rated subordinated securities   non rated subordinated securities   credit tenant lease   investment grade reit debt   total cmbs   single family residential mortgage backed securities agency adjustable rate securities   agency fixed rate securities   residential cmos   hybrid arms   project loans  total rmbs   total securities available for sale   the increase in the cmbs and reit debt is attributable to the attractive opportunities available to the company to match fund these assets in the cdo market

the company s financial flexibility is affected by its ability to renew or replace on a continuous basis its maturing short term borrowings 
as of december  and  the company has obtained financing in amounts and at interest rates consistent with the company s short term financing objectives 
under the lines of credit  term loans  and the reverse repurchase agreements  the lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to market value 
a reduction in the value of its pledged assets would require the company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls 
most of the company s reverse repurchase agreements are collateralized by rmbs which can be readily liquidated

capital resources and liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the company s ability to meet cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  loan acquisition and lending activities  and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of collateralized borrowings  principal and interest payments on and maturities of securities available for sale  securities held for trading  commercial mortgage loans  and proceeds from the maturity or sales thereof 
the company finances itself with its own equity  follow on equity offerings  preferred stock offerings  secured term debt  committed financing facilities  and reverse repurchase agreements 
an important part of the company s risk analysis includes a thorough assessment of the financing alternatives in the context of the assets being financed 
reverse repurchase agreements are secured loans generally with a term of days 
the interest rate is based on day london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread that is determined based on the asset pledged as security 
the terms include a daily mark to market provision that requires the posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
after the day period expires  there is no obligation for the lender to extend credit for an additional period 
this type of financing is generally available only for more liquid securities 
the interest rate charged on reverse repurchase agreements is usually the lowest relative to the alternatives due to the lower risk inherent in these transactions 
committed financing facilities represent multi year agreements to provide secured financing for a specific asset class 
these facilities include a daily mark to market provision requiring posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines in excess of a threshold amount 
a significant difference between committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements is the term of the financing 
a committed facility provider is generally required to provide financing for the full term of the agreement  usually two to three years  rather than thirty days as generally used in the reserve repurchase market 
this longer term makes the financing of less liquid assets viable 
issuance of secured term debt is generally done through a collateralized debt obligation offering 
this entails creating a special purpose entity that holds assets used to secure the payments required of the debt issued 
as this transaction is considered a financing  the spe is fully consolidated on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asset cash flows are generally matched with the debt service requirements over their respective lives and an interest rate swap is used to match the fixed or floating rate nature of the coupon payments where necessary 
this type of transaction is usually referred to as match funding or term financing the assets 
there is no mark to market requirement in this structure and the debt cannot be called or terminated by the bondholders 
furthermore  the debt issued is non recourse to the issuer therefore permanent reductions in value do not affect the liquidity of the company 
however  since the company expects to earn a positive spread between the income generated by the assets and the expense of the debt issued  a permanent impairment of any of the assets would negatively affect the spread over time 
the company may issue preferred stock from time to time as a source of long term or permanent capital 
preferred stock generally has a fixed coupon and may have a fixed term in the form of a maturity date or other redemption or conversion feature 
the preferred stockholder typically has the right to a preferential distribution for dividends and any liquidity proceeds 
another source of permanent capital is the issuance of common stock through a follow on offering 
this allows investors to purchase a large block of common stock in one transaction 
a common stock issuance can be accretive to the company s book value per share if the issue price per share exceeds the company s book value per share 
it can also be accretive to earnings per share if the company deploys the new capital into assets that generate a risk adjusted return that exceeds the return of the company s existing assets 
furthermore  earnings accretion can also be achieved at reinvestment rates that are lower than the return on existing assets if common stock is issued at a premium to book value 
the company continuously evaluates the market for follow on common stock offerings as well as the available opportunities to deploy new capital on an accretive basis 
during and  the company did not issue any common stock in follow on equity offerings 
in  the company issued  shares of common stock in two follow on offerings at an average price of per share 
additionally  for the years ended december  and  respectively  the company issued  and  shares of common stock under its dividend reinvestment plan 
net proceeds to the company were approximately  and  respectively 
at december   the company s collateralized borrowings had the following remaining maturities total lines of reverse repurchase collateralized collateralized credit agreements debt obligations borrowings within days   to days days to less than year   year to years   over years   comprised of  of cdo debt with a weighted average remaining maturity of years as of december  and  of cdo debt with a weighted average remaining maturity of years as of december  in addition  the company has no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contingent liability during  the company completed the acquisition of core cap  inc the merger was a stock for stock acquisition where the company issued  shares of its common stock and  shares of its series b preferred stock 
at the time of the core cap acquisition  blackrock financial management  inc the manager agreed to pay gmac core cap  inc 
s external advisor  over a ten year period installment payment to purchase the right to manage the assets under the existing management contract gmac contract 
the gmac contract had to be terminated in order to allow for the company to complete the merger  as the company s management agreement with the manager did not provide for multiple managers 
as a result the manager offered to buy out the gmac contract as the manager estimated it would receive incremental fees above and beyond the installment payment  and thus was willing to pay for  and separately negotiate  the termination of the gmac contract 
accordingly  the value of the installment payment was not considered in the company s allocation of its purchase price to the net assets acquired in the acquisition of core cap  inc the company agreed that should the management agreement with its manager be terminated  not renewed or not extended for any reason other than for cause  the company would pay to the manager an amount equal to the installment payment less the sum of all payments made by the manager to gmac 
as of december   the installment payment would be  payable over eight years 
the company does not accrue for this contingent liability 
transactions with affiliates the company has a management agreement with the manager  a majority owned indirect subsidiary of the pnc financial services group  inc pnc bank and the employer of certain directors and officers of the company  under which the manager manages the company s day to day operations  subject to the direction and oversight of the company s board of directors 
on march   the management agreement was extended for one year through march   with the approval of the unaffiliated directors  on terms similar to the prior agreement with the following changes i the incentive fee calculation would be based on gaap earnings instead of funds from operations  ii the removal of the four year period to value the management agreement in the event of termination and iii subsequent renewal periods of the management agreement would be for one year instead of two years 
the board was advised by houlihan lokey howard zukin financial advisors  inc  a national investment banking and financial advisory firm  in the renewal process 
on march   the unaffiliated directors approved an extension of the management agreement from its expiration of march  for one year through march  the terms of the renewed agreement are similar to the prior agreement except for the incentive fee calculation which would provide for a rolling four quarter high watermark rather than a quarterly calculation 
in determining the rolling four quarter high watermark  the company would calculate the incentive fee based upon the current and prior three quarters net income 
the manager would be paid an incentive fee in the current quarter if the incentive fee based upon the current and prior three quarters net income yearly incentive fee is greater than what was paid to the manager in the prior three quarters cumulatively 
the company will phase in the rolling four quarter high watermark commencing with the second quarter of calculation of the incentive fee will be based on gaap and adjusted to exclude special one time events pursuant to changes in gaap accounting pronouncements after discussion between the manager and the unaffiliated directors 
the incentive fee threshold did not change 
the high watermark will be based on the existing incentive fee hurdle  which provides for the manager to be paid of the amount of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap per share that exceeds the product of the adjusted issue price of the company s common stock per share as of december  and the greater of or basis points over the ten year treasury note 
the company anticipates that the management agreement will be extended prior to its expiration on march  pursuant to the march  one year management agreement extension  such incentive fee was based on of earnings calculated in accordance with gaap of the company 
for purposes of the incentive compensation calculation  equity is generally defined as proceeds from issuance of common stock before underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs of issuance 
for purposes of calculating the incentive fee during  the cumulative transition adjustment of  resulting from the company s adoption of sfas no 
was excluded from earnings in its entirety and included using an amortization period of three years 
the company incurred  and  in incentive compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no incentive fee due to the manager for the twelve months ended december  the company pays the manager an annual base management fee equal to a percentage of the average invested assets of the company as defined in the management agreement 
the base management fee is equal to per annum of the average invested assets rated less than bb or not rated  of average invested assets rated bb to bb  and of average invested assets rated above bb 
during the third quarter of  the manager agreed to reduce the management fees by from its calculated amount for the third and fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this revision resulted in  in savings to the company during the company incurred   and  in base management fees in accordance with the terms of the management agreement for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in accordance with the provisions of the management agreement  the company recorded reimbursements to the manager of   and for certain expenses incurred on behalf of the company during   and  respectively 
the company has an administration agreement with the manager 
under the terms of the administration agreement  the manager provides financial reporting  audit coordination and accounting oversight services to the company 
the agreement can be cancelled upon day written notice by either party 
the company pays the manager a monthly administrative fee at an annual rate of of the first million of average net assets  of the next million of average net assets and of average net assets in excess of million subject to a minimum annual fee of for the years ended december    and  the company paid administration fees of   and  respectively 
the special servicer on seven of the company s nine controlling class trusts is midland loan services  inc midland  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of pnc bank 
the company s fees for midland s services are at market rates 
in march  the company purchased twelve certificates each representing a interest in different classes of owner trust ns i trust owner trusts for an aggregate investment of  these certificates were purchased from pnc bank 
the assets of the owner trusts consist of commercial mortgage loans originated or acquired by an affiliate of pnc bank 
the company entered into a  committed line of credit from pnc funding corp 
to borrow up to of the fair market value of the company s interest in the owner trusts 
outstanding borrowings against this line of credit bear interest at a libor based variable rate 
as of december   there was  borrowed under this line of credit 
the company earned  from the owner trusts and paid interest of approximately to pnc funding corp 
as interest on borrowings under a related line of credit for year ended december  during  the company sold four owner trusts 
the gain on the sale of those owner trusts was the outstanding borrowings were repaid prior to the expiration of the line of credit on march   at which time the remaining owner trusts were sold at a gain of the company has entered into a million commitment to acquire shares in carbon  a private commercial real estate income opportunity fund managed by the manager 
the period during which the company may be required to purchase shares under the commitment expires in july the company does not incur any additional management or incentive fees to the manager as a result of its investment in carbon 
on december   the company owned of the outstanding shares in carbon 
the company s remaining commitment at december  was  reit status the company has elected to be taxed as a reit and therefore must comply with the provisions of the code with respect thereto 
accordingly  the company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset  income  and stock ownership tests are met 
the company may  however  be subject to tax at corporate rates or at excise tax rates on net income or capital gains not distributed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit curve risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the market value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the market value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the market value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the market value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
as of december   all of the company s liabilities outside of the cdos are floating rate based on a market spread to libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or increased costs 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk based on a method that takes into consideration the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities  including its preferred stock 
the company s objective is to acquire assets and match fund the purchase so that interest rate risk associated with financing these assets is reduced or eliminated 
the primary risks associated with acquiring and financing these assets are mark to market risk and short term rate risk 
examples of these financing types include day repurchase agreements and committed borrowing facilities 
certain secured financing arrangements provide for an advance rate based upon a percentage of the market value of the asset being financed 
market movements that cause asset values to decline would require a margin call or a cash payment to maintain the relationship between asset value and amount borrowed 
a cash flow based cdo is an example of a secured financing vehicle that does not require a mark to market to establish or maintain a level of financing 
when financed assets are subject to a mark to market margin call  the company carefully monitors the interest rate sensitivity of those assets 
the duration of the assets financed which are subject to a mark to market margin call was years based on reported gaap book value as of december  the company s reported book value incorporates the market value of the company s interest bearing assets but it does not incorporate the market value of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
the fixed rate interest bearing liabilities and preferred stock will generally reduce the actual interest rate risk of the company from a pure economic perspective even though changes in the value of these liabilities are not reflected in the company s book value 
the fixed rate liabilities issued in cdo i and cdo ii reduce the company s economic duration by approximately years 
the series c preferred stock reduces the company s economic duration by approximately year 
the company s reported book value is not reduced by these liabilities and therefore is approximately years longer than the economic duration 
the company s duration management strategy focuses on the economic risk and maintains economic duration within a band of to years 
at december   economic duration was years 
earnings per share is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor curve  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
market value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant even though changes in both long and short term interest rates can occur simultaneously 
regarding the table below  all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in earnings per share given libor movements change in libor  projected change in basis points earnings per share base case credit risk the company s portfolios of commercial real estate assets are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
before acquiring a controlling class security  the company will perform an analysis of the quality of all of the loans proposed 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles are either removed from the proposed pool or the company receives a price adjustment 
the company underwrites its controlling class cmbs investments assuming the underlying loans will suffer a certain dollar amount of defaults and these defaults will lead to some level of realized losses 
loss adjusted yields are computed based on these assumptions and applied to each class of security supported by the cash flow on the underlying loans 
the most significant variables affecting loss adjusted yields include  but are not limited to  the number of defaults  the severity of loss that occurs subsequent to a default and the timing of the actual loss 
the different rating levels of cmbs will react differently to changes in these assumptions 
the lowest rated securities b or lower are generally more sensitive to changes in timing of actual losses 
the higher rated securities b or higher are more sensitive to the severity of losses 
the company generally assumes that all of the principal of a non rated security and a significant portion  if not all  of ccc and a portion of b rated securities will not be recoverable over time 
the loss adjusted yields of these classes reflect that assumption  therefore  the timing of when the total loss of principal occurs is the most important assumption in determining value 
the interest coupon generated by a security will cease when there is a total loss of its principal regardless of whether that principal is paid 
therefore  timing is of paramount importance because the longer the principal balance remains outstanding  the more interest coupon the holder receives  which results in a larger economic return 
alternatively  if principal is lost faster than originally assumed  there is less opportunity to receive interest coupon  which results in a lower or possibly negative return 
additional losses which occur due to greater severity will not have a significant effect as all principal is already assumed to be non recoverable 
if actual principal losses on the underlying loans exceed assumptions  the higher rated securities will be affected more significantly as a loss of principal may not have been assumed 
the company generally assumes that all principal will be recovered by classes rated b or higher 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions and careful monitoring of loan performance 
after the securities have been acquired  the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or acceleration of the timing of an expected loss will cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company 
furthermore  the company may be required to write down a portion of the adjusted purchase price of the affected assets through its consolidated statements of financial condition 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s controlling class cmbs  without a significant acceleration of those losses  would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per share of common stock per year and cause a significant write down at the time the loss assumption is changed 
the amount of the write down depends on several factors  including which securities are most affected at the time of the write down  but is estimated to be in the range of to per share based on a doubling of expected losses 
a significant acceleration of the timing of these losses would cause the company s net income to decrease 
the company s exposure to a write down is mitigated by the fact that most of these assets are financed on a non recourse basis in the company s cdos  where a significant portion of the risk of loss is transferred to the cdo bondholders 
as of december   securities with a total market value of  are collateralizing the cdo borrowings of  therefore  the company s residual interest in the two cdos is  per share 
the cdo borrowings are not marked to market in accordance with gaap even though their economic value will change in response to changes in interest rates and or credit spreads 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the company s objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category
