item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company has developed criteria for determining whether a shipment should be recorded as a sale or as a deferred sale a balance sheet liability 
the criteria for recording a cod sale  or payments prior to shipment sale or sale financed through third party floor plan arrangements  are that the boat has been completed and shipped to a dealer or to the government  that title has passed to the dealer or to the government  and that there is no direct commitment to repurchase the boat or to pay floor plan interest beyond the sales program terms 
as described more fully below at business environment  most of the company s shipments to dealers were financed through floor plan arrangements with third party lenders pursuant to which the company is subject to repurchase boats repossessed by the third party lenders if the dealer defaults under his credit arrangement 
the company has no repurchase liability for the balance of shipments 
this is the method of sales recognition believed to be in use by most boat manufacturers 
at june    and  there were no commitments to dealers to pay the interest on floor plan financed boats in excess of the time period specified in the company s written sales program and there were no direct repurchase agreements 
there were no deferred sales or cost of sales estimated at june    and the company has a contingent liability to repurchase boats where it participates in the floor plan financing made available to its dealers by third party finance companies 
this liability amounted to approximately   and  at june    and  respectively 
sales to participating dealers are approved by the respective finance companies 
if a participating dealer does not satisfy its obligation to the lender and the boat is subsequently repossessed by the lender  then the company may be required to repurchase the boat

at june  and the reserve was  on july  the company obtained an  long term loan from bank of america that was guaranteed by brunswick  a division of which supplies marine engines used in the company s products 
proceeds from the loan were used to refinance existing long term debt  pay current liabilities  and provide additional working capital funds

current tax expense is and for the years ended june  and and a benefit of  for the year ended june  deferred tax expense is for the year ended june  and  and  at june  and current tax expense for the year ended june  results 
table of contents from the net operating loss carryover from the year ended june  there remains approximately  for federal and  for state tax purposes of net operating loss carryovers available till the years and  respectively  to offset current tax expenses 
the deferred tax charge for the year ended june  resulted from changes to the various temporary timing differences between book and tax as outlined in note to the financial statements 
the ultimate realization of the benefits from the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s future earnings  the future tax laws in effect  and other unknown factors  all of which are uncertain 
for these reasons and because the company has generated operating tax losses in recent years  the company has elected to provide for a tax asset valuation allowance of  at june  and  at june  management is of the opinion the tax asset valuation allowance will not be required in its entirety in the coming years 
management estimates  based on the company s increased backlog of orders  that sales volumes will continue to improve in the near future thus resulting in improved earnings and partial absorption of the net operating tax loss carryovers 
however  at this time the company has chosen not to reduce the tax asset valuation allowance for the following reasons with the exception of order backlog  it is very difficult to predict future sales volumes in an uncertain economy that exists at the present time  and the company s inconsistent earnings history in recent years  which includes significant losses in fiscal and currently  the tax asset valuation allowance is adjusted to the extent that total deferred tax assets exceed total deferred tax liabilities 
as operating results and the economy stabilize and future sales volumes increase  consideration will be given to reducing or eliminating the valuation allowance

management is of the opinion that cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy its current and future liquidity demands because of the increase in sales volumes and sales backlogs at the date of this filing 
additionally the company has maintained a historical sales backlog through the date of this report 
effects of inflation 
the company has not been materially affected by the moderate inflation of recent years 
since most of the company s plant and its equipment are relatively new  expenditures for replacements are not expected to be a factor in the near term future 
when raw material costs increase because of inflation  the company attempts to minimize the effect of these increases by using alternative  less costly materials  or by finding less costly sources for the materials it uses 
when the foregoing measures are not possible  selling prices are increased to recover the cost increases 

table of contents the company s products are targeted at the segment of the powerboat market where retail purchasers are generally less significantly affected by price or other economic conditions 
consequently  management believes that the impact of inflation on sales and the results of operations will not be material
