see forward looking statements 
general the company produces and markets fresh and frozen baked breads  rolls and snack foods 
sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using private label products to control overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 

table of contents on april   the company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert business to schwan 
the company retained the frozen bread and roll portion of the mrs 
smith s bakeries business 
as a result  the frozen bread and roll business as well as the birmingham  alabama production facility  formerly a part of flowers bakeries  became a part of our flowers snack segment  with flowers snack being renamed flowers specialty 
for purposes of this form k  discussion will relate to our flowers bakeries and flowers specialty business units as such businesses are currently operated 
the frozen dessert business of mrs 
smith s bakeries that was sold is reported as a discontinued operation 
because the mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert and frozen bread and roll businesses historically shared certain administrative and division expenses  certain allocations and assumptions have been made in order to present historical comparative information 
in most instances  administrative and division expenses have been allocated between mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers specialty based on cases of product sold 
management believes that the amounts are reasonable estimations of the costs that would have been incurred had the mrs 
smith s bakeries frozen dessert and frozen bread and rolls businesses performed these functions as separate divisions 
the principal elements comprising the company s production costs are ingredients  packaging materials  labor and overhead 
the major ingredients used in the production of the company s products are flour  sugar  shortening and dairy products 
the company also uses paper products  such as corrugated cardboard and plastic to package its products 
the prices of these materials are subject to significant volatility 
the company has mitigated the effects of such price volatility in the past through its hedging programs  but may not be successful in protecting itself from fluctuations in the future 
in addition to the foregoing factors  production costs are affected by the efficiency of production methods and capacity utilization 
the company s selling  marketing and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of distribution  logistics and advertising expenses 
distribution and logistics costs represent the largest component of the company s cost structure  other than production costs  and are principally influenced by changes in sales volume 
additionally  the independent distributors receive a percentage of the wholesale price of sales to retailers and other customers 
the company records these amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the company are comprised of depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of certain costs in excess of net tangible assets associated with acquisitions 
the company does not allocate depreciation and amortization to cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  
table of contents derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  self insurance reserves deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives  at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has utilized scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to in the industry as pay by scan pbs 
during  the industry saw a sharp increase in the use of scan based trading 
in response to this demand  the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and is aggressively working with its larger customers  such as wal mart  winn dixie  kroger and food lion  to expand the use of pbs 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million in sales through pbs 
the company estimates that by the end of fiscal  it will have approximately million in pbs sales 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payment by our customers 
while the company believes its current allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to the commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
the company may from time to time enter into contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under gaap 
these contracts must  under gaap  be marked to market as of the end of each quarter  which may result in significant volatility in our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 

table of contents self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its defined benefit plan based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plan portfolio  past performance of these assets and other factors 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
there are no new participants in the company s defined benefit plan as participation was frozen as of december  the company s fiscal pension expense was million 
the company expects its fiscal pension expense to be approximately million 
a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return would impact the company s fiscal pension expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company uses rates of return on high quality fixed income investments  such as those included in the moody s aa bond index  to select its discount rate 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company evaluates input from its investment advisors and actuaries in light of the plan assets historical actual returns and current economic conditions 
the average annual return on the plan assets for the last years is approximately net of investment expenses 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  debt securities  other diversifying strategies includes  but not limited to  absolute return funds  real estate  cash and other 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company includes an explicit investment management expense assumption in its calculation of annual pension cost 
therefore  the return on asset rate reflects long term expected returns before investment expenses 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all its plan assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the estimated average future service of plan participants 
the total unrealized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for all of the pension plans the company sponsors was million  an amount that did not exceed i or ii above 
therefore no amortization of unrealized losses 
table of contents was required during fiscal the total unrealized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for all of the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized due to plan asset performance that is below expectations or through actual experience that differs from the actuaries assumptions  then this loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company contributed million and million  respectively  to the defined benefit plan 
the value of the company s plan assets were below the accumulated benefit obligation abo at its most recent plan measurement date 
accounting rules require that  if the abo exceeds the fair value of pension plan assets  the employer must recognize a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded abo 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment that impacted other comprehensive income by million  net of income tax 
other balance sheet accounts impacted include deferred tax assets increase of million  unfunded pension liability increase of million  and an intangible asset related to unrecognized prior service costs increase of million 
future pension contributions will depend on market conditions 
the company will make cash contributions of approximately million during fiscal to the pension plan 
in assessing different scenarios  the company believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without affecting the business strategy of the company 
matters affecting analysis reporting periods 
fiscal consists of weeks  while fiscal and fiscal each consists of weeks
