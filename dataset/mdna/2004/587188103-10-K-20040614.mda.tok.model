item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
all per share amounts and shares outstanding amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two for one stock split effected january  application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue  net of discounts  returns  and rebates in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
as required by these standards  revenue is recorded when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met  and sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon the shipment of products  or in the case of consignment inventories  upon the notification of usage by the customer 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and other volume based incentives 
should the actual level of customer participation in these programs differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 
we also allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
we record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale based on historical experience  recent gross sales levels and any notification of pending returns 
should the actual returns differ from those estimated  additional adjustments to revenue and cost of sales may be required 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  canada and western europe 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers  primarily hospitals  doctors and distributors 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers  or the economy as whole  were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances for estimated losses would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost  based on the first in first out fifo cost method  or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions differ from those projected by us  additional inventory valuation adjustments may be required 
these additional valuation adjustments would be included in cost of goods sold 
warranties and related reserves we provide an accrual for the estimated cost of product warranties and product liability claims at the time revenue is recognized 
such accruals are based on estimates  which are based on relevant factors such as historical experience  the warranty period  estimated costs  levels of insurance and insurance retentions  identified product quality issues  if any  and  to a limited extent  information developed by the insurance company using actuarial techniques 
these accruals are analyzed periodically for adequacy 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  the warranty obligation is affected by reported rates of product problems and costs incurred in correcting product problems 
should actual reported problem rates or the resulting costs differ from our estimates  adjustments to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these adjustments would be included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  we evaluate goodwill on at least an annual basis 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective april  and analyzed goodwill and intangibles for impairment and no impairment were noted as a result of this analysis 
if these assumptions and their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
these impairment charges would be included in the results of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth various items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative research and development operating income interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income 
table of contents years ended march  and sales sales for fiscal increased million to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in sales occurred in both the domestic and international markets 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the stronger euro  had a favorable year to year impact on international sales of million  or approximately five percentage points of the year to year growth 
we expect total sales to increase in fiscal at a low double digit rate over sales in fiscal sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of breast implant products increased to million from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase in breast implant products is attributable to organic growth in unit sales of our breast implants and associated products and approximately million is the result of a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
sales of body contouring products increased to million from million in the prior year 
an increase in body contouring product sales is primarily attributable to increased liposuction procedural volumes  as awareness and acceptance of this procedure increases 
in addition  other product sales increased million primarily attributable to our acquisition of inform solutions and ancillary product sales 
sales of surgical urology products increased to million from million in the prior year 
increases in sales of pelvic floor products and disposable urinary care products  along with a favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements of million were partially offset by a million decrease in penile implant sales and a million decrease in brachytherapy product sales from the prior year 
sales of pelvic floor products increased to million from million in the prior year primarily due to the introduction of the obtape sling to the us market in august and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
sales of disposable urinary care and other products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily a result of the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
sales of penile implant products for the year decreased to million from million in the prior year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we restructured our domestic urology sales force and provided cross training across the full range of our urology product line  which we believe attributed to a short term negative impact on our penile implant product sales 
in addition  we believe sales were also negatively impacted by the recent introduction of new drug therapies for erectile dysfunction in the us brachytherapy sales decreased million to million from million  a decrease of from the prior year 
this decrease is a result of several factors 
on january   our exclusive distribution and supply agreement with nasi  which was our sole source of iodine and palladium seeds  expired resulting in an interruption of our supply of seeds 
on february   we completed our acquisition of mills biopharmaceuticals  inc and began supplying our customers with iodine seeds manufactured by mills 
in addition  we reached a nonexclusive one year agreement with best medical  inc best to distribute best palladium brachytherapy seeds 
however  due to best s difficulties in increasing manufacturing capacity in a short time frame  and our inability to secure sufficient new vendor supply of palladium brachytherapy seeds  we were unable to fill all customer orders 
in addition  alternative procedures  changes in medicare reimbursement  and additional competitive pressures have decreased procedural volumes and decreased average selling prices of our brachytherapy products 
these market factors and supply interruptions resulted in lost sales of approximately million per quarter for the first three quarters of fiscal and lost sales of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
we do not expect supply interruptions to affect fiscal sales  however  it is unclear how the other market factors will affect future sales 
sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales growth was generally aided by the effect of the stronger euro as nearly half of these product sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar  this effect was approximately million for the segment 
the remainder of the growth is attributable to recent direct to consumer advertising  and the introduction of the self cath plus lubricious catheter in fiscal  which positively impacted unit sales 
sales of intermittent catheters increased  or million to million  and were partially offset by a decrease of  or million in sales of male external catheters as compared in the prior year 
the decrease in male external catheter sales is primarily attributable to the timing of distributor purchases  and future sales are expected to increase at market rates of growth 
sales of other disposable healthcare and ostomy products increased to million from million in the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements and unit volume growth 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales for fiscal was of net sales  compared to in fiscal cost of sales for the aesthetic and general surgery products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to efficiencies of scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas facility  partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies at our new manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
cost of sales for surgical urology products decreased to from of net sales  primarily due to the decrease in brachytherapy sales which have a lower margin than other surgical urology products and the vertical integration of our subsidiary  mills biopharmaceuticals  as the manufacturer of our own iodine brachytherapy seeds 
cost of sales for clinical and consumer healthcare products decreased to from of net sales in the prior year  primarily due to product mix shift towards higher margin products and manufacturing efficiencies in our minnesota facility 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal approximately million of the increase reflects the effect of foreign currency rate movements  primarily the stronger euro 
we had generally higher levels of expenses at our foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries of approximately million and new general and administrative expenses at recently acquired subsidiaries of approximately million 
we are in the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning erp system 
as a result  certain non capitalizable expenses  training costs  depreciation and start up inefficiencies contributed to higher levels of expenses 
these costs were approximately million of which million is expected to be ongoing 
selling and marketing expenses included approximately million of additional expenses related to the reorganization of the urology sales forces for cross training and costs related to a reduction in the number of employees 
the balance of the increase is generally related to higher levels of selling and marketing efforts 
research and development research and development expenses in fiscal increased million to million and to of net sales from in fiscal approximately million of the increase was attributable to the aesthetic and general surgery segment and was primarily due to increased activity in our breast implant studies to support our gel implant pma  increased patient volume in our adjunct study and our recent acquisition of a life ltd which is developing hyaluronic acid based soft tissue filler for aesthetic facial applications 
the remaining increase of million is attributable to our ongoing development activities in our surgical urology segment and the development of automated manufacturing technologies  and development expenses related to brachytherapy seeds 
our gel implant pma was filed with the fda in december and we are in the process of amending our application to meet new draft guidance for saline  silicone gel  and alternative breast implants released by the fda 
we expect to begin new clinical and laboratory studies in the near future for our newly licensed botulinum toxin and our recently acquired hyaluronic acid products for facial applications 
in addition  we are committed to a variety of clinical and laboratory studies in connection with our gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 
interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal interest expense includes interest on our foreign lines of credit and imputed interest on long term liabilities recorded at net present value related to certain acquisitions of assets during fiscal and in december  we issued convertible subordinated notes totaling million 
interest expense for fiscal includes four months of accrued interest payable and amortization of bond issue costs 
the increase in interest expense is attributable to the interest on these notes  partially offset by lower rates of interest  lower levels of borrowings on our operating lines and decreased levels of imputed interest on acquisition liabilities 
we expect that interest expense related to the convertible notes will be approximately million in fiscal year interest income decreased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the decrease is due to lower prevailing interest rates on short term investments  partially offset by higher levels of cash balances available for investment 

table of contents other income  net primarily includes gains or losses on sales of marketable securities and foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations 
other income  net increased to million from million in the prior year 
this increase was the result of the favorable impact of the euro s relative strength compared to the us dollar  partially offset by a decrease in realized and unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio of marketable securities 
during fiscal we recorded a one time pre tax impairment charge of  related to our investment in paradigm medical 
also in fiscal  we sold our remaining investment in nasi and we recorded a pre tax gain of  income taxes our effective rate of corporate income taxes was in fiscal year  an increase of of pretax income from the rate in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate represents a return to our historic effective tax rate  as the prior year s rates reflected refunds received in the third quarter of fiscal year related to the amendment of tax returns for our foreign sales corporation 
net income and earnings per share net income in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal earnings per share was per share in both fiscal and diluted earnings per share was per diluted share in both fiscal and the effect of lower net income in fiscal was offset by the positive impact of fewer shares outstanding due to our stock repurchase program 
increased sales and lower cost of goods sold in fiscal were offset by higher operating expenses  which resulted in a decrease in operating income 
fiscal net income was partially impacted by a slightly higher effective tax rate compared to fiscal we expect earnings per share for fiscal to increase at a mid teen percentage rate over earnings per share in fiscal years ended march  and sales sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of 
included in fiscal sales are eleven months of clinical and consumer healthcare product sales relating to our may acquisition of the urology and ostomy business of portex ltd 
sales of products acquired in the portex transaction accounted for five percentage points of the year to year growth 
the increase in sales was in both domestic and international markets 
foreign exchange rate movements  primarily the stronger euro  had a favorable year to year impact on international sales of million  or approximately four percentage points of the year to year growth 
sales of aesthetic and general surgery products increased to million from million in the prior year 
total sales of breast implants products increased to million from million in the prior year 
sales of body contouring products increased million or over the prior year 
we believe that sales growth was primarily attributable to strong product demand both domestically and internationally  the introduction of an improved tissue expander in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a resurgence of demand including surgeries that were postponed after the events of september th and the benefit from the effect of the strong euro 
sales of surgical urology products increased to million from million in the prior year 
the growth primarily resulted from strong sales of products acquired in our february acquisition of porges sa  product sales and the effect of a stronger euro 
penile implant sales increased million  due in part to incremental sales from the titan inflatable device introduced in the third quarter of fiscal and marketing program efforts to increase consumer awareness 
sales of pelvic floor reconstruction products increased million due to new product introductions late in fiscal brachytherapy sales decreased million  or  from the prior year as unit sales increases were partially offset as competitive pressures decreased average selling prices 
in addition  interruption of our supply of palladium radioactive seeds due to the expiration of our exclusive distribution agreement with nasi and difficulties in securing new vendor supply to fulfill customer orders resulted in lost sales  and these difficulties have continued into fiscal 
table of contents sales of clinical and consumer healthcare products increased to million from million in the prior year 
this growth primarily resulted from our may acquisition of the urology and ostomy businesses of portex ltd  whose product sales are included for eleven months of fiscal and accounted for approximately million of the sales growth over fiscal sales growth was generally aided by the effect of the stronger euro as nearly half of these product sales are invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  sales of male external catheters grew  primarily in international markets  offsetting a slight decline in sales of other healthcare products 
sales of intermittent self catheters increased following the introduction of the self cath plus lubricious catheter in fiscal cost of sales cost of sales was of net sales for fiscal  compared to in fiscal cost of sales for the aesthetic and general surgery products decreased from of net sales to  primarily due to efficiencies of scale and improved manufacturing efficiencies at our texas facility  partially offset by startup costs at our new manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
cost of sales for surgical urology products decreased from of net sales to primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and the recent acquisition of mills biopharmaceuticals  inc  to manufacture our own iodine brachytherapy seeds 
cost of sales for clinical and consumer healthcare products increased from of net sales to primarily due to the may acquisition of the urology and ostomy businesses of portex  whose products have lower margins than our previously existing products 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were of net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales reflect efficiencies of scale as selling  general and administrative costs grew at rates slower than overall revenue growth 
these economies of scale were offset slightly by the non recurring general and administrative expenses associated with the recent acquisition of the urology and ostomy business of portex and non capitalizable expenses related to the implementation of information technology systems to modernize and integrate recent acquisitions 
research and development research and development expenses were of net sales in fiscal  a slight decrease from in fiscal overall spending on research and development increased by from the prior year 
the decrease in research and development as a percentage of net sales is partially attributable to several recent acquisitions and associated revenue growth in the clinical and consumer healthcare segment 
this segment has a generally lower level of research and development spending on new product development than the long term implantable products in the aesthetics and surgical urology segments 
fiscal development costs relate primarily to our clinical studies and accelerated product enhancement projects for existing products and new product development 
although we have successfully completed several pre market approval application submissions related to mammary and penile implants in recent years  the amount of spending on research and development is not expected to decrease as the focus of our research and development efforts shifts towards product enhancements and new product development 
in addition  we are committed to several post fda approval follow up studies  and a variety of clinical and laboratory studies in connection with our gel filled and saline filled mammary implants and other products 

table of contents interest and other income and expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal  from thousand in fiscal in january  we acquired the assets of south bay medical llc 
approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as a long term accrued liability at net present value 
in december  we recorded an additional million of long term accrued liability at net present value related to the acquisition of certain intangible rights from prosurg  inc  inc 
imputed interest on these liabilities is charged to interest expense 
this imputed interest and balances outstanding on several lines of credit established to facilitate operating cash flow needs at our foreign subsidiaries  slightly offset by lower prevailing borrowing rates of interest  accounted for the increase in interest expense over the prior year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is due to higher cash and marketable security balances partially offset by lower prevailing interest rates on short term investments and a change in our investment strategy 
our investment strategy involves a shift to taxable money market investments which have a higher pretax yield  from tax free municipal bonds and similar tax advantaged investment vehicles  which have a lower pre tax yield 
other income  net primarily include gains or losses on sales of marketable securities  disposal of assets  foreign currency gains or losses related to our foreign operations and impairment charges on long term investments

income taxes the effective rate of corporate income taxes was for both fiscal and fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from historical levels is a result of a higher proportion of income from foreign operations with lower tax rates and tax refunds received in the first and second quarters of fiscal year related to the amendment of tax returns for our foreign sales corporation 
as a result these tax refunds  the tax rate for the first half of fiscal was whereas the tax rate in the second half of fiscal was 
net income net income for fiscal was million  compared to million for the previous year  an increase of million or 
increased sales  primarily of aesthetics products  lower cost of goods sold and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  and a tax refund increased net income  while the write down of our investment in paradigm reduced net income

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations lines of credit acquisition and other milestones other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total the nature of our business creates a need to enter into purchase obligations with suppliers 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
inventory related and other purchase obligations do not exceed our projected requirements over the normal course of business 
we enter into various product and intellectual property acquisitions and business combinations 
in connection with some of these activities  we agree to make payments to third parties when specific milestones are achieved  such as receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations are dependent on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
our principal source of liquidity at march  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  plus million available under our existing lines of credit 
we believe that funds generated from operations  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and funds available under our line of credit agreements will be adequate to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditure investment requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance unforeseen requirements or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies through the sale of equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
there is no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms that would be favorable to us  or at all 
if funds are raised by issuing additional equity securities or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentage of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  equity or debt securities issued by us may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 

table of contents forward looking statements certain words in this report like believe  intend  anticipate  expect  estimate  seek  project  plan  will  and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results 
such factors which may affect forward looking statements include  among others  the following significant product liability  warranty claims  or other claims  errors in estimates  assumptions and judgments used in accounting  non compliance with fda and other regulatory agencies  inadequate reimbursement by government agencies and others for our products  difficulties implementing and integrating new information technologies systems  and other factors outlined in our previously filed public documents  copies of which may be obtained without cost from us 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place too much weight on such statements 
we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risks involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not use derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we maintain a portfolio of highly liquid cash equivalents  with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
we also have current marketable securities  consisting primarily of money market mutual funds  us  state and municipal bonds  and commercial paper that are of limited credit risk and have contractual maturities of less than two years 
given the short term nature of these investments  we are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
we have long term marketable securities and investments which includes investments in federal home loan bank and federal mortgage association bonds with maturities of two to five years 
we do not expect to experience any material impact upon our results of operation as a result of changes to interest rates related to these investments 
on december   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due january  pursuant to rule a under the securities act of the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
our subsidiaries also maintain certain levels of variable rate debt such as operating lines of credit 
the majority of our debt carries a fixed rate percentage and therefore is not subject to significant interest rate risk 
a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition related to the variable rate debt described 

table of contents exchange rate risk a portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign markets 
we manufacture our products primarily in the united states and europe and sell them outside the us through a combination of international distributors and wholly owned sales offices 
sales to third party distributors and to the wholly owned sales offices are transacted in us dollars  euros  british pounds  and canadian dollars 
our foreign sales offices primarily invoice customers in their local currency 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets mentioned 
the principal risk exposure we face results from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates 
we experience transactional exchange rate risk when one of our subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
in the last two fiscal years the effect of exchange rate risk has been favorable upon our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently hedge any of the foreign exchange rate exposures 
a significant and rapid change in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations
