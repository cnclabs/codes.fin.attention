item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview business conditions in the industry for internet advertising services continue to be characterized by stronger global demand  particularly in asia 
continuing improvement in the overall economy has led many advertisers to increase their advertising spending generally and to increase their spending on internet advertising 
in general  advertisers appear to recognize that increased global internet connectivity and broadband usage and a trend toward internet use and away from other media consumption indicate growing online audiences of consumers 
as online audiences grow  web publishers and advertisers also appear to be focusing more on the benefits of using technology solutions to help them reach  target and manage audiences on web sites 
accordingly  in light of these trends  we continue to expect improvement in business conditions in the internet advertising services sector for the upcoming fiscal year and we are approaching fiscal with optimism 
we offer a comprehensive suite of media and technology products for the online advertising needs of web publishers and advertisers  including web representation  advertisement serving  analytics and search paid inclusion 
our web alliance of over affiliated web sites aggregates advertising inventory online and targets audience segments to attract advertisers worldwide 
our open adsystem technology helps web publishers and advertisers target  convert and retain online customers  maintain customer relationships and safeguard the privacy of web users 
through search  we connect advertisers with consumers who use search engines to find information about products and services 
we were formed through the combination of media  inc and real media  inc in media  our legal and accounting predecessor  has been publicly traded since august real media was a privately held company that developed the first generation of our open adstream software and operated small advertising networks in the united states and europe 
following the downturn in the global economy and  in particular  the correction in the internet market  we executed a strategic plan to restructure our operations  focusing on our core businesses  including integrated media solutions and internet advertising delivery and management technology  and exiting non core businesses including online promotions and e mail marketing 
as a result  we divested non core assets  including ipromotions  an online promotions business  exactis  an e mail business  imake  a broadband convergence technology business  awardtrack  an online promotions and purchase rewards business  and sabela  an advertisment serving technology business 
we also acquired strategic assets including insight first  a web analytics provider  and  recently  real media korea co 
ltd  a provider of media and technology solutions 
the foregoing acquisitions and dispositions may affect the comparability of our results from period to period 
we generate revenue in two business segments integrated media solutions and technology solutions 
integrated media solutions our integrated media solutions consist of the web alliance  a global alliance of web sites represented by us through which advertisers can run campaign orders directly with us  search  an internet search marketing service designed to connect advertisers with consumers using search engines to find product information and other media services 
our search solution uses proprietary technology to help advertisers determine the keywords most relevant to their products and services in order to lead users from search engines to the advertisers web sites 
we generate revenue through the web alliance from fees paid by client advertisers 
we typically offer advertisers a pricing model based on cost per thousand impressions cpm enabling a client advertiser to pay a fee based on the number of times its advertisement is viewed 
we share the revenue generated through the web alliance with web publishers included in the web alliance 
with respect to our network  a network of hundreds of web sites offering a variety of content  we generally retain between and of revenues from advertisers depending on  among other things  a web publisher s audience size  the number of unique visitors  impressions and page views  and the prominence of the web publisher s brand name 
with respect to our portfolio  a select portfolio of brand name web sites  and our verticals  a network of web sites categorized by content demographic and psychographic characteristics  we generally retain between and depending on similar factors 
the following table shows by quarter the number of paid impressions and the average cpm since january  metrics prior to are not comparable due to the acquisition of real media 
number of paid impressions in billions average cpm q q q q q q q q search provides a paid inclusion service for advertisers  which consists of producing an editorially reviewed search listing that appears prominently in search results displayed by our partner search engine distribution partners in response to a user s inquiry for particular keywords and phrases 
we assist our client advertisers in selecting keywords and phrases most relevant to their products or services and the most relevant web site landing pages to which visitors will be directed in order to increase the percentage of visitors that are converted into buyers 
we submit the search listing to our search engine distribution partners through frequently refreshed data feeds 
our client advertisers pay only for valid visitors to their landing pages 
we generate revenue through search from performance based pricing models that generally feature cost per click cpc pricing  whereby an advertiser pays us a fee for each user or valid visitor delivered to their web sites from our search engine distribution partners 
we share the revenue generated by our search services with our search engine distribution partners that have provided their paid search listings to us based upon either a percentage of revenue or fees paid per bid 
we generally retain between and depending on  among other things  the size of our distribution partner  the number of valid visitors  the number of searches conducted and the prominence of our distribution partner s brand name 
for bid based arrangements  we place bids for various key words and phrases with our search engine distribution partners in order to acquire valid visitors which are then routed to our client advertisers web sites 
search had approximately  active client advertisers accounts at december  the following table shows by quarter the number of valid visitors and the average cpc for search since january  number of valid visitors in millions average cpc q q q q q q q q our other media services primarily relate to e mail list rental 
we derive revenue from this service by delivering advertisements to e mail lists for advertisers  who pay based on a cpm basis 
our revenue share with list providers generally ranges between and 
technology solutions our technology solutions are primarily based on our patent protected open adsystem technology platform for internet advertisement delivery  management and analytics  and consist of open adstream local  which we license to web publishers to run on their proprietary  local servers  open adstream central  which we provide to web publishers from software hosted centrally on our servers  and open advertiser  which we provide to advertisers and advertising agencies from software hosted centrally on our servers 
we designed our insight software solutions to fully integrate with our open adsystem technology to offer web publishers active campaign reporting and marketing intelligence and help advertisers measure  analyze and manage online audiences 
in addition to our insight xe solution  which is currently available  we expect to commercially launch two more analytics products in the first half of that will integrate with oas 
we have designed our insight act solution to enable a web publisher to enhance the value of its advertising inventory by identifying and targeting segments of its audience who may be receptive to a specific advertiser s message 
we have designed our insight se solution to allow an advertiser to create targeted campaigns using keywords and phrases  and generate performance metrics that track visitors from specific search engines throughout the entire sales cycle  from prospecting by new customers to the final sale 
we may provide these solutions  including insight xe  to our customers from software hosted on our servers or from software hosted on a customer s server that is administrated by us 
we generate revenue from licensing our open adstream local software to web publishers 
our license agreements typically provide for an upfront license fee and a software maintenance and service fee 
we negotiate license fees based on  among other things  the forecasted number of impressions a web publisher will deliver using our software and several other factors 
we generate revenue from our open adstream central and open advertiser services from fees paid by web publishers and advertisers and agencies  respectively 
we typically offer web publishers or advertisers a cpm based pricing model allowing the web publisher or advertiser to pay us based on advertising impressions 
for these customers  an impression includes the delivery by us at their request of any advertising material 
our service revenue is determined by multiplying the cpm rate by the number of impressions delivered and is typically billed on a monthly basis 
we have been generating revenue from open advertiser in europe since mid we launched our open advertiser service in the united states in june but we have not generated significant revenue in the us from this service from our initial beta or commercial customers 
we generate revenue from our insight xe solution from fees paid by web publishers 
we typically offer web publishers page view pricing enabling them to pay us based on how many page views are measured 
our revenue is calculated by multiplying the cpm rate by the number of page views delivered 
the following table shows by quarter certain metrics for our technology solutions since we believe that metrics for periods prior to are not comparable because our technology solutions then included a different product mix 
oas central  oad and insight xe oas local number of active client contracts number of active client contracts number of paid impressions in billions annual revenue per contract q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  a client contract may represent multiple clients and web sites utilizing open adstream products and services 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenue by providing professional services charged at an hourly rate and from fees paid by web publishers for trafficking their advertisements 
trafficking advertisements refers to entering advertisement creative material and campaign specifications into our open adstream software engine 
patent licensing program we have taken steps to develop a patent licensing program involving all of our patented intellectual property 
our patent program includes identifying  notifying and pursuing commercial discussions with companies that we believe practice one or more of our patents 
with any of these companies we may discuss transactions involving licensing our patents  buying our patents or jointly developing technology using our patents 
in addition  in appropriate circumstances  we will commence enforcement actions against companies that infringe our patents 
our patent license arrangements are designed to include an upfront license fee and a running royalty payable by the licensee for the remaining term of the licensed patents 
in addition to doubleclick  valueclick  and advertising 
com  our initial licensees who each made one time payments to license our patent in connection with litigation settlements  we have licensed one or more of our patents to other companies  outside of the litigation context  who made upfront payments and are obligated to pay recurring royalties 
however  if we become engaged in patent litigation  any ruling against us  and  in particular  an adverse ruling in our current litigation with aquantive  could make it very difficult to license our patents or generate any license revenue 
see business legal proceedings and risk factors we depend on proprietary rights  and we face the risk of infringement 
critical accounting policies use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgment and estimates relating to matters that are inherently uncertain and may result in materially different actual results 
revenue recognition integrated media solutions web alliance revenues are generated by delivering advertising impressions for a fixed fee to third party web sites 
search revenues are derived from driving valid visitors to a client s web site 
e mail related revenues are derived from delivering advertisements to e mail lists for advertisers and web sites 
our agreements are primarily short term and we recognize revenues as services are delivered provided that no significant obligations of ours remain outstanding and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
technology solutions technology solutions revenues are derived from licensing our software  hosted advertisement serving  and software maintenance and technical support contracts 
revenue from software licensing agreements is recognized in accordance with statements of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition upon delivery of the software  which is generally when the software is made available for download  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fees to all elements of the arrangement 
at the beginning of  we refined our oas local strategy to offer customers the flexibility to adapt to rapidly changing enterprise requirements while reducing the risks and costs associated with traditional software licensing model 
we also adjusted our software arrangements and now bundle a software license with maintenance and technical support services 
as a result  we changed the revenue recognition method for oas local sales  resulting in the deferral of a portion of the oas local revenue to future periods 
using this method  the total value of the software arrangement is recognized ratably over the term of the software license 
this change modestly reduced our license fee revenue in and deferred a portion of revenue to future periods 
we will recapture the reduction in upfront license fee revenue in subsequent years as we recognize deferred revenue on these software arrangements 
under the prior arrangements  we typically recognized software license revenue immediately upon delivery of the software 
revenue from advertisement serving is recognized upon delivery 
the contracts are usually for a one year period and are billed on a monthly basis 
revenue from maintenance and technical support contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance agreements  which typically do not exceed one year 
maintenance and technical support revenue invoiced in advance of the related services is recorded as deferred revenue 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have been experienced in the past 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets 
we assess goodwill for impairment annually unless events occur that require more frequent reviews 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangibles  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
discounted cash flow analyses are used to assess nonamortizable intangible impairment while undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to assess long lived asset impairment 
if an assessment indicates impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured with discounted estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate undiscounted and discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts 
on an on going basis  management reviews the value and period of amortization or depreciation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
during this review  we re evaluate the significant assumptions used in determining the original cost of long lived assets 
although the assumptions may vary from transaction to transaction  they generally include revenue growth  operating results  cash flows and other indicators of value 
management then determines whether there has been an impairment of the value of long lived assets based upon events or circumstances that have occurred since acquisition 
the impairment policy is consistently applied in evaluating impairment for each of our wholly owned subsidiaries and investments 
investments we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
contingencies and litigation we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
restructuring activities restructuring activities in and are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
prior to  restructuring activities are accounted for in accordance with the guidance provided in the consensus opinion of the emerging issues task force eitf in connection with eitf issue eitf 
sfas no 
and eitf generally require  with respect to the recognition of severance expenses  management approval of the restructuring plan  the determination of the employees to be terminated  and communication of benefit arrangement to employees and  with respect to costs associated with lease terminations  an estimation of sublease payments

revenue was derived from three sources web alliance  search and other media services 
web alliance generated million in revenue in compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase is due to increasing the amount of paid impressions by from billion in to billion in the cost per thousand impressions declined slightly year over year primarily due to increasing the average order size  as large orders receive a lower price due to volume 
search revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this was due to an increase in the number of valid visitors delivered to our clients from million in to million in  an increase of and an increase in the costs per click that we were able to charge 
historically  we generated a significant portion of our search revenue from relationships with a small number of search engine distribution partners  particularly inktomi 
due to changes at our largest search engine distribution partner  inktomi  since its acquisition by yahoo  the revenue we generated from inktomi began to decline in the second quarter of  and our contract with inktomi expired at the end of may despite the loss of our largest distribution partner we were able to increase valid visitors by expanding our strategic relationships with other distribution partners and increasing the number of distribution partners 
cpcs have fluctuated due to the change in distribution partners 
other media services revenue was generated primarily from e mail and ipromotions 
e mail revenue decreased from million in to million in due to the sale of our us e mail management product  known as mail  to naviant on may  we maintain the ability to sell e mail domestically as a broker through mail and internationally without restriction 
in january  we sold our ipromotions unit  which accounted for million in and million in technology solutions 
our technology solutions revenue was million in and million in  an increase of 
revenue from our products that we host  including oas central  oad and insight xe  continued to grow during as impressions delivered climbed from billion in to billion in oas central continues to be an attractive solution as it requires minimal up front cost and does not require the customer to dedicate its assets to hosting the software 
in  we changed to a subscription based contract model for new customers for our oas local software 
total contract value is recognized ratably over the term of the contract whereas in the revenue related to the software license was recognized upon delivery 
had we changed contracts in  approximately million in revenue would have been deferred until future periods and reported revenue for would have been approximately million 
on this comparable basis  technology solutions revenue increased versus the prior year 
cost of revenues and gross profit integrated media solutions cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues consists primarily of fees paid to affiliates consisting of web sites for web alliance  search engine distribution partners for search  or list providers for e mail  which are usually calculated as a percentage of revenues 
web alliance cost of revenues also includes advertisement serving costs  which is an intercompany charge from the technology solutions segment based on a fixed cpm 
search cost of revenues also includes depreciation  hosting and bandwidth costs 
gross margin increased from in to in as we expanded the margin on all of our products 
the web alliance focused revenue growth on the network  which has a higher margin than the portfolio and verticals  and also benefited from the lower advertisement serving costs 
the cost of acquiring valid visitors for search increased  however  this was more than offset by price increases  declining depreciation and lower hosting and bandwidth costs 
technology solutions cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of technology solutions revenues consists of the cost of operating equipment and broadband capacity for our third party advertisement serving solutions and payroll costs to deliver and support software  offset by the portion allocated to the integrated media solutions segment for advertisement serving 
advertisement serving costs have been declining due to a reduction in the cost of space  power and bandwidth at data centers as a result of overcapacity in that industry 
adjusted for the change to a subscription based contract model for our oas local software  gross margin increased from in to in primarily due to decreased cost of advertisement serving 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of sales force salaries and commissions  advertising expenditures and costs of trade shows  conventions and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for to for as we were able to gain operating leverage off the existing cost structure 
headcount decreased from sales and marketing employees at december  to at december  the decrease in headcount was offset by an increase in commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  facilities expenses and other overhead expenses incurred to support the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in the significant decrease was due to our reductions of headcount  office space  professional fees and related expenses 
efforts to streamline operations successfully reduced headcount from general and administrative employees at december  to at december  product development expenses 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related operating expenses incurred to further enhance and maintain our advertisement serving and other technology capabilities 
we capitalized approximately million and million in costs related to developing our open advertiser product in and  respectively 
our open advertiser product was commercially launched in june we reduced our product development headcount from at december  to at december  as development efforts became more focused 
amortization of intangible assets and deferred financing 
amortization expense relates to intangible assets acquired with search in august  and certain assets of now marketing acquired in september  certain assets of insight first acquired in january and deferred financing costs associated with the subordinated convertible debenture offering in september the increase from million in to million in was due to additional transactions in offset by a full year of amortization for transactions that occurred during and prior 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of million for consists of million in contractual bonuses that will be paid in stock in lieu of cash to executives for meeting certain earnings targets  million in deferred compensation for restricted shares issued to certain employees  million in discretionary bonuses paid in stock and million in salary for certain employees who elected to received stock instead of cash 
stock based compensation of million for consists of million in stock and options grants to executives for restructuring their employment agreements  million in contractual bonuses that were paid in stock in lieu of cash to executives for meeting certain earnings targets  million in amortization of deferred compensation for restricted shares issued to certain employees  million in compensation to board members and bonuses to employees paid in stock  million in salary for employees who elected to receive stock instead of cash  and million in amortization of deferred compensation from acquisitions 
restructuring costs 
during and  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
our restructuring initiatives were to reduce employee headcount  consolidate operations and reduce office space in order to better align our sales  development and administrative organization and to position us for profitable growth consistent with our long term objectives 
the restructuring involved the involuntary termination of approximately employees and a revision of the estimate of the cost to dispose of office space at the corporate headquarters in new york 
the million charge consists of million in office closing costs and million in employee costs 
the restructuring involved the involuntary termination of approximately employees  the exiting of four offices  and a reduction of space at two offices in the fourth quarter of the million charge consists of severance of million  office closing costs of million  disposal of fixed assets of million  and other exit costs of million 
impairment of intangibles assets 
we perform on going business reviews and  based on quantitative and qualitative measures  assess the need to record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when impairment indicators are present 
where impairment indicators were identified  management determined the amount of the impairment charge by comparing the carrying values of goodwill and other long lived assets to their fair values 
in the fourth quarter of we made the strategic decision to no longer support the messenger product that was acquired with now marketing 
the related acquired technology was amortized until december  and then the remaining balance of million was considered impaired 
loss on sale of non core assets  net 
the million loss in includes a million loss on the sale of certain assets related to our us e mail management product offset by a million gain related to the sale of exactis in may interest expense  net 
interest expense relates to our notes payable and capital lease obligations and interest income relates to our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense in relates to the publigroupe debt that was settled in the second quarter of and the subordinated convertible debentures that were issued in the third quarter of interest expense in primarily related to the publigroupe loans

dividends on preferred stock 
the series a and series b preferred stock issued during the third quarter of  and the series c preferred stock issued in the second quarter of  accrue and cumulate dividends at a rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
preferred stock conversion discount 
the preferred stock conversion discounts are the result of the change in the market value of the common stock on the date of issuance and the date the conversion price was established 
when we agreed to the initial terms of the transactions with the third parties  the conversion price of the preferred stock approximated the fair value of our underlying common stock 
from the time the agreements were substantially complete until the transactions closed and all contingencies were resolved eg stockholder approval  our common stock price increased substantially and as a result  the preferred stock was issued at a substantial discount to fair market value 
in accordance with gaap  the beneficial conversion feature  calculated as the difference between market value on the date of issuance and the conversion price  is required to be expensed immediately  however  the discount was limited to the amount of cash allocable to each of the preferred stock transactions 
as a result of the difference between the conversion price and the fair value of the common stock into which the preferred stock were convertible as of the date of issuance  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million related to the series c preferred stock and million related to the series a and b preferred stock in and  respectively 
results of operations compared to factors affecting comparability of to on october   we acquired real media 
this accounted for million of revenue in the fourth quarter of  which was equally derived from the integrated media solutions and technology solutions segments 
the merger created cost synergies for our combined company  one of which was to focus on real media s proprietary open adstream technology and to abandon our existing advertisement serving technology  connect 
the transition of the web alliance business onto the open adstream platform began in december and was completed in february resulting in the elimination of redundant personnel and operating costs associated with having two advertisement serving platforms 
throughout and into  in accordance with our business plan  we acquired  divested or discontinued many of our non core assets  including in may  we completed the sale of certain technology assets and intellectual property of sabela and completed the shut down of sabela operations on june  in may  we completed the sale of exactis  our e mail service bureau 
in august  the operations of europe were shut down and our consolidated financial statements have been revised to reflect this international segment as a discontinued operation 
in january  we completed the sale of our imake subsidiary 
the financial statements of prior periods have been revised to reflect the disposition of imake as a discontinued operation 
in may  we completed the sale of certain assets related to our us e mail management product 
the revenue attributed to the disposition of these non core assets for the years ended december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively  not including approximately million in that is included as part of discontinued operations 
our technology solutions segment was not comparable between periods as the revenue in was derived solely from operations that were acquired with real media on october   while the revenue in primarily related to operations that have been sold or shut down  including exactis and sabela

revenue was derived from three sources web alliance  search and other media services 
web alliance generated million in revenue in compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due to the difficult environment for advertising  especially digital marketing  as well as a planned temporary reduction in capacity as we transitioned from the more costly connect to open adstream technology in the first quarter of in october  we acquired real media  which represented approximately million in web alliance revenue in in the beginning of  the web alliance operations of real media in the us were combined with the operations of media  so that a meaningful year over year comparison cannot be made  although the media operations of real media in the united states were not significant 
the international operations of real media for the two months that real media was included in represented approximately million of web alliance revenue  compared to the full year total of million in search revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this was due to an increase in the number of valid visitors delivered to our client web sites as a result of expanding our strategic relationship with search engine distribution partners and increasing the number of search engine distribution partners 
the average cpc per customer remained consistent year over year despite a slight trend down in the industry  however  the weighted average cpc has decreased as larger advertisers  who generally received a lower price due to volume  were providing more of the revenue 
other media services revenue was generated primarily from e mail and ipromotions 
e mail revenue decreased from million in to million in due to our strategic decision to exit the e mail business in the us we sold the us e mail management product  known as mail  to naviant on may  we maintain the ability to sell e mail domestically as a broker through mail and internationally without restriction 
in january  we sold our ipromotions unit  which accounted for million revenue in and million in technology solutions 
technology revenue of million in solely related to operations that were acquired with real media and were generated from our open adstream platform 
revenue from our products that we host  including oas central and oad  continued to grow during as impressions delivered climbed from billion in the first quarter to billion in the fourth quarter 
the million in revenue in consisted of million from exactis  which was sold in may  million from sabela  which was sold in may  and million from real media  which was acquired in october and whose results were included for two months 
cost of revenues and gross profit integrated media solutions cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consisted primarily of fees paid to affiliates  whether it is a web site for web alliance  a list provider for e mail or search engine distribution partners for search  which are usually calculated as a percentage of revenues 
cost of revenues also included depreciation of our connect advertisement serving system in and bandwidth costs 
in  the actual costs associated with advertisement serving were accounted for in the cost of revenues for the technology solutions segment which then charged the integrated media solutions segment a cpm  making these costs variable instead of fixed as they were previously accounted for when we used connect 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in margin was due to lower advertisement serving costs in as fixed costs of connect were a substantial percentage of our revenue  which had adversely affected our gross margin  additionally  the royalty percentages paid to web alliance affiliates were trending lower 
excluding the us e mail product  the margins were and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
technology solutions cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of technology revenues consisted of the cost of operating equipment and broadband capacity for our third party advertisement serving solutions and payroll costs to deliver and support software  offset by the portion allocated to the integrated media solutions segment for advertisement serving 
gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as noted above  the periods were not comparable  as the segment was comprised of almost entirely different operations 
operating expenses 
each of sales and marketing  general and administrative  product development and amortization expense decreased significantly in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of our restructuring activities  the decision to exit latin america and the sales of sabela  exactis and certain assets related to the us e mail management product 
the decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of real media 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of sales force salaries and commissions  advertising expenditures and costs of trade shows  conventions and marketing materials 
sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as a result of our rationalization efforts 
rationalization efforts decreased headcount by approximately and approximately employees were transferred to naviant  leaving approximately sales and marketing employees at december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of compensation  facilities expenses and other overhead expenses incurred to support the business 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the significant decrease was due to our reductions of headcount  office space  professional fees and related expenses 
as the economy deteriorated in  we accrued significant bad debt reserves  however  positive collection efforts in have reduced the required reserves  therefore  we enjoyed a net benefit from bad debt expense reversals for the year of approximately million 
rationalization efforts reduced headcount by approximately employees during  leaving approximately general and administrative employees at december  product development expenses 
product development expenses consisted primarily of compensation and related costs incurred to further enhance our advertisement serving and other technology capabilities 
product development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the sale of exactis on whose technology we spent significant amounts and our focus on oas which requires less enhancements than connect 
also  the expense decreased in as costs related to developing our open advertiser product were capitalized 
we capitalized approximately million during product development headcount was reduced by approximately employees during  leaving approximately at december  amortization of goodwill  intangibles and advances 
amortization expense is broken down as follows acquisition reason for change real media acquired october  website results search  sfas  impairment now marketing assets acquired september  consumernet mail  sfas  sold may  canada  sfas exactis impairment  sold may  sfas no 
states that goodwill is no longer amortized as of january   the adoption of which reduced amortization expense by approximately million

during the first quarter of  we paid experian  the acquirer of exactis  million of the escrow balance  with the remainder paid to the company immediately 
therefore  million of the deferred gain was recognized and million was reversed against the escrow balance 
the remaining loss related to exactis consists of million for unused of prepaid services and million from the reversal of unnecessary accruals related to exactis 
the million gain for the year ended december  consisted of a million gain for the sale of intellectual property related to sabela and a million for the sale of the intellectual property related to awardtrack  offset by a loss of million for the sale of exactis 
impairment of intangibles assets 
as a result of our on going business reviews  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to several of our operating units were less than their carrying values 
accordingly  we recognized million in impairment charges to adjust the carrying values in million related to website results  million related to mail and million related to exactis 
there were no impairment charges recorded in effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  addresses the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives and addresses impairment testing and recognition for goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas establishes a single model for the impairment of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
as required  we had an external valuation of goodwill during for the goodwill that existed at december  we updated this analysis internally for the goodwill that existed at december  neither analysis indicated an impairment of goodwill 
interest income  net 
interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense relates to our notes payable and capital lease obligations 
interest income decreased due to the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense of million in increased due to an increase in the amount and time outstanding of notes payable 
gain on sales of investments 
the gain on sales of investments in related to the sale of our remaining available for sale securities and cost based investment in idealab 
impairment of investments 
during  we wrote down certain of our investments and recognized impairment charges of approximately million for other than temporary declines in value of certain investments 
we made an assessment of the carrying value of our cost based investments and determined that they were in excess of their carrying values due to the significance and duration of the decline in valuations of comparable companies operating in the internet and technology sectors 
the write down of cost based investments was million related to media asia 
we also recognized that the decline in value of our available for sale investments in network commerce and imobile were other than temporary and recorded an impairment of million and million  respectively 
other income 
other income consisted of amounts received for licensing our patents  net of legal expenses 
loss from discontinued operations 
on august   we determined that we would cease funding to our european subsidiaries and communicated that to europe nv s board of directors 
management of europe shut down all operations 
approximately million of the loss from discontinued operations in related to europe 
all revenue  cost and expenses related to the discontinued business are included in this line for the applicable period and prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this presentation in accordance with accounting principles board apb no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
on january   we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  imake 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we accounted for the operations of this component as a discontinued operation 
approximately million of the loss from discontinued operations in related to imake 
our consolidated financial statements have been revised to reflect the sale of the imake subsidiary as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
dividends on preferred stock 
the series a and series b preferred stock issued during accrue and cumulate dividends at a rate of per year  compounded monthly  payable when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
preferred stock conversion discount 
during the third quarter of  we issued series a and series b preferred stock  which are convertible into common stock at prices of and per share  respectively 
at the time we agreed to the initial terms of the transactions with the third parties  the conversion price of the preferred stock approximated the fair value of our underlying common stock 
from the time the agreements were substantially complete until the transactions closed and all contingencies were resolved eg stockholder approval  the stock price increased to approximately per share for the series a and for the series b 
as a result of the increase in stock price  the preferred stock was issued at a substantial discount to fair market value 
in accordance with gaap  the beneficial conversion feature  calculated as the difference between market value on the date of issuance and the conversion price  is required to be expensed immediately  however  the discount was limited to the amount of cash allocable to each of the preferred stock transactions 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the series a preferred stock and million for the series b preferred stock for a total charge of million 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of equity securities  public offerings of our common stock and debt financing 
operating activities used million  million and million in  and  respectively  resulting primarily from our net loss  adjusted for non cash items and other working capital changes 
cash flow from operating activities may be impacted in future periods based on the timing and amount of restructuring payments 
investing activities used million in  related to purchases of computer equipment for general operational purposes  cash used in the acquisition of insight first and investing in ipromotions 
investing activities provided million and million in and  respectively  primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of non core assets  net of expenses  proceeds from the sale of our investments  primarily chinadotcom corporation  and cash acquired in acquisitions 
financing activities provided million in primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  the issuance of subordinated convertible debentures and the exercise of stock options offset by the settlement of notes to publigroupe for million in cash and approximately million shares of common stock 
financing activities provided million in primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock  issuance of notes payable and the exercise of stock options 
financing activities used million in primarily related to payment in settlement for treasury stock  payment of capital lease obligations and the repurchase of a minority interest in canada 
we have various employment agreements with executives in north america  the majority of which are for one year with automatic renewal 
the obligation under these contracts is approximately million for  including salary and target bonuses 
these contracts call for severance related payments upon involuntary termination  which range in amount from three months to one year s salary 
all european employees have employment contracts as required by local law 
the majority of these contracts allow for resignation or termination by either party at any time  according to the notice period provisions contained in the employment contracts  or according to the minimum notice period as mandated by local law 
the contracts  or if no expressed provision is included in the contract  local law  also require severance for involuntary terminations ranging from one to six months 
as of february   there were approximately employees in europe whose annualized base salaries were approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million remaining of cash outlays relating to restructuring and exit costs consisting of severance and rent 
we expect to pay approximately million in  million in each of the years from to and million in no provision for federal or state income taxes has been recorded because we incurred net operating losses for all periods presented 
at december   we had approximately million of us net operating loss carryforwards 
our net operating loss carryforwards expire in various years through as a result of various equity transactions during   and  we believe that we have undergone an ownership change as defined by section of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  utilization of a substantial part of the net operating loss carryforward is limited 
due to our history of operating losses and the section limitation  there is substantial uncertainty surrounding whether we will ultimately realize our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  these assets have been fully reserved 
during and  the valuation allowance decreased by million and million  respectively 
of the total valuation allowance of million  tax benefits recognized in the future of approximately of million will be applied directly to additional paid in capital 
this amount relates to the tax effect of employee stock option deductions included in our net operating loss carryforward 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market demand for our services  the capital required to maintain our technology  and the resources we devote to marketing and selling our services 
we may sell additional equity or debt securities that would result in further dilution to our stockholders 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due both to our current stock price and the significant amount of financing we may raise 
these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
any indebtedness could contain covenants  which restrict our operations 
our subordinated convertible debentures limit our ability to incur additional debt 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
contractual obligations as of december   our principal commitments consisted of million principal amount of our subordinated convertible debentures and our obligations under operating and capital leases 
our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations   capital lease obligations operating lease obligations     purchase obligations warrant liability   other long term liabilities total obligations     operating lease obligations primarily include rental payments for office facilities 
as of december   we have recorded restructuring reserves totaling approximately million relating to excess space at these facilities 
impact of recently issued accounting standards variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  which addresses consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expanded the criteria for consolidation in determining whether a variable interest entity should be consolidated by a business entity  and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities which include  but are not limited to  special purpose entities  or spes to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and applied in the fiscal year or interim period beginning after december   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that is acquired before february  the adoption of fin does not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

risk factors risks related to real media  inc 
we may never be profitable 
we have not achieved profitability in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in any period and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
each of our predecessors had net losses in every year of their operation 
we may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we have a limited operating history on which an investor can evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history 
you must consider the risks  expenses and difficulties typically encountered by companies with limited operating histories  particularly companies in new and rapidly expanding markets such as internet advertising 
these risks include our ability to develop new relationships and maintain existing relationships with our web sites  advertisers  search engine providers and other third parties  continue to develop and upgrade our technology  respond to competitive developments  implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems  adapt to industry consolidation  and attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to predict future revenues and operating expenses 
our business may suffer if we are unable to successfully implement our business model 
a significant part of our business model is to generate revenue by providing interactive marketing solutions to advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers 
the profit potential for this business model is unproven 
to be successful  both internet advertising and our solutions will need to achieve broad market acceptance by advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers 
our ability to generate significant revenue from advertisers will depend  in part  on our ability to contract with web publishers that have web sites with adequate available advertisement space inventory 
further  these web sites must generate sufficient user traffic with demographic characteristics attractive to our advertisers 
the intense competition among internet advertising sellers has led to the creation of a number of pricing alternatives for internet advertising 
these alternatives make it difficult for us to project future levels of advertising revenue and applicable gross margin that can be sustained by us or the internet advertising industry in general 
intensive marketing and sales efforts may be necessary to educate prospective advertisers regarding the uses and benefits of  and to generate demand for  our products and services  including our newer products and services such as search  open advertiser and insight 
enterprises may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that may replace  limit or compete with their existing direct marketing systems 
in addition  since online direct marketing is emerging as a new and distinct business apart from online advertising  potential adopters of online direct marketing services will increasingly demand functionality tailored to their specific requirements 
we may be unable to meet the demands of these clients 
acceptance of our new solutions will depend on the continued emergence of internet commerce  communication and advertising 
demand for our new solutions may not emerge or become sustainable 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast and results in prior periods may not be indicative of future results 
at times in the past and in certain segments  our revenues have grown significantly and also have decreased during certain periods and in certain segments 
accurate predictions of future revenues are difficult because of the rapid changes in our markets and our possible need to sell assets to fund operations 
we have also acquired or disposed of various subsidiaries and product lines over the last several years 
accordingly  investors should not rely on past revenue growth rates as an indicator of future revenue growth 
our results of operations have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the addition of new or loss of existing clients  changes in fees paid by advertisers or other clients  changes in service fees payable by us to owners of web sites  or advertisement serving fees payable by us to third parties  the demand by advertisers and web publishers for our advertising solutions  the introduction of new internet marketing services by us or our competitors  variations in the levels of capital or operating expenditures and other costs relating to the maintenance or expansion of our operations  including personnel costs  changes in governmental regulation of the internet  and general economic conditions 
our future revenues and results of operations may be difficult to forecast due to the above factors 
in addition  our expense levels are based in large part on our investment plans and estimates of future revenues 
any increased expenses may precede or may not be followed by increased revenues  as we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on past periods as indicators of future performance 
in future periods  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations by season and due to general economic conditions 
we believe that our revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations because advertisers generally place fewer advertisements during the first and third calendar quarters of each year 
furthermore  internet user traffic typically drops during the summer months  which reduces the number of advertisements to sell and deliver 
expenditures by advertisers tend to vary in cycles that reflect overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
our revenue could be materially reduced by a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general  which could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or budget cycles or extend our sales cycle 
due to such risks  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of our future results 
our revenue could decline if we fail to effectively manage our existing advertising inventory and our growth could be impeded if we fail to acquire access to new advertising inventory 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively manage our existing advertising inventory 
the web publishers that list their unsold advertising inventory with us are not bound by long term contracts 
in addition  web publishers can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time 
if a web publisher decides not to make advertising space from its web sites available to us  we may not be able to replace this advertising space with advertising space from other web sites that have comparable traffic patterns and user demographics quickly enough to fulfill our advertisers requests 
this would result in lost revenue 
we expect that our customers requirements will become more sophisticated as the web matures as an advertising medium 
if we fail to manage our existing advertising space effectively to meet our customers changing requirements  our revenue could decline 
our growth also depends on our ability to expand our advertising inventory 
to attract new advertisers  we must maintain a consistent supply of attractive advertising space 
we intend to expand our advertising inventory by selectively adding to our network new web publishers that offer attractive demographics  innovative and quality content and large audiences 
our ability to attract new web publishers to our network and to retain web publishers currently in our network will depend on various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include our ability to introduce new and innovative product lines and services  our ability to efficiently manage our existing advertising inventory  our pricing policies and the cost efficiency to web publishers of outsourcing all or part of their advertising sales 
in addition  the number of competing intermediaries that purchase advertising inventory from web publishers continues to increase 
the size of our inventory may not increase or even remain constant in the future 
we could lose customers or advertising inventory if we fail to measure impressions  clicks and actions on advertisements in a manner that is acceptable to our advertisers and web publishers 
we earn advertising revenue and make payments to web publishers based on the number of impressions  clicks and actions from advertisements delivered on our network 
advertisers and web publishers willingness to use our services and join our network will depend on the extent to which they perceive our measurements of clicks to be accurate and reliable 
advertisers and web publishers often maintain their own technologies and methodologies for counting clicks  and from time to time we have had to resolve differences between our measurements and theirs 
any significant dispute over the proper measurement of clicks or other user responses to advertisements could cause us to lose customers or advertising inventory 
our technology solutions may not be successful and may cause business disruption 
open adsystem is our proprietary advertisement serving technology that is intended to serve as our sole advertisement serving solution 
we have developed a variety of products to work on or with this platform 
some of these products  such as our open advertiser  insight act and insight se products  are not yet available or are only available in beta version to some or all of our customers 
we must  among other things  ensure that the technology will function efficiently at high volumes  interact properly with our database  offer the functionality demanded by our customers and assimilate our sales and reporting functions 
we must further complete development of our beta products 
this development effort could fail technologically or could take more time than expected 
customers may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them  including failures affecting our ability to deliver advertisements without significant delay to the viewer 
sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers  advertising agencies and web publishers and result in contract terminations  fee rebates and make goods  thereby reducing our revenue 
slower response time or system failures may also result from straining the capacity of our deployed software or hardware due to an increase in the volume of advertising delivered through our servers 
to the extent that we do not effectively address any capacity constraints or system failures  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we have substantial debt  and we may not generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
in september  we issued to a single holder a subordinated convertible debenture in the principal amount of million that matures in september the amount of our debt could have important consequences  including impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any operating cash flow that we generate to paying principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  limiting our ability to grow and make capital expenditures due to the covenants contained in our debt arrangements  impairing our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  invest in new or developing technologies  or take advantage of significant business opportunities that may arise  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and making us more vulnerable if there is an economic downturn or if our business experiences difficulties 
if we cannot generate sufficient additional cash flow  we may not be able to meet our debt service obligations  repay our debt when due  or comply with other covenants in the subordinated convertible debentures 
if we breach the debentures  the investor could require repayment of all amounts owed  and we may not have sufficient cash reserves to repay such amounts 
we may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
the issuance of stock upon redemption of our subordinated convertible debentures may substantially dilute the interests of other security holders 
stockholders could experience substantial dilution resulting from our election to pay the semi annual accrued interest due in common stock or repay the principal amount in common stock 
we are obligated to make semi annual interest payments on january and july of each year and the entire principal face amount of the debentures is due and payable on september  we may elect to pay interest in cash  in shares of our common stock or in additional debentures 
in addition  if  after september   the price of our common stock does not exceed the conversion price of the debentures for a period of five consecutive trading days we may be required to repurchase million in principal amount of the debentures on september  we may elect to repay the principal amount of the debentures in cash or in shares of our common stock 
if we so elect  payment in shares shall be based upon ninety percent of the average of the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the principal market as reported by bloomberg financial lp during the five trading days immediately prior to the interest payment date  in the case of an interest payment  or during the trading days immediately prior to the maturity date  in the case of the repayment of the principal amount of the debentures 
if we decide to repay the principal in cash we will need additional capital to fund this obligation 
our ability to arrange financing and the cost of this financing will depend upon many factors  including general economic and capital market conditions generally  and in particular the non investment grade debt market  credit availability from banks or other lenders  investor confidence in our industry generally and our company specifically  and provisions of tax and securities law that are conducive to raising capital 
if we need additional funds and are unable to raise them  our inability to raise them will have an adverse effect on our operations 
if we decide to raise additional funds by incurring debt  we may become subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants and ratios 
if we fail to make the mandatory redemptions in cash and if our stock price significantly declines  we could potentially be obligated to issue a larger number of shares of our common stock in redemption of the debentures 
we may need to raise additional funds to continue operations 
an unforeseen reduction in our revenues  an impairment of our receivables  or an increase in expenses or capital expenditures may require us to raise additional funds to continue operations 
to the extent we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we may sell additional equity or debt securities  which would result in further dilution of our stockholders 
stockholders may experience extreme dilution due to our current stock price and the amount of financing we may need to raise and these securities may have rights senior to those of holders of our common stock 
our subordinated convertible debentures limit our ability to incur additional debt  and any future indebtedness that we may incur could contain covenants that restrict our operating flexibility 
we have limited access to the capital markets to raise capital 
the capital markets have been unpredictable in the past  especially for unprofitable companies such as ours 
in addition  it is difficult to raise capital in the current market conditions 
the amount of capital that a company such as ours is able to raise often depends on variables that are beyond our control  such as the share price of our stock and its trading volume 
as a result  efforts to secure financing on terms attractive to us may not be successful  and we may not be able to secure additional financing on any terms 
due to our operating losses  it may be difficult to obtain debt financing 
if we are able to consummate a financing arrangement  the amount raised may not be sufficient to meet our future needs 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  our business  results of operation  financial condition and continued viability will be materially and adversely affected 
we disclose pro forma information  which may exclude items that are important to an investor s understanding of our results of operations 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain pro forma and other non gaap information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this pro forma financial information excludes or may exclude certain special charges and other costs 
we believe the disclosure of the pro forma financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our ongoing operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases  and to compare the gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
our acquisitions  which are important to our growth  may not be successful 
we were formed in february to consolidate three internet advertising companies and have since acquired other companies 
we may continue pursuing selective acquisitions of businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
if we acquire additional companies  we will continue to face risks of integrating and improving our financial and management controls  advertisement serving technology  reporting systems and procedures  and expanding  training and managing our work force 
this process of integration may take a significant period of time and will require the dedication of management and other resources  which may distract management s attention from our other operations 
any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing for future acquisitions  and the potential loss of key employees of any acquired business 
our inability to successfully integrate any acquired company  or failure to achieve any expected synergies  could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to successfully integrate real media korea co  ltd 
into our company 
in january  we completed our acquisition of real media korea co  ltd 
we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals of this acquisition  and this acquisition may not be successful 
the success of this acquisition will depend in part on our ability to expand the business of real media korea into new geographical markets in the region 
we may have difficulty integrating the business and operations of real media korea or retaining their key personnel as well as implementing and maintaining standards  controls  procedures and policies that are consistent with ours 
additionally  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows 
our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code  the availability of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods  which could substantially limit the eventual utilization of these carryforwards 
we could be adversely affected by an impairment of a significant amount of goodwill and or intangible assets on our balance sheet 
in the course of our operating history  we have acquired and disposed of numerous assets and businesses 
some of our acquisitions have resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill and or intangible assets on our financial statements 
the goodwill and or intangible assets were recorded because the fair value of the net assets acquired was less than the purchase price 
we may not realize the full value of the goodwill and or intangible assets 
as such  we evaluate on at least an annual basis whether events and circumstances indicate that all or some of the carrying value of goodwill and or intangible assets are no longer recoverable  in which case we would write off the unrecoverable portion as a charge to our earnings 
to improve our operating performance  we may determine to acquire other assets or businesses complementary to our business and  as a result  we may record additional goodwill and or intangible assets in the future 
the possible write off of the goodwill and or intangible assets could negatively impact our future earnings 
we will also be required to allocate a portion of the purchase price of any acquisition to the value of any intangible assets that meet the criteria specified in the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  such as marketing  customer or contract based intangibles 
the amount allocated to these intangible assets could be amortized over a fairly short period 
as a result  our earnings and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
the success of our search operations depends on a small number of search engine clients  and the loss of a single search engine client could result in a substantial decrease in our search revenue 
we have generated a significant portion of our search revenue from relationships with a small number of search engines  including alta vista  ask jeeves  google  mygeek and overture 
we expect that a small number of search engine clients will continue to generate a majority or more of our search revenue for the foreseeable future 
the interruption or loss of any of our primary search engine relationships could cause a significant decrease in search revenue 
as a result of consolidation among search engines  and other search marketing companies  we could lose one of more of our clients or face increased competition from clients that internally develop or acquire capabilities similar to our service 
in addition  as our search engine clients operations continue to evolve  we may be required to adjust our business strategy to maintain relationships with our clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our search revenue 
our customers and partners may experience adverse business conditions that could adversely affect our business 
as a result of unfavorable conditions in the capital markets  some of our customers may have difficulty raising sufficient capital to support their long term operations 
as a result  these customers have reduced their spending on internet advertising  which has materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have entered into a strategic business relationship with lycos  and may enter into similar relationships with other companies 
these companies may experience similar adverse business conditions that may render them unable to meet our expectations for the strategic business relationship or to fulfill their contractual obligations to us 
such an event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant obligations under our agreement with lycos 
we recently entered into an agreement with lycos  inc to provide media sales  advertisement serving and analytics technology services to lycos us web properties 
this agreement requires us to make a minimum annual payment of million in  along with an initial payment of million to be paid to lycos over the course of we are also required to make minimum annual payments in each subsequent year during the term of the agreement 
our minimum annual payments under this agreement could increase during the term of the agreement 
to the extent that we fail to sell adequate advertising space on lycos web properties  or if prices for advertising space fall below our expectations  our obligations under this agreement may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we expect that lycos will generate a significant portion of our revenues 
if we or lycos is acquired  lycos may have the right to terminate the agreement 
if we lose our ceo or other senior managers  our business will be adversely affected 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our senior management and key sales and technical personnel  particularly david j 
moore  our chief executive officer  david hills  our president  media solutions  and tony schmitz  our chief technology officer and president  technology solutions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these persons could materially and adversely affect our ability to develop our business 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales and marketing  customer support  financial and accounting  and managerial personnel 
we may be unable to retain our key personnel or attract  integrate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
we have experienced in the past  and may continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  especially in sales and marketing positions 
we might experience significant defects in our products 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we might experience significant errors or failures in our products  or they might not work with other hardware or software as expected  which could delay the enhancement of our products  or which could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
any significant product errors or design flaws would slow the adoption of our products and cause damage to our reputation  which would seriously harm our business 
if customers were dissatisfied with product functionality or performance  we could lose revenue or be subject to liability for service or warranty costs and claims  and our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
some of our software is licensed from third parties 
some of our products  including one or more modules for our open adsystem platform  contain software licensed from third parties 
some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future or on terms that are acceptable or allow our products to remain competitive 
our inability to use any of this third party software could result in shipment delays  delays in the development of future products or enhancements of existing products  or other disruptions in our business  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events  including terrorist attacks  because we have limited backup systems 
we have limited backup systems and have experienced system failures and electrical outages from time to time in the past  which have disrupted our operations 
we have a limited disaster recovery plan in the event of damage from fire  floods  typhoons  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
our operations are dependent on our ability to protect our computer systems against these unexpected adverse events 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may experience a complete system shutdown 
any business interruption insurance that we carry is unlikely to be sufficient to compensate us for loss of business in the event of a significant catastrophe 
in addition  interruptions in our services could result from the failure of our telecommunications providers to provide the necessary data communications capacity in the time frame we require 
our open adsystem technology resides on computer systems located in our data centers housed by cable wireless in the united states and level communications in europe 
these systems continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success 
despite precautions that we have taken  unanticipated problems affecting our systems have from time to time in the past caused  and in the future could cause  interruptions in the delivery of our solutions 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays our operations 
to improve the performance and to prevent disruption of our services  we may have to make substantial investments to deploy additional servers or one or more copies of our web sites to mirror our online resources 
although we believe we carry property insurance with adequate coverage limits  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses  particularly with respect to loss of business and reputation  that may occur 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage to our employees  facilities  clients  our clients customers and vendors  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial position 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot be presently predicted 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
our international operations face legal and cultural challenges 
we have operations in a number of international markets  including asia  canada and europe 
to date  we have limited experience in marketing  selling and distributing our solutions internationally 
international operations are subject to other risks  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  general import export restrictions relating to encryption technology and or privacy  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  political and economic instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world 
we may be unable to promote and maintain our brands 
we believe that establishing and maintaining the brand identities of our products and services is a critical aspect of attracting and expanding a large client base 
promotion and enhancement of our brands will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide high quality service 
if businesses do not perceive our existing services to be of high quality  or if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by businesses  we will risk diluting our brand identities and decreasing their attractiveness to existing and potential customers 
in order to attract and retain customers and to promote and maintain brands in response to competitive pressures  we may also have to increase substantially our financial commitment to creating and maintaining a distinct brand loyalty among our customers 
if we incur significant expenses in an attempt to improve our services or to promote and maintain our brands  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  any brand identities we establish may be diluted as a result of any inability to protect our trademarks and service marks or domain names  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the market for our common stock 
we have a very substantial overhang of common stock and future sales of our common stock will cause substantial dilution and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
as of january   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding 
as of that date  we also had an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock that may be sold into the market in the future  including approximately million shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of options  million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and related warrants and million shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and exercise of the related warrants 
in addition  if we undertake an additional financing involving securities convertible into shares of our common stock  the aggregate number of shares into which those securities are convertible will further increase our overhang 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of our common stock into the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or conversion of shares of preferred stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  may materially and adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our share price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and may continue to be volatile 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile 
investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many companies in our industry have been subject to this type of litigation in the past 
we may also become involved in this type of litigation 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the power of our board of directors to designate and issue shares of stock could have an adverse effect on holders of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of common stock  which may be issued by our board of directors for such consideration as they may consider sufficient without seeking stockholder approval 
the issuance of additional shares of common stock in the future will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of current stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes us to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  the rights and preferences of which may be designated by our board of directors 
these designations may be made without stockholder approval 
the designation and issuance of preferred stock in the future could create additional securities that would have dividend and liquidation preferences prior in right to the outstanding shares of common stock 
these provisions could also impede a change in control 
the value of our shares could decline as a result of a reverse stock split of our common stock 
in connection with the implementation of a one for five reverse stock split of our common stock  which took effect on february   the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock was reduced to one fifth of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding 
the par value of the common stock remained unchanged at per share and the number of authorized shares of common stock also remained unchanged 
we cannot predict the effect of the reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock and the history of reverse stock splits for companies in similar circumstances is varied 
the trading price of our common stock may not rise in exact proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as a result of the reverse stock split and there may not be a sustained increase in the trading price of our common stock after giving effect to the reverse stock split 
moreover  the trading price may not remain above the thresholds required by the nasdaq stock market and we may not be able to continue to meet the other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market 
sunra capital holdings ltd 
and publigroupe usa holding  inc 
collectively control a substantial portion of our total outstanding voting power and will likely be able to influence certain approval matters and prevent a change of control 
sunra capital holdings ltd 
is currently the beneficial owner of million shares of our common stock 
publigroupe usa holding  inc is the beneficial owner of million shares of our common stock and has entered into an agreement to vote on all matters in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors 
additionally  the terms of the series a preferred stock  owned solely by sunra  contain certain protective provisions that provide such holders an effective veto right over certain corporate matters 
based on their voting power  sunra and publigroupe may effectively be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  amendment of our charter and approval of significant corporate transactions  and may be in a position to prevent a change in control of real media even if a majority of our other stockholders were in favor of the transaction 
in addition  sunra has the right to designate for election one member of our board of directors 
our preferred stock has liquidation preference and participation rights that could reduce or eliminate any proceeds available to our common stockholders upon a sale of our company 
under certain circumstances  upon our sale  liquidation or dissolution  our series a and series c preferred stockholders may be entitled to receive an aggregate liquidation preference of million plus accrued dividends  before our common stockholders receive any payment 
after receipt of this payment  the preferred stockholders may also have the right to participate in receiving proceeds payable to the common stockholders on an as converted basis 
as a result  in the event of our sale  liquidation or dissolution  including one in which the total proceeds represent a premium to the then prevailing price per share of our common stock  our common stockholders may experience substantial dilution in the amount payable to them  and if total proceeds are less than or equal to the liquidation preference  then our common stockholders will not receive any proceeds 
effects of anti takeover provisions could inhibit the acquisition of our company 
some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  impede the ability of our stockholders to change the composition of our board of directors in any one year  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay future cash dividends 
we currently do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the near future 
we may never pay cash dividends or distributions on our common stock 
in addition  our subordinated convertible debentures restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock 
whether we pay cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  contractual restrictions and any other factors that the board of directors decides is relevant 
risks related to our industry 
our business may not grow if the internet advertising market does not continue to develop 
the internet as a marketing medium has not been in existence for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate its effectiveness 
our business would be adversely affected if the internet advertising market fails to develop in the near future 
there are currently no widely accepted standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising other than clickthrough rates  which generally have been declining 
such standards may not develop to sufficiently support the internet as a significant advertising medium 
actual or perceived ineffectiveness of online advertising in general  or inaccurate measurements or database information in particular  could limit the long term growth of online advertising and cause our revenue levels to decline 
our failure to compete successfully may hinder our growth 
the markets for internet advertising and related products and services are intensely competitive and such competition is expected to increase 
our failure to compete successfully may hinder our growth 
we believe that our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control  including the timing and market acceptance of new products and enhancements of existing services developed by us and our competitors  changing demands regarding customer service and support  shifts in sales and marketing efforts by us and our competitors  and the ease of use  performance  price and reliability of our services and products 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than ours 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products or services to address the needs of our prospective clients 
we may be unable to compete successfully against current or future competitors 
in addition  the internet must compete for a share of advertisers total budgets with traditional advertising media  such as television  radio  cable and print  as well as content aggregation companies and other companies that facilitate internet advertising 
to the extent that the internet is perceived to be a limited or ineffective advertising medium  advertisers may be reluctant to devote a significant portion of their advertising budgets to internet advertising  which could limit the growth of internet advertising 
changes in government regulation could decrease our revenues and increase our costs 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the united states congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
state governments or governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
the laws governing the internet  however  remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
it may take years to determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property  privacy  libel and taxation apply to the internet and internet advertising 
in addition  the growth and development of internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
changes in laws and standards relating to data collection and use practices and the privacy of internet users and other individuals could harm our business 
the us federal and various state governments have recently proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users 
in october  the european union adopted a directive that may limit our collection and use of information regarding internet users in europe 
the effectiveness of our open adsystem technology could be limited by any regulation limiting the collection or use of information regarding internet users 
since many of the proposed laws or regulations are just being developed  we cannot yet determine the impact these regulations may have on its business 
in addition  growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of personal information has led to self regulation of these practices by the internet advertising and direct marketing industry and to increased federal and state regulation 
the network advertising initiative  or nai  of which we are an associate member along with other internet advertising companies  has developed self regulatory principles for online preference marketing 
we are also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection  distribution and use of personal information 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit information 
although our compliance with the nai s guidelines and applicable federal and state laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on us  additional  more burdensome federal or state laws or regulations  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  could be enacted or applied to us or our clients  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
privacy concerns may prevent us from collecting user data 
growing concerns about the use of cookies and data collection may limit our ability to develop user profiles 
web sites typically place small files of information  commonly known as cookies  on a user s hard drive  generally without the user s knowledge or consent 
cookie information is passed to the web site through the internet user s browser software 
our open adsystem technology targets advertising to users through the use of cookies and other non personally identifying information 
open adsystem enables the use of cookies to deliver targeted advertising and to limit the frequency with which an advertisement is shown to a user 
most currently available internet browsers allow users to modify their browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored on their hard drive  and a small minority of users are currently choosing to do so 
users can also delete cookies from their hard drive or modify them at any time 
some internet commentators and privacy advocates have suggested limiting or eliminating the use of cookies 
any reduction or limitation in the use of cookies could limit the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and impair our targeting capabilities 
microsoft corporation has changed the design and instrumentation of its web browser in such a way as to give users the option to accept or reject third party cookies 
giving users the option to decline such cookies could result in a reduction of the number of internet users that we can profile anonymously 
such changes also could adversely affect our ability to determine the reach of advertising campaigns sold and delivered by us and the frequency with which users of sites in the network see the same advertisement 
if the use or effectiveness of cookies is limited  we would likely have to switch to other technology that would allow us to gather demographic and behavioral information 
while such technology currently exists  it is substantially less effective than cookies 
replacement of cookies could require significant engineering time and resources  might not be completed in time to avoid negative consequences to our business  financial condition or results of operations  and might not be commercially feasible 
we depend on proprietary rights  and we face the risk of infringement 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
we have received two patents in the united states  and have filed and intend to file additional patent applications in the united states 
in addition  we apply to register our trademarks in the united states and internationally 
our patent applications or trademark applications may not be approved 
even if they are approved  such patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
if our trademark registrations are not approved because third parties own such trademarks  our use of such trademarks will be restricted unless we enter into arrangements with such third parties that may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our solutions or technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our solutions or technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  elements of our trademarks  trade dress and similar proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by these business partners  such partners may take actions that could materially and adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
the value of our proprietary rights could decline in the future since the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of certain proprietary rights in internet related industries is uncertain and still evolving 
we may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or the web publishers with web sites in the network 
such claims and any resultant litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims or litigation from third parties may also result in limitations on our ability to use the trademarks and other intellectual property subject to such claims or litigation unless we enter into arrangements with the third parties responsible for such claims or litigation  which may be unavailable on commercially reasonable terms 
from time to time  we may selectively pursue claims of infringement of our patents and other intellectual property rights by third parties 
such claims and any resultant litigation  such as our ongoing litigation with aquantive  inc  present the risk that a court could determine  either preliminarily or finally  that some of our patents or other intellectual property rights are not valid  which may make it difficult to sell our technology solutions and may lead to a loss of and an inability to generate licensing revenue from our patents 
in addition  even if we prevail  such litigation could be time consuming and expensive to pursue  and could result in the diversion of our time and attention  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see business legal proceedings 
we may be subject to intellectual property liability 
we may be liable for content available or posted on the web sites of our publishers 
we may be liable to third parties for content in the advertising we serve if the music  artwork  text or other content involved violates the copyright  trademark or other intellectual property rights of such third parties or if the content is defamatory 
any claims or counterclaims could be time consuming  result in costly litigation or divert management s attention 
we face risks associated with technological change 
the internet and internet advertising markets are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product and service introductions and changing customer demands 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and to enhance existing solutions and develop and introduce a variety of new solutions to address our customers changing demands 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful design  development  introduction or marketing of our solutions 
in addition  our new solutions or enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
material delays in introducing new solutions and enhancements may cause customers to forego purchases of our solutions and purchase those of our competitors 
our network operations may be vulnerable to hacking  viruses and other disruptions  which may make our products and services less attractive and reliable 
internet usage could decline if any well publicized compromise of security occurs 
hacking involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data  software  hardware or other computer equipment 
hackers  if successful  could misappropriate proprietary information or cause disruptions in our service 
we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect our web site against hackers 
any measures we may take may not be effective 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability  as well as materially damage our reputation and decrease our user traffic 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
cash and cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by real media 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  in thousands thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate liabilities subordinated convertible debentures average interest rate the subordinated convertible debentures due contains a provision that gives the holder the ability to call a portion of the note upon the satisfaction of a trading price condition 
this condition constitutes an embedded derivative 
the value of this embedded derivative at december  is immaterial to the financial position 
we will review the value of the derivative on a quarterly basis in the future  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december   we did not hold any other derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk we transact business in a variety of foreign countries and are thus subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenue and operating expenses denominated in european currencies 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations for  and were not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit our foreign currency risk exposure 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies
