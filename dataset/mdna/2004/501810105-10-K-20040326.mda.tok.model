overview we provide integrated end to end solutions for wireless voice and data communications networks with offerings ranging from high level technical consulting  to system design and turnkey deployment  to ongoing management and optimization services 
we have been successful on occasion in using initial opportunities to provide high level technical consulting services to secure later stage system design and deployment contracts 
long term engagements to provide design and deployment services also enable us to secure ongoing management and operations projects 
providing ongoing operations and maintenance services also positions us well for additional opportunities as new technologies continue to be developed and wireless service providers must either upgrade their existing networks or deploy new networks utilizing the latest available technologies 
we provide these services through a regional organization  which comprises two principal regions and several smaller divisions 
in  we redefined our operating segments to be compatible with this regional organization 
our primary operating segments are americas and emea europe  middle east and africa 
americas headquartered near los angeles  california  the americas region provides the full range of service offerings to wireless operators and equipment vendors through a network of project offices in north america  central and south america 
in  americas generated approximately of our total revenue 
emea based in london  the europe  middle east and africa region is responsible for operations in the uk  italy  netherlands  algeria  germany  spain and greece 
emea also undertakes projects throughout its region and we have recently established a marketing office in dubai 
in  emea also generated approximately of our total revenue 
asia other this includes our operations in asia  the wireless institute and our new wireline division 
in  these combined operations generated approximately of our total revenues 
our operations in asia comprise a marketing office in sydney and representative offices in beijing and singapore 
our joint venture with boco is also based in beijing 
we provide training to our engineers and customers through our wireless institute  which covers the latest technologies developed and employed throughout the world 
in  we formed lcc wireline  inc  to pursue wireline related contracts with clecs and ilecs 
the key drivers of growth in our wireless services business have been the issuance of new or additional licenses to wireless service providers  which generates new network build out  the introduction of new services or technologies such as wireless number portability  or wnp  satellite digital radio  wireless broadband  and push to talk services  the increases in the number of subscribers served by wireless service providers  the increase in usage by those subscribers  and the scarcity of wireless spectrum  which require wireless service providers to expand and optimize system coverage and capacity to maintain network quality  and the increasing complexity of wireless systems in operation  which requires wireless service providers to upgrade their existing networks or deploy new networks to benefit from the latest available technologies 
our primary sources of revenues are from engineering design and system deployment services 
revenues from services are derived both from fixed price and time and materials contracts 
we recognize revenues from fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method and therefore recognize revenues based on the ratio of individual contract costs incurred to date on a project compared with total estimated costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known and estimable 
we recognize revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
cost of revenues includes direct compensation and benefits  living and travel expenses  payments to third party subcontractors and consultants  equipment rentals  expendable computer software and equipment  and allocated  or directly attributed  facility and overhead costs identifiable to projects 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation  benefits  office and occupancy  and other costs required for the finance  human resources  information systems  and executive office functions 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and other related expenses required to implement our marketing  sales and customer support plans 
we generate cash from fixed price contracts by billings associated with contract milestones  which are typically agreed with our customers at the time the contracts are negotiated 
for our time and materials contracts  we usually bill our customers on a monthly basis as services are performed 
on large network deployment contracts  which involve the design and construction of complex wireless networks  it is increasingly common for our customers to require fewer contract milestones than in previous years 
this results in extending the periods during which we are obliged to fund our operating costs until a milestone can be billed to the customer 
this increases the capital that we require to operate the business  and is evidenced by increases in unbilled receivables on our balance sheet 
this is an integral part of our business and we are constantly striving to manage our working capital requirements 
we expect to experience increasing demands for working capital in the future as we grow our revenues 
another critical statistic that we monitor is our contract backlog  which at december   comprised firm backlog of million and implied backlog of million 
we expect that our contract backlog will vary from time to time as we deliver contract revenues and win new awards 
given that our backlog in reached a record level for our design and deployment services  it is reasonable to expect that our backlog may decrease over the near term 
since  we have engaged in a number of business dispositions  acquisitions and investments  some of which have either generated significant cash proceeds or created significant requirements for cash and these transactions significantly affect the year to year comparability of our financial statements 
for example  in we disposed of our hardware and software products business for cash proceeds of about million  in  we sold our tower business for cash proceeds of about million  and in  we sold certain of our interests in nextwave telecom  inc  or nextwave  for cash proceeds of about million 
later in that year and during  we acquired operations in our emea region  which required cash of approximately million 
in we sold further interests in nextwave for another million and we initiated our investment in the joint venture in china  which has a total cash commitment of about million 
we expect to continue to consider business dispositions  acquisitions and investments as a way of supporting our longer term strategies 
trends that have affected or may affect results of operations and financial condition the major trends that have affected or may affect our business are as follows project related revenues derived from a limited set of customers in each market where we do business  the difficulties that our customers often face in obtaining financing to fund the development  expansion and upgrade of their networks  the acceleration or the delay associated with the introduction of new technologies and services by our customers  the management and the services composition of our fixed price contracts  and increased spending by wireless service providers in the areas of network design  deployment and optimization 
our business is characterized by a limited number of projects awarded by a limited number of customers 
this can lead to volatility in our results as projects initially ramp up and then wind down 
as projects are completed  we are faced with the task of replacing project revenues with new projects  either from the same customer or from new customers 
for example  the completion of the xm satellite radio project the xm project in the first quarter of caused our revenues in to decline dramatically from our revenues in the delay in replacing revenues derived from the xm project contract and the difficult marketplace caused gross profit as a percentage of total revenues to decline and our cost reduction measures were not sufficient to return us to profitability 
in addition  the wireless industry is composed of a relatively small number of wireless service providers and equipment vendors  and this inevitably leads to issues of customer concentration 
consequently  our business may be affected in any single market by the changing priorities of a small group of customers 
some of our customers have faced difficulty in obtaining the necessary financing to fund the development  expansion and upgrade of their networks 
the slowdown in the world economies since and the volatility in the financial markets have made it increasingly difficult for our customers to predict both future demand for their services and future levels of capital expenditure 
this has resulted in the delay or postponement of the development of new networks and expansion and the upgrade of existing networks  all of which have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our business 
we tend to benefit from projects undertaken by our customers to introduce new technologies and services in their networks and we tend to suffer when projects are delayed 
for example  the introduction of g equipment and services by several major wireless service providers in europe has resulted in an increase in demand for our services in certain markets 
revenues from g networks constituted approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and it is expected to continue to be an area of business growth in the future 
we have experienced an increase in the percentage of fixed price contracts awarded by our customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
a recent trend is for the award of fixed price contracts to cover the design and deployment of a certain geographic network area on a full turnkey basis  including planning  engineering design  site acquisition  construction and deployment services 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by work done by subcontractors  principally for construction related activities  and approximately of our revenues were generated by work that we perform through our own workforce 
to the extent that these large turnkey projects include a relatively large proportion of construction related activities  we expect that the composition of our revenues by delivery method will vary so as to decrease the proportion of services that we perform ourselves through our own workforce and increase the services that we deliver through third parties  typically subcontractors for construction 
a consequence of this change in mix may be to reduce our average gross margins because subcontracted work generally commands lower margins 
we believe our americas region may benefit from increased spending by certain united states wireless service providers 
despite some estimates that capital expenditures by united states wireless service providers would be lower than expenditures for  we observed an increase in spending in the areas of network design  deployment and optimization by several of these providers 
this increased spending can be attributed to several trends i the preparation for number portability which was implemented on november   ii license swaps as a result of wireless service providers trying to maximize spectrum utilization and increase coverage  iii network quality enhancement programs to reduce churn  iv network expansion and capacity programs geared toward enabling new and enhanced services  and v other miscellaneous network upgrades and enhancements required for market share maintenance and competitive reasons 
for example  sprint engaged us in july to perform project management and deployment services in sprint s northern central region and to provide radio frequency engineering and cell site acceptance testing throughout several of sprint s other regions 
we estimate that the value of the sprint contract is approximately million and the duration of the engagement to be between to months 
us cellular engaged us in april to perform project management and radio frequency engineering services primarily in midwest and northeast markets 
we estimate that the value of the us cellular contract is approximately million and the duration of the engagement to be between to months 
we have also observed an increase in spending on wireless networks in developing countries 
for example  in early  we commenced two new projects in algeria  building upon the presence that we established in that country in the projects in algeria include consulting services  equipment supply and turnkey deployment 
our business in algeria contributed a significant part of our revenues in for the emea region  and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant revenues from opportunities of this nature in the future 
for example  we were selected in march by stc to provide approximately million worth of engineering consulting services for the expansion of stc s gsm network in saudi arabia over months  with the possibility of renewal for an additional year at stc s discretion 
results of operations the discussion below provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
revenues  cost of revenues and gross margins years ended december  in thousands in thousands in thousands revenues americas emea asia and other of revenue of revenue of revenue cost of revenues americas emea asia and other gross margin americas emea asia and other americas in  the xm project accounted for million or of total revenue for the americas region 
revenues for the xm project decreased to million or in and  at the same time  there was a general slow down in wireless infrastructure spending and deployment in the us market 
revenue from projects other than the xm project fell from million in to million in cost of revenues and gross margins in were dominated by the xm project  and in we incurred a loss of million to complete the xm project 
in addition in  the region was not able to generate sufficient volumes from work not related to the xm project to fully absorb our overhead costs and this led to a reduced gross margin of approximately 
in  the wireless market improved and opportunities increased for both rf wireless design work and for network deployment 
in the second half of  we began to recognize revenues associated with two large network deployment contracts awarded earlier in the year  us cellular and sprint 
the award of these major contracts  together with the steady growth in the region s rf wireless design business  enabled the region to bring its gross margins into a more normal expected range 
during the year  the region increased its use of subcontractors for the construction of cell sites in its network deployment business  and this also contributed to an increase in its cost of revenues 
in  subcontractors represented of the total revenue delivered by the region 
it is expected that the revenues in the immediate future will be dominated by the execution of the existing network deployment contracts already in backlog  while the rf wireless design business should continue to exhibit steady growth 
we will continue to use subcontractors to construct cell sites as part of network deployment activities 
it is reasonable to expect that composition of revenues by delivery method  being the mix of self perform and subcontract revenues  will continue to change as the existing network deployment projects are implemented and the emphasis moves from design and acquisition to cell site construction 
despite this anticipated change in the mix of delivery  it is expected that gross margins will not be materially different for the immediate future 
emea in  the emea region was composed of a number of stand alone projects  including one large project in egypt  which accounted for million of the region s total revenue 
we incurred a million loss in the same year to complete our project in egypt resulting in a negative impact on gross margin 
following a change in strategy in late  we acquired operations in local markets in the region  specifically transmast in italy in december  smith woolley telecom in the united kingdom in january and of detron in the netherlands in july the increase in revenues in the emea region between and is mostly attributable to the acquisition and subsequent growth of these operations 
in addition  we won our first contract in algeria and this contributed approximately million of revenue in but it had no effect on the gross margin 
the absolute increase in cost of revenues from to was mostly attributable to the operations acquired in late and  as described above 
in  the acquired operations continued to grow  and we won additional programs in algeria 
total revenue from algeria in amounted to million or of the total revenue for the region 
total gross margin in for the region increased to approximately of revenue 
this reflected improved efficiencies as the acquired operations grew in volume  coupled with a higher proportion of self perform services from the algerian projects  which typically carry lower cost of revenues 
it is expected that revenues in the immediate future are likely to reflect the continued growth of the acquired operations  together with the growth of new operations in emerging markets in the region  at gross margins broadly consistent with those experienced in while it is expected that algeria will contribute less revenues going forward  we will continue to pursue large multi year services projects in the region such as the new saudi arabian project  leveraging our reputation for engineering and technical consultancy 
asia and other asia and other generated revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which consisted of revenues from our asian operations  our wireless institute and lcc wireline 
in  we closed an investment for a share in a joint venture in beijing  china  with boco 
it is anticipated that we will pursue opportunities in china primarily through this joint venture 
in  we formed lcc wireline  which focuses on providing technical services to clecs and ilecs 
although revenues were minimal  these operations may be a source of meaningful revenues in the future at gross margins broadly consistent with the gross margins generally achieved by our company on other projects 
operating expenses years ended december  in thousands operating expenses net bad debt expense or recovery general and administrative total general and administrative sale and marketing restructuring tower gain depreciation in  net bad debt recoveries of million included recoveries of million  offset by expenses of million 
recoveries were primarily related to our bankruptcy claims against dcr pcs  inc and pocket communications  inc of about million and a malaysian corporation of about million 
these receivables had been fully reserved for in previous years 
in  net expense of million included expenses of million  offset by a final settlement from pocket communications  inc of million 
included in the expenses of million were million attributable to a provision against the receivable arising on a project in algeria  and million attributable to the final settlement of the xm project 
in  the entire amount previously provided for in for the algerian project was subsequently recovered 
general and administrative expenses  exclusive of bad debts recoveries  decreased by million or from million in to million in general and administrative expenses in the americas region and corporate decreased by about million as a result of our efforts to restructure the business following the completion of the xm project and the general reduction in the us market s wireless infrastructure spending 
at the same time  general and administrative expenses in emea increased by about million in as a result of acquiring the operations in the region in late and in  general and administrative expenses increased by million or  reflecting a full year s cost of support for the acquired operations  their subsequent growth  and support for the additional contracts in algeria 
sales and marketing expenses increased initially from to by approximately million or  mostly as the result of acquiring and then building local market operations in emea 
in  we decreased sales and marketing expenses by million or through efficiencies in the emea region and the reduction of costs in asia following the strategic decision to focus on the joint venture in china 
in  following the completion of the xm project and the general reduction in the us market s wireless infrastructure spending  we restructured our operations and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
of this total charge  approximately million related to excess office space and million to severance costs for about employees 
in  we agreed to sell certain telecommunication towers  and  as part of that agreement  we agreed to lease unoccupied space on those towers 
consequently  about million of the gain realized on the sale of the towers in was deferred until the unoccupied space was leased  and this resulted in us recognizing million of the gain in and the balance of million in in  we ceased using the trade name acquired at the time of the purchase of smith woolley telecom in january therefore  depreciation and amortization expense in included the write off about million  which was the unamortized balance of intangible cost allocated to the trade name 
other income and expense years ended december  in thousands other income expense interest income interest expense other gain loss on investments impairment of assets other interest income reduced in   and as a result of lower average balances of cash deposits combined with decreases in available yields on short term investments 
gain on investments in related to the sale of our interests in nextwave million and tecnosistemi million 
in  we disposed of of our interest in an egyptian operation and subsequently recorded a gain of million 
in  we sold a prepetition bankruptcy interest in nextwave and recorded a gain of million 
in  we recorded impairment charges for our investments in plan design netcare ag million and mobilocity  inc million 
tax benefit or expense years ended december  statutory federal income tax rate effect of state and local income taxes  net of federal tax benefit foreign and tax credits non deductible expenses and permanent items other valuation allowance of deferred tax assets effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate is estimated on the basis of the income or loss before tax  and is subject to change following the completion of our annual tax returns 
this rate is also subject to considerable variation quarter by quarter during the year  depending on the latest estimates of operating performance by tax jurisdiction  assumptions regarding the treatment of foreign losses and the possible treatment of existing tax provisions and foreign tax credits 
adjustment to this rate during the year can result in cumulative adjustments for tax benefits or expenses already recorded during the year 
see further discussion under critical accounting policies 
net income or loss in  revenues of million generated operating income of million  which included tower gains of million 
gains on the sale of investments plus interest income contributed million  resulting in income before taxes of million 
tax expense was million  equivalent to an effective tax rate of  resulting in a reported net income of million 
in  revenues of million generated an operating loss of million  which included restructuring charges of million offset by tower gains of million 
impairment charges  gain on sale of an investment plus net interest income resulted in further losses of million  resulting in a loss before taxes of million 
tax benefit was million  equivalent to an effective tax rate of  resulting in a reported net loss of million 
in  revenues of million generated an operating loss of million 
gain on sale of an investments plus net interest income contributed million  resulting in a loss before taxes of million 
tax benefit was million  equivalent to an effective tax rate of  resulting in a reported net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion relates to our sources and uses of cash and cash requirements during   and sources and uses of cash years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in  operations that generated revenues of million and operating income of million  used million of cash  before investing and financing activities are considered 
net cash used in operations consisted of million to fund operating losses and another million was used to finance increases in operating assets and liabilities 
the sale of short term investments in generated another million and the sale of our primary interests in nextwave generated another million net 
after deducting the purchase of property and equipment of million and the acquisition of transmast operations in italy for million  total cash provided by financing activities amounted to million 
overall  cash increased million primarily due to non operational reasons 
in  the level of operational activity declined and cash used in operations decreased to million 
net cash used in operations consisted of million to fund operating losses  offset by million provided by operating assets and liabilities 
we used about million to acquire operations in the emea region and used another million for the purchase of property and equipment 
overall  cash was reduced by about million during  primarily reflecting our strategic acquisitions in emea 
in  the level of operational activities increased significantly  with revenues increasing to million and an operating loss decreasing to million 
cash used in operations increased to million which consisted of million to fund operating losses and million to finance growth in our operating assets and liabilities  offset by the receipt of million of tax refunds 
cash used in investing activities was million  of which million was for property and equipment purchases and million for business acquisitions primarily the joint venture in china 
financing activities generated million  of which million was the net proceeds from the public offering of  shares of our class a common stock 
additionally  million was provided by the drawdowns on the line of credit established for detron in the netherlands 
overall  cash decreased by million in cash requirements years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments total cash and short term investments line of credit working capital during  as described above  the principal requirements for cash were to fund operating losses and finance the increase in working capital  driven by the growth in receivables resulting from the increase in revenue 
these requirements were partly satisfied by the sale of new shares in the public offering and the receipt of federal and state tax refunds 
however  as stated above  cash and cash equivalents was reduced by million during the year 
future requirements of cash are likely to be affected by the continued growth in working capital  which is anticipated as contract revenues currently in backlog are delivered over the next twelve to eighteen months 
these increases are primarily caused by growth in unbilled receivables and work in progress as work is performed ahead of contractual billing milestones 
working capital then reduces as those milestones are achieved  billings are made and payments received from the customers 
over the next year  it is expected that working capital will grow during the first half of the year and then reduce during the second half as the implementation plans on the major network deployment contracts in the americas region are performed 
consequently  we expect our total cash balances to further decline in the short term  primarily due to the implementation of these major network deployment contracts 
despite this expected decline  we believe that for at least the next twelve months we have adequate cash and short term investments to fund our operations existing contractual obligations are primarily limited to operating leases  mostly for office facilities 
those obligations are set out below 
fixed lease obligations are partly offset by income from sublease agreements 
our operating lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations sublease income purchases of property and equipment are primarily related to project requirements  but are relatively insignificant compared to other requirements 
from time to time  we have made acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  and it is possible that this may be a source of cash requirements at some time in the future 
there are no immediate plans or commitments of this nature  which would result in significant cash requirements 
taxes are likely to be a cash requirement in the future  but no significant needs are projected in the immediate future 
we do not expect to collect significant federal or state tax refunds in the immediate future similar to those received in in  we have established a line of credit for our subsidiary in the netherlands  collateralized by detron s outstanding accounts receivable 
from time to time  we may establish other lines of credit to discount trade receivables 
cash or outstanding accounts receivable may collateralize such accounts 
during  we sold  shares of our class a common stock for net proceeds of approximately million as part of a public offering 
we may consider selling additional shares in the future  either to provide additional working capital or for specific purposes  such as acquisitions 
in  we negotiated the terms and conditions of a line of credit of million for the issue of standby letters of credit  which  when executed  will be used to support the issue of bid and performance bonds and guarantees 
each standby letter of credit issued under such line of credit is required to be fully collateralized by cash 
in the case of any standby letter of credit denominated in a foreign currency  the cash collateral requirement is of the us dollar equivalent of the foreign currency amount of the letter of credit 
we expect to finalize this line of credit in the immediate future 
we had no material cash commitments as of december  other than to fund the third and final installment of million for our joint venture in china with boco  which was funded in january we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing as of december  critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  and restructuring charge 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenues consists of design and system deployment services 
we provide design services on a contract basis  usually in a customized plan for each client  and generally charge for engineering services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
we generally offer deployment services on a fixed price  time certain basis 
the portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts was in and in we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
with the percentage of completion method  expenses on each project are recognized as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on the ratio of the current costs incurred for the project to the then estimated total costs of the project 
accordingly  revenues recognized in a given period depend on  among other things  the costs incurred on each individual project and our then current estimate of the total remaining costs to complete individual projects 
considerable judgment on the part of our management may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of the work to be completed  and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some task s 
if in any period we significantly increase the estimate of the total costs to complete a project  we may recognize very little or no additional revenues with respect to that project 
if total contract cost estimates increase  gross profit for any single project may be significantly reduced or eliminated 
if the total contract cost estimates indicate that there is a loss  the loss is recognized in the period the determination is made 
at december  and  respectively  we had million and million of unbilled receivables 
the increase in unbilled receivables is attributable to an increase in fixed price contracts and the overall growth in revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the probability of collection of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
for the years ended december  and  we derived and  respectively  of total revenues from our ten largest customers  indicating significant customer concentration risk with our receivables 
these ten largest customers constituted and of our net receivable balance as of december  and  respectively 
lastly  we frequently perform services for development stage customers  which carry a higher degree of risk  particularly as to the collection of accounts receivable 
these customers may be particularly vulnerable to the current tightening of available credit and general economic slowdown 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements an estimate for income taxes is required for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event the actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance  which could materially have an impact on the financial position and results of operations 
considerable management judgment may be required in determining our provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets before they expire 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of foreign net operating losses carried forward  foreign tax credits and non cash compensation accruals relating to stock options issued under a phantom membership plan in effect prior to our initial public offering 
the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  were million and million  respectively 
restructuring charge we recorded a restructuring charge during the second quarter of and an additional charge during the fourth quarter of included in this restructuring charge of million was a charge for excess facilities aggregating million 
this facility charge primarily relates to leased office space  which we no longer occupy 
the facility charge equals the existing lease obligation less anticipated rental receipts to be received from existing and potential subleases 
anticipating such rental receipts requires significant judgments about the length of time the space will remain vacant  anticipated cost escalators and operating costs associated with the leases  the market rate at which the space will be subleased  and broker fees or other costs necessary to market the space 
these judgments were based upon independent market analysis and assessment from experienced real estate brokers 
the restructuring charge calculation assumes as of december  that we will receive million in sublease income  of which million is committed 
related party transactions prior to our initial public offering  both our employees and the employees of telcom ventures were eligible to participate in our life  medical  dental and k plans 
in connection with our initial public offering in  we agreed pursuant to an overhead and administrative services agreement to allow the employees of telcom ventures to continue to participate in our employee benefit plans in exchange for full reimbursement of our cash costs and expenses 
we billed telcom ventures  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively  for payments made by us pursuant to this agreement 
we received reimbursements from telcom ventures of  during which included payments for prior periods and  during at december  and  outstanding amounts associated with payments made by us under this agreement were  and  respectively  and are included as due from related parties and affiliates within the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying financial statements 
we also had an understanding with telcom ventures pursuant to which from july  to december  we retained five employees who had worked in the business development group of our tower subsidiary  microcell management  inc  before the assets of that subsidiary were sold in march during the six month period  these employees pursued international telecommunications tower business opportunities on telcom ventures behalf 
in return  we would be telcom ventures exclusive provider of project management  radio frequency engineering and deployment services for any tower related projects secured by these employees during this six month period 
in addition  telcom ventures reimbursed us for all costs incurred in employing these persons including payroll and benefit costs 
this arrangement has been terminated 
we received reimbursements from telcom ventures of  during for outstanding amounts associated with this arrangement 
at december   outstanding amounts associated with payments made by us under this arrangement were  in expense reimbursements and other payments for that were disputed by telcom ventures 
this matter was fully resolved in april with telcom ventures payment of the full  in dispute 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under this arrangement 
the amounts outstanding as of december   less reserves  are included as due from related parties and affiliates within the consolidated balance sheets in the accompanying financial statements in july  we acquired of the outstanding shares of detron  a newly formed corporation in the netherlands 
we acquired the shares from westminster bv westminster  which transferred the shares to detron corporation bv in january detron has certain ongoing transactions with westminster 
under a five year lease agreement for office space  detron recorded approximately  of rent expense from the date of acquisition to december  and million for the year ended december  during the second half and all of  detron seconded various idle employees to detron telematics  westminster s wholly owned subsidiary and recorded revenue of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with both liability and equity characteristics 
it requires that an issuer classify a freestanding financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or as an asset in some circumstances 
many of these freestanding financial instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
became effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  we have evaluated the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements with respect to our right to buy out the minority interests in several of our subsidiaries 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in great britain  the netherlands  italy and brazil 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the united states dollar value of their reported earnings and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries 
customers outside of the united states accounted for and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  the majority of which were in europe 
in connection with our recent acquisitions and the increased availability of g equipment in europe  we anticipate continued growth of its international operations  particularly in europe  the middle east and africa  in and beyond 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the united states dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher  respectively 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the united states dollar amount of our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of the non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the euro was stronger relative to many of the foreign currencies at december   compared to december  consequently  the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity decreased million during the year ended december  as of december   the total amount of long term intercompany receivable payables in non us subsidiaries subject to this equity adjustment  using the exchange rate as of the same date  was million 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations due to the operations of short term intercompany transactions between the london office and the consolidated foreign subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
foreign subsidiaries with amounts owed to or from the london operations at december  denominated in euros include italy in the amount of million and the netherlands in the amount of million 
these balances generated a foreign exchange gain of million included in our consolidated results at december  a hypothetical appreciation of the euro and british pound of would result in a million net increase to our operating losses generated outside the united states 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
foreign exchange gains and losses recognized on any transactions are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
although currency fluctuations can have an impact on our reported results and shareholders equity  such fluctuations generally do not affect our cash flow or result in actual economic gains or losses 
we currently do not hedge any of these risks in its foreign subsidiaries because i our subsidiaries generally earn revenues and incur expenses within a single country and  consequently  do not incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal operations  ii other foreign operations are minimal  and iii we do not believe that hedging transactions are justified by the current exposure and cost at this time
