item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview during  the company focused its efforts on several key areas 
the company s international life business continued to grow during  despite continuing economic problems in some latin american markets that historically have been large sources of new premiums 
during the year  new marketing organizations were contracted in the pacific rim and other locations around the world 
management believes will see further increases in new production 
the company s book of accident and health business continued to be a source of significant overhead and attention 
during the latter part of the year  discussions began with another insurer that culminated in a reinsurance arrangement that was signed in march whereby all of the in force accident and health business will be ceded to another reinsurer effective january  see discussion of accident and health business below 
as a result of this activity management expects to achieve overhead reductions of at least million in development of our usa marketing operations continued 
changes were made in the management of this program in late and early  and senior company executives have taken over the development program 
management continues to seek acquisitions that can add value to the company 
during  two transactions were completed 
because of the growth in the company s asset base and level of capital  management is exploring opportunities for larger acquisition transactions those in the million to million purchase price range 
during  a million line of credit was negotiated with regions bank which should be available during the first quarter of upon signing of formal loan documents in order to permit the company to pursue larger transactions 
acquisitions and mergers on february   we acquired all the outstanding shares of first alliance corporation first alliance  the parent of first alliance insurance company  a kentucky life insurer  for approximately million shares of our class a common stock 
the aggregate market value of the consideration was approximately million 
on november   we acquired all the outstanding shares of mid american alliance corporation mid american  the parent of mid american century life insurance company  a missouri life insurer  for approximately  shares of our class a common stock 
the aggregate market value of the consideration was approximately million 
management believes that the above acquisitions achieve several objectives because they were made for shares of our class a common stock  they provide a source of capital  each of the companies have predominantly sound investments  their books of business are focused on ordinary whole life insurance  and particularly in the case of mid american  there are opportunities to expand our usa marketing program 
during  we consolidated certain operating subsidiaries in order to reduce overhead and streamline operations 
lifeline underwriters life insurance company lifeline  a texas domiciled life insurer acquired in  was merged with and into combined underwriters life insurance company combined  a texas domiciled life insurer acquired in the same transaction 
combined and lifeline were acquired for approximately million shares of our class a common stock with an aggregate market value of approximately million 
additionally  two illinois domiciled life insurers were merged excalibur insurance corporation excalibur was merged into central investors life insurance company of illinois cilic and we subsequently changed cilic s name to citizens usa life insurance company cusa 
results of operations the company s operations have historically focused on three areas international life insurance  usa life insurance  and acquisition of other usa life insurance companies 
beginning in with the acquisition of combined  a new area was added  that of usa supplemental accident and health business 
international operations the acceptance of applications for us dollar denominated ordinary whole life insurance from high net worth foreign nationals has been the core business for the company for the past years 
through cica  the company is a significant participant in this market 
our niche allows the company to participate in a marketplace where the policies are typically large face amounts  the premiums are paid annually  the persistency is high compared to us policies  the mortality as good as or better than that experienced in the united states  the caliber of the marketers from whom applications are received for consideration is higher and more professional than that typically seen in the us  and there is no advancing of commissions to producers 
overall  we expect our international operations to continue to expand 
the number of independent marketers contracted has grown over the past few years 
historically  the majority of such business was focused on central and south america 
the company receives applications from virtually every country in those regions 
overall  foreign business made up more than of cica s premium revenues in during late and into  expansion in the pacific rim  particularly in taiwan  was accomplished 
cica has established relationships with a number of marketing organizations in the pacific rim and during received approximately million in submitted premiums from that region 
new submitted premiums for from the international market totaled more than million compared to million in management is pleased with the growth in international production  because several countries from which significant numbers of applications have been received have undergone severe financial crises over the past several years  particularly argentina and venezuela 
these two countries represent more than of the premium income of the company 
during the late s argentina became the largest source of new business for cica  particularly as a new middle class emerged in that country s society 
because of this emerging middle class  cica which has historically only focused on the upper income groups began offering a plan in argentina that was designed for this group that was popularly received 
when the economic crises occurred  the middle class was severely impacted and cica experienced a decrease in new business and an increase in surrenders 
since that time  management has refocused the marketing organizations in this area on the high net worth individuals that have historically been the core group of insureds 
during  surrenders declined 
management is optimistic that in future years production will increase from this area as the economy recovers 
also during  venezuela s economy was dramatically disrupted as the export of oil was halted 
this event caused the volume of new business from that country to drop significantly during the year 
management is optimistic that once this situation is resolved  the volume of new business received from that market should return to previous levels 
total premium income from the international market amounted to  during  compared to  in and  in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the results of the international life segment 
us operations the company s focus historically has been on the international market because of the key advantages described above 
however  throughout the company s history  it has always written us business  and through the acquisition of other us life insurers  has accumulated more than million of annual us life premium 
in  management perceived an opportunity for the company to serve middle income american families through the sale of an ordinary whole life insurance product containing a no load annuity benefit 
this product was introduced in texas in since that time the company has sought the marketing management necessary to build a us sales organization from scratch and to begin to write the product in volume 
after several attempts to bring in such expertise  in early  senior executives in the company s home office staff assumed this new management responsibility 
we have begun emphasizing the development of a sales force comprised primarily of second career sales associates 
recent acquisitions have created opportunities to increase production 
mid american century life insurance company  a missouri domiciled life insurer acquired in the acquisition of mid american alliance corporation  is writing approximately million of annual life premium 
through this and other acquisitions  marketing operations are being conducted in several states 
additionally  through the acquisition of combined underwriters life insurance company combined  the company acquired a unique vehicle for the recruitment and licensure of marketing associates in the state of texas 
combined s charter creates what is known as a stipulated premium company which has the capacity to recruit and train marketers and put them into sales efforts based upon a certificate of authority issued by the company 
this means that a potential recruit can begin to sell insurance up to  per year of premium and face amounts of insurance less than  immediately without the delays mandated by today s agent licensing requirements 
by facilitating a potential marketer s ability to make sales while preparing for his her group standard agent license  the company believes it can generate a larger population of new agents 
marketing associates under contract to combined submitted approximately million of new life premium in additionally  the company has a block of credit life and disability business written through furniture stores in texas  louisiana and arkansas 
this business  sold by furniture stores  is typically single premium  and amounted to  in total us life premium income for amounted to  compared to  in and  in management intends to broaden the portfolio of ordinary whole life products available in the united states to include products similar to those available to overseas clients as well 
accident and health business for more than years  we have had a small block of usa accident and health business 
this block grew through acquisitions in the mid s that brought other books of accident and health business  including some major medical business  however  the acquisition of combined substantially increased both the amount of accident and health business in force  as well as the volume of new business 
the blocks of business acquired in the mid s were initially highly unprofitable 
significant rate increases  coupled with the non renewal of the major medical business  have over time improved the performance of these acquired blocks of business 
the type of accident and health business predominantly written by combined has historically been easier to manage and more profitable than other  more volatile forms of accident and health coverages 
our accident and health book of business acquired in the combined acquisition has not resulted in the type of operating profits we had sought 
skyrocketing costs of health care in the united states have made it difficult to structure rate increases that are adequate for the unpredictable nature of the associated claims liability 
additionally  reinsurance coverage  which the company depends on to minimize its exposure to so called catastrophic claims  has become less available and substantially more expensive in the past year 
also  the administration of accident and health business is burdensome in both costs and manpower 
although virtually all of the major medical business in force for combined and lifeline has been non renewed over the past months  and substantial rate increases imposed on the remaining business  as a whole  the accident and health business has proven to be a strain on profitability 
the ability of state insurance regulators to limit the timing and size of rate increases also impacts the company s ability to stay ahead of the claims curve on certain types of accident and health policies 
due to the failure of rate increases and the non renewal of certain blocks as described above to reach the level of profitability to that experienced on the company s life segments  coupled with the fact that the accident and health business is not the company s core line of business  management determined in late to seek a buyer for the block of accident and health business 
in early  management reached an agreement to transfer all of the in force accident and health business to a texas domiciled reinsurer effective january  the consideration for the transfer  which will initially be accomplished through a coinsurance arrangement until the various state insurance departments can approve an assumption reinsurance agreement  will be a participation in any future profits on the book of business over a year period 
management estimates that this action will result in a decrease of approximately million of annual premium income but should improve long term profitability 
we expect that overhead savings of more than million annually will be achieved through the transfer of this business 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the results of the accident and health segment 
during  premium revenues from accident and health business were  compared to  in and  in during  approximately million of new accident and health premiums were submitted 
the increase from to reflects the acquisition of combined and lifeline 
claims expenses for accident and health business totaled approximately  for   in and  in commission expenses for were  while and totaled  and  respectively 
administration expenses totaled  in   in and  in during and  such expenses were greater than we expected due to a longer and more expensive conversion of the computer systems utilized by combined and lifeline to those used by the company and severance costs related to accrued leave time by employees at those companies 
additionally  due to the high lapsation experienced in the books of business of combined and lifeline  the amortization of the cost of customer relationships acquired related to those acquisitions was accelerated 
during  more than million of such cost was amortized 
consolidated results the following table sets forth the company s net income for periods indicated year ended net income per change from december net income class a b shares previous year statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was adopted by us on january  and changed the accounting for goodwill and intangibles  as discussed below 
had sfas no 
been adopted in  pro forma net income would approximate  
per share for the year ended december  as further discussed below  increases in amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired  and amortization of intangible assets acquired in the first alliance acquisition coupled with losses on the accident and health business related to claims and administration costs contributed to the decreased earnings in total revenues for were  compared to  in  an increase of 
in revenues were  the acquisitions of first alliance and mid american increased revenues by  the acquisitions of combined and lifeline increased revenues by  the increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in new life premiums and a increase in renewal life premiums and a increase in accident and health premiums 
the increase in revenues was due primarily to a increase in new life premiums  a increase in renewal life premiums  a increase in accident and health premiums and a increase in net investment income 
the increase in new life revenues was due to the expansion of countries from which applications have been received  while the increases in accident and health premium relate to combined and lifeline 
premium income increased by from  in to  in the increase was comprised of a  increase in life premiums and annuity and universal life considerations and a  increase in accident and health premiums 
the february acquisition of first alliance and the november acquisition of mid american increased life premiums by  additionally  premiums received from new markets  particularly the pacific rim  boosted revenues during the year 
production of new life insurance premiums by cica increased from to and from to in addition  management initiated a domestic ordinary life sales program in late targeting middle income residents of the us this program s initial results to date have been insignificant  however  with the recent acquisitions  the additional sales forces of the acquisitions should provide expanded sales efforts for our domestic marketing program 
see the discussion of us marketing operations above 
premium income increased by from  in to  in the increase was comprised of a  increase in life premiums and an  increase in accident and health premiums 
the march acquisitions of combined and lifeline increased life premiums by  and accident and health premiums by  management continued to implement significant rate increases in supplemental non cancelable accident and health products and in march and april did not renew approximately million of annual premium related to major medical policies due to increased loss ratios 
as set forth above  the company is moving to cede its entire accident and health premium to another carrier in order to achieve overhead reductions and improve operating results 
this course of action will result in elimination of accident and health premiums 
net investment income increased slightly during to  from  during the increase reflected continued expansion of our asset base that was offset by lower yields available on new investments 
the acquisition of first alliance and mid american increased invested assets by million and investment income by  as interest rates fell  there was a significant amount of call activity on our bond portfolio 
during  more than million of bonds were called or matured 
such call activity was expected given the prevailing interest rates and the nature of the bonds in the company s portfolio 
a majority of new investment activity over the past three years has focused on the acquisition of bonds issued by public agencies that carry the implied full faith and credit of the federal government  such as fnma and fhlmc 
these bonds typically have stated maturities of years  but will carry a call feature at par that varies between three months and two years 
all bonds purchased are at par or at a discount  so that the yield to call will be equal to or greater than the yield to maturity 
by choosing to invest in these securities  the company is exposed to reinvestment risk in the event that interest rates fall for an extended period because the securities will typically be called and the likelihood of increases in market value above par is unlikely because the expectation is that the bond will be called 
such events require reinvestment of the proceeds at levels lower than the yields of the called bonds 
during  such a period occurred  however  in many cases  the company was able to reinvest in bonds at levels at or near those of the called bonds 
these recently purchased bonds offer yields of to basis points above the treasury curve and carry minimal credit risk 
recent scrutiny and concern expressed over the levels of mortgages owned by the various government backed corporations fnma and fhlmc has not resulted in decreases in credit ratings of such entities and management expects to continue to make future investments in these bonds for the company does not believe such declines in available yields will have a material adverse effect on its future operating results because of the strong cash flow available to take advantage of any increases in interest rates 
the results increased compared to the  earned in  such increase reflecting growth in invested assets 
the acquisition of combined and lifeline increased invested assets by million and investment income by  realized gains for amounted to  compared to for and a net loss of  in the increase was primarily due to selective sales made by management of securities from earlier acquisitions that did not meet the company s credit criteria or risk profile 
in we also recognized  from the early extinguishment of a liability  offset by the related amortization of an intangible asset  as a result of the first alliance acquisition 
the change in future policy benefit reserves increased from  in to  in the change in future policy benefit reserves in was  cica s life reserves increased million in  which offset decreases in accident and health reserves 
this is predominantly due to an increase in persistency on the company s overseas business 
these persistency improvements have led to an increase in policy reserves at an accelerated rate compared to the past 
cica s accident and health reserves decreased approximately  because of expected lapsation and non renewal as the company continued to implement significant rate increases 
accident and health policy reserves for combined decreased by approximately million in the non renewal of the major medical block of business accounted for million of the million decrease 
in addition  combined has experienced high lapsation on new accident and health policies issued 
including the policies terminated from the non renewal of the major medical business  the policy count for combined s accident and health policies decreased by approximately during compared to resulting in accident and health policy reserves decreasing by approximately million 
the change in policy reserves for life and annuity policies for combined resulted in a net decrease of approximately  faic  purchased on february   had an increase in policy benefit reserves of approximately  since the date of acquisition 
approximately  of the increase relates to annuities and approximately  relates to life insurance 
policyholder dividends increased to  in  up over dividends of  the amounts increased compared to  in virtually all of cica s overseas policies are participating 
participating policies represented of our business in force at december   although the percentage of participating business has declined from approximately in due to acquisitions in recent years 
claims and surrenders increased from  in to  in in claims and surrenders were  the increase included  related to the operations of first alliance and mid american 
improvements in the persistency of the company s overseas business coupled with the non renewal of a majority of the major medical business accounted for the remaining change 
the increase included  related to the acquisitions of combined and lifeline 
year ended december  death claims    surrender expenses    accident and health benefits    endowments    other policy benefits    total claims and surrenders    death benefits decreased from  in to  in death benefits were  in an improvement in the mortality experience accounted for the results 
the increase was primarily due to the impact of the above discussed acquisitions  which increased such expense by  cica has historically adhered to an underwriting policy which requires thorough medical examinations on all applicants who are foreign residents  except children  regardless of age or face amount of the policy applied for  including x rays and electrocardiograms 
on all policies of  or more  inspection reports are required which detail the background  resources and lifestyle of the applicant 
we have developed numerous contacts with whom our underwriters can validate information contained in applications  medical or inspection reports 
the company also retains only the first  of risk and cedes to other reinsurers the excess 
accident and health benefits increased from  in to  in such claims were  in the increase is directly related to the acquisition of combined  which saw continued increases in claims incurred 
the increase in accident and health benefits is directly related to the acquisition of combined and lifeline discussed above  which generated  in claims 
during  we did not renew approximately million of major medical premiums on the combined book of accident and health business 
in addition  significant rate increases were implemented on the accident and health business remaining in force 
as was discussed above  management has negotiated a reinsurance arrangement to cede off all of the accident and health business in force in endowment benefits increased from  in to  in in  such expenses were  cica has a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount elected by the policyowner 
this endowment is factored into the premium of the policy and is paid annually 
like policy dividends  endowments are factored into the premium and as such the increase should have no adverse impact on profitability 
policy surrenders increased from  in to  in surrenders were  in the increase is directly related to the acquisitions of first alliance and mid american  discussed above  which generated  in surrenders 
the uncertain economic climate in several latin american countries was the primary reason for the increased surrender activity 
the economies in argentina and venezuela in particular were in near depressions during however  management is optimistic about the long term prospects for these countries 
other claim expenses amounted to  in   in and  in these expenses are comprised of supplemental contract benefits  interest on policy funds and assorted other miscellaneous policy benefits 
during  commissions increased to  from  in in  commission expense was  the increase was attributable to the acquisition of first alliance and mid american  whose commissions were  the remainder of the increase was due to the increase in production of new life insurance premiums 
the increase was due to the acquisition of combined and lifeline  whose commissions were  and because of a increased production and related increased issuance of new life policies 
during  the company terminated its arrangement with its international marketing manager and transferred the responsibilities to the home office 
as a result  commission expense declined approximately  and home office marketing and operating expenses increased 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased to  in compared to  in and  in the increase includes  of expenses related to the acquisitions of first alliance and mid american and approximately  related to the annual marketing convention for international producers for and  an expense previously borne by our international marketing manager 
in may  in an attempt to more efficiently manage and communicate with our independent marketing consultants  we canceled our contract with an independent international company that had served as the managing general agent for our international marketing activities since early we no longer pay an overriding commission to this former marketing firm on new business issued internationally but instead directly bear the related costs of all marketing  management and promotional activities 
other factors in the increased expenses relate to the start up costs of the us marketing program  and approximately  was spent in attempting to acquire control of first american capital corporation  a kansas insurance holding company  and on other merger and acquisition activities 
the increase was due in part to the acquisition of combined and lifeline  which added  in additional expenses related to acquisition activities  costs associated with the listing of our class a common stock on the new york stock exchange and other listing fees related to the acquisitions of combined and lifeline 
additionally  as discussed above  the may cancellation of our contract with an independent international company that served as the managing general agent for our international marketing activities increased expenses for the eight months of that the company incurred those costs 
during  we incurred overhead expenses related to acquisition activities combined with expenses incurred to continue to develop the domestic ordinary life sales program 
capitalized deferred policy acquisition costs increased from  in to  in these costs were  in the increase related to the increase in new life production 
the increase included  of deferred policy acquisition costs that have been capitalized by combined and lifeline since their acquisition 
the remainder of the increase related to the increase in new life production 
amortization of these costs was   and  respectively in  and most of the increase related to the increased surrender activity caused by the uncertain economic climate in several latin american countries 
amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired  excess of cost over net assets acquired and other intangibles increased from  in to  in in  such amortization was  the increase relates to the amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired with respect to the acquisitions of combined  lifeline  first alliance and mid american that amounted to  and  related to amortization of an intangible asset 
the increase relates to the amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired with respect to the acquisition of combined and lifeline that amounted to  in that more than offset our adoption of the new financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting statement where amortization of goodwill and other intangibles ceased since management determined that these intangibles have an indefinite life 
our analysis of goodwill and other intangibles indicated that there was no impairment as of december  and december  the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amounted to  for the year ended december  during  the company amended tax returns related to prior years resulting in refunds that reduced current income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources stockholders equity increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase was attributable to  and  respectively  of class a common stock issued for the acquisition of first alliance and mid american  net income of  earned in and unrealized gains  net of tax  decreased by  as of december  compared to december  decreases in the market value of our bond portfolio caused by lower bond prices resulted in the decrease in unrealized gains 
we paid a stock dividend on december  to holders of record as of december  a similar dividend was paid on june  both dividends were paid using class a and b shares that were previously authorized but unissued 
the dividends had the effect of transferring  and  respectively  in and from retained earnings to our common stock and treasury stock 
the company has benefited from significant cash provided by operations 
in  such cash was more than million  while in and  respectively  cash provided by operations was million and million 
this cash flow permits the company to expand its life insurance activities and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise invested assets increased to  at december  from  at year end  an increase of 
the acquisition of first alliance and mid american discussed above were the primary reasons for the increase adding million to invested assets 
in addition  million of excess cash was invested in fixed maturities as interest rates began to gradually increase in late increases in fixed maturities available for sale  fixed maturities held to maturity and policy loans were the primary categories of invested assets that increased 
fixed maturities are categorized into two classifications fixed maturities held to maturity  which are valued at amortized cost  and fixed maturities available for sale which are valued at fair value 
fixed maturities available for sale and fixed maturities held to maturity were and  respectively  of invested assets at december  fixed maturities held to maturity  amounting to  at december   consist of us treasury and us government agency securities 
management has the intent and believes we have the ability to hold the securities to maturity 
see the discussion of investment income above for further disclosure regarding investment strategy and philosophy 
policy loans comprised of invested assets at december  compared to at december  these loans  which are secured by the underlying policy values  have yields ranging from to percent and maturities that are related to the maturity or termination of the applicable policies 
management believes that we maintain adequate liquidity despite the uncertain maturities of these loans 
our mortgage loan portfolio  which constituted and of invested assets at december   and december   respectively  has historically been comprised primarily of seasoned small residential loans in texas and colorado 
management established a reserve of  at december   and december   approximately to of the mortgage portfolio s balance to cover potential unforeseen losses in our mortgage portfolio 
at december   no loans were past due for more than days 
our cash balances at our primary depositories were significantly in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation coverage at december  and management monitors the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss 
management does not believe we are at significant risk for such a loss 
during  we intend to continue to utilize callable securities issued by federal agencies as cash management tools to minimize excess cash balances and enhance returns 
during  the company transferred its primary banking relationship from jp morgan chase to regions bank 
in the wake of recent bankruptcy filings by large corporations  concern has been raised regarding the use of certain off balance sheet special purpose entities such as partnerships to hedge or conceal losses related to investment activity 
we do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles 
nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engage in speculative activities of any description  and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions 
our subsidiary  cica  owned  shares of our class a common stock at december   and  shares at december  in our consolidated financial statements  the shares owned by cica are combined with the other treasury shares and the aggregate treasury shares are reported at cost in conformity with us gaap 
we have a profit sharing plan designed to provide a retirement program for the exclusive benefit of our eligible employees 
the plan is designed to comply with the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
our board of directors determines if a contribution will be made and the amount to be made 
the contribution  if any  is allocated based upon the total number of employees participating in the plan and their years of service 
we made contributions of  in   in  and  in the profit sharing plan had net assets of  as of december    as of december  and  as of december  the naic has established minimum capital requirements in the form of risk based capital rbc 
risk based capital factors the type of business written by an insurance company  the quality of its assets  and various other factors into account to develop a minimum level of capital called authorized control level risk based capital and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles  plus certain investment reserves 
should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk based capital fall below  a series of actions by the affected company would begin 
at december   all of the company s insurance subsidiaries were above required minimum levels 
effective january   the naic implemented codified rules for statutory accounting 
these rules were approved and implemented by each state in which all of our insurance subsidiaries operations are domiciled 
cica is domiciled in colorado  combined is domiciled in texas  faic in kentucky  maclic in missouri  saic in arkansas and cusa in illinois 
cica follows certain colorado state laws that differ from naic s codified rules 
the primary difference between the colorado statutes and the codified rules involve the establishment of a liability for future policy dividends payable 
under codification such reserve is mandated  however  colorado has an exception if the difference between the premium charged and the mortality factor included in the premium on participating policies exceeds the reserve that would be established 
such is the case for cica 
as a result  cica did not establish a reserve of approximately million in its statutory financial statements as of and for the year ended december  or december  texas  illinois  kentucky  missouri and arkansas codified rules must be followed unless the commissioner of insurance permits specific practices that differ from codified rules 
none of our insurance subsidiaries has requested any permission to deviate from naic codified rules 
during  we engaged in discussions with the investment banking community regarding raising additional equity capital 
should we decide to pursue equity capital  the purpose would be to utilize the proceeds to pursue acquisitions 
management believes the company has sufficient capital for its long term operating needs  however  management may pursue additional equity capital to finance larger acquisitions 
during early  the company s shareholders approved amendments to the articles of incorporation increasing the number of authorized class a and class b shares and authorizing preferred stock that could be issued upon approval of the board of directors 
the company received a commitment from regions bank for a million credit facility for use in acquisitions in late definitive documents are expected to be signed during march the company has historically avoided the incurrence of significant amounts of debt  however  this facility should allow management to pursue larger acquisitions 
if a decision is made to utilize the facility in conjunction with a transaction  management intends to view the debt as a bridge facility 
before drawing on the debt  management expects to develop a strategy designed to retire the debt without restricting growth 
during the third quarter of  management determined to transfer the hardware platform that the company s legacy computer system operates on from the wang environment to an ibm mainframe environment 
this decision was prompted by the need to migrate to hardware that is widely available and supported 
delivery of the new hardware occurred in october  and management estimates that the transition will take to months 
the company s existing data processing staff will oversee the conversion 
the overall cost of the new hardware was less than million 
management expects to achieve an environment that the company can operate in for many years to come through this move 
the sarbanes oxley act of the act established sweeping new guidelines for corporate governance 
subsequently  the new york stock exchange adopted new rules that relate to such matters as the composition of listed companies boards of directors and various committees thereof  the need to adopt specific policies as well as the establishment of a code of ethics 
the company s board of directors  compensation committee and audit committee were already configured in such a way as to comply with the act 
citizens has operated under a principles  purposes  philosophy and beliefs for numerous years that sets forth the manner in which the company and its officers  directors and employees are expected to function 
however  the board of directors has implemented a formal code of ethics  including an insider trading policy  applicable to all officers  directors and employees 
additionally  the act imposes a duty upon public companies to document and test all internal controls and have such audited by independent auditors 
the company has begun the process of documenting all such control procedures and expects to complete the documentation and testing in the company has committed to the following contractual obligations as of december  with the payments due by the period indicated below contractual less than to more than obligation total year years years operating leases    other    total    critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows policy liabilities future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields  dividends on participating business  mortality and withdrawals based upon our industry experience 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves 
management s judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation 
we continue to use the original assumptions including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits the lock in concept unless a premium deficiency exists 
management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency does not exist 
management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of and for the years ended december   and are based upon assumptions  including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation  that do not warrant revision 
the relative stability of these assumptions and management s analysis is discussed below 
in table ii in item  the ratio of lapses and surrenders to mean life insurance in force has varied between to for three of the past five years  with being impacted by the acquisition of first alliance 
the ratios of and relate to surrenders caused by the current uncertain economic conditions in several latin american countries 
in addition  the ratio of includes first alliance surrenders and lapses of approximately million approximately of the total 
after review of the surrender and lapse detailed information  management does not believe the and increases reflect a negative trend in lapses and surrender activity but rather an aberration in the historical experience and no adjustment to persistency and lapsation assumptions are needed in the computation of future policy benefit reserves 
management believes that our conservation program whereby policyholders that are considering surrendering their policies are informed and counseled about the benefits of their policies  should return surrenders to our historical levels 
table iv in item above  illustrates that during the past five years the ratio of commissions  underwriting and operating expenses to insurance premiums has ranged from to and the ratio of commissions  underwriting and operating expenses  policy reserves increases  policyholder benefits and dividends to policyholders to insurance premiums has ranged from to 
table viii also shows that the ratio of net investment income to mean amount of invested assets has varied from through to 
the represents the impact of the low interest environment 
as set forth above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  death benefits for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively with  of the increase in death benefits related to the acquisitions of combined and lifeline and  of the increase in death benefits related to the acquisitions of first alliance and mid american 
deferred policy acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions and policy issuance  underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new business  are deferred 
these deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance 
the factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period 
the factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation 
the factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value  provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors 
inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred  the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
over of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions 
the remaining are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business 
those costs generally included costs related to the production  underwriting and issuance of new business 
use of the factor method  as discussed above  limits the amount of unamortized deferred policy acquisition costs to its estimated realizable value provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors and results in amortization amounts such that policies that lapse or surrender during the period are no longer included in the ending deferred policy acquisition cost balance 
a recoverability test that considers among other things  actual experience and projected future experience  is performed at least annually by third party actuarial consultants 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit net premium less percent of premium expense for the next years 
the available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated 
the deferred policy acquisition costs are then amortized over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions 
the two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early deferred policy acquisition recoverability period 
the two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of the aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs 
based upon the analysis done to only capitalize expenses that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business  utilization of the factor method and extensive  annual recoverability testing  management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization as of and for the years ended december   and limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value 
valuation of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities at december   investments in fixed maturity and equity securities were and  respectively  of total investments 
approximately of our fixed maturities were classified as available for sale securities at december  with the remaining classified as held to maturity securities based upon our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
all equity securities at december  are classified as available for sale securities 
we have no fixed maturity or equity securities that are classified as trading securities at december  additionally  at december   of our fixed maturity securities are invested in us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies  including us government guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
all of these securities are backed by or bear the implied full faith and credit of the us government 
we evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly 
a decline in the fair value of any fixed maturity or equity security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings resulting in the establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in the fair value of the fixed maturity or equity security 
based upon our emphasis of investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies  including us government guaranteed mortgage backed securities and callable instruments issued by us government agencies and its analysis whether any declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other than temporary  management believes that our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities at december  are not impaired and no other than temporary losses need to be recorded 
the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available for sale amounted to  as of december  of the total gross unrealized loss   of the fixed maturities available for sale have been in a continuous unrealized loss situation for more than months and  have been in a continuous unrealized loss situation for less than months 
the fixed maturities available for sale in a gross unrealized loss situation for more than months relate to two fixed maturities available for sale issued by corporations and two callable instruments issued by us government agencies 
these securities are being closely monitored by the company to determine if the unrealized loss as of december  indicates that there is a loss other than temporary 
as of december   the company has determined that there is no need to establish a new cost basis for these two securities since a loss has not occurred 
approximately  of the fixed maturities available for sale that have been in a continuous unrealized loss situation for less than months are investments in callable instruments issued by us government agencies 
these fixed maturities available for sale are backed by the full faith and credit of the us or bear the implied full faith and credit of the us government 
management believes it is remote that unrealized losses on these instruments will result in realized losses since the company has the intent and believes it has the ability to hold these securities to the call date or maturity date 
the remaining  of fixed maturities available for sale that have been in a continuous unrealized loss situation for less than months are investments in fixed maturities available for sale issued by corporations 
the investments in callable instruments issued by us government agencies and in fixed maturities available for sale of corporations that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than months are primarily in an unrealized loss position because their coupon interest rate was less than the prevailing market interest rates as of december  as of december   the company has determined that there is no need to establish a new cost basis for these debt securities that have been in a continuous loss situation for less than months since a loss has not occurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general the nature of our business exposes us to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss that may occur when changes in interest rates and public equity prices adversely affect the value of our invested assets 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk exposure 
substantial and sustained increases and decreases in market interest rates can affect the market value of our investments 
the market value of our fixed maturity  mortgage loan portfolio and policy loans generally increases when interest rates decrease  and decreases when interest rates increase 
market risk related to interest rates our exposure to interest rate changes results from our significant holdings of fixed maturity investments  mortgage loans on real estate and policy loans  all of which comprised almost of our investment portfolio as of december  these investments are mainly exposed to changes in treasury rates 
our fixed maturities investments include us government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  and corporate bonds 
approximately of the fixed maturities we owned at december  are instruments of the united states government or are backed by us government agencies or private corporations carrying the implied full faith and credit backing of the us government 
to manage interest rate risk  we perform periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our investments and liabilities 
we assess interest rate sensitivity with respect to our available for sale fixed maturities investments using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point shifts in the prevailing interest rates 
the following tables set forth the potential amount of unrealized gains losses that could be caused by basis point upward and downward shifts on our available for sale fixed maturities investments as of the dates indicated decreases in interest rates basis basis basis points points points december     december     increases in interest rates basis basis basis points points points december     december     while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
due to the composition of our book of insurance business  we believe it is unlikely that we would encounter large surrender activity due an interest rate increase that would force us to dispose of our fixed maturities at a loss 
there are no fixed maturities or other investments that we classify as trading instruments 
at december  and  there were no investments in derivative instruments 
market risk related to equity prices changes in the level or volatility of equity prices affect the value equity securities we hold as investments 
however  our equity investments portfolio was less than of our total investments at december  thus  we believe that significant decreases in the equity markets would have an immaterial impact on our total investment portfolio
