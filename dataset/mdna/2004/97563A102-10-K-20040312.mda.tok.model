meristar has since merged with and become interstate hotels resorts  inc interstate 
the acquisition included leasehold interests for wholly owned hotels and two joint venture hotels 
the total consideration of approximately million  to acquire the leasehold interests for hotels from interstate  was based upon a million purchase price for the leasehold interests  adjusted in part for accrued interest and related expenses totaling approximately million  and million of working capital 
the total acquisition cost  net of working capital  of million  was expensed in the second quarter of in addition  a deferred tax benefit of million was recognized in the second quarter of  resulting from the timing difference of the million payment for financial reporting purposes versus tax purposes

the acquisition of the leasehold interests entitles barclay to retain the operating profits or losses from the related hotels  which previously accrued to interstate under the leases and gives the company i more control over the operations of these hotels  ii the benefits from any operating margin improvements and risk of any operating margin deterioration at these hotels  and iii more flexibility  in that these hotels are no longer encumbered by long term leases with unrelated third parties that are difficult to amend and expensive to terminate

off balance sheet arrangements the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of its ownership interest in its joint venture with charlesbank 
for a further discussion of this joint venture  and its effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flow  see critical accounting policies  recently issued accounting standards and liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts and notes receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its hotel guests  mezzanine loan borrowers  and other borrowers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its hotel guests  mezzanine loan borrowers  or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for joint ventures as of december  the company had a percent ownership interest in its charlesbank joint venture  which in turn owned an percent ownership interest in its wcc project company llc joint venture  a percent ownership interest in one of its joint ventures with regent  a percent interest in the other joint venture with regent  a percent ownership interest in its marsh landing joint venture  and a percent interest in its chapel hill joint venture 
the wcc project company llc joint venture owned three hotels  and the two regent joint ventures and the marsh landing joint venture each owned one hotel 
the chapel hill joint venture owned one hotel which is currently under construction and expected to open in the third quarter of per the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  as of december   the company determined that the charlesbank joint venture does not have to be consolidated and therefore  the company used the equity method to recognize its share of net income or loss from this joint venture during and adjusted the carrying value of its investment accordingly 
accordingly  the joint ventures assets  liabilities  and equity are not recorded on the company s balance sheet as of december  as of december   for three of its joint ventures created prior to january   the company determined that they are considered to be vies and the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary 
these include the two regent joint ventures and the marsh landing joint venture 
therefore  per the provisions of fin  the company has consolidated the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures into its consolidated balance sheet as of december  per fin  for these three joint ventures  the company will not consolidate the results of operations until the first quarter of the chapel hill joint venture was created in august therefore  per fin  the company has consolidated the joint venture s assets  liabilities  and results of operations beginning with the third quarter accounting for long lived assets the company evaluates the potential impairment of its individual long lived assets  principally its wholly owned hotel properties and the hotel properties in which it owns an interest through joint ventures in accordance with fasb no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired  such that the company s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  together with its estimate of an anticipated liquidation amount  would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the hotel property  or when the company classifies a property as held for sale and the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
the company considers many factors and makes certain subjective assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to  general market and economic conditions  operating results over the past several years  the performance of similar properties in the same market and expected future operating results based on a variety of assumptions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if the company s assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and anticipated liquidation amounts are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
further  the company currently owns certain hotels for which the carrying value exceeds current market value 
the company does not believe an impairment charge for these hotels is appropriate since the company s forecast of future undiscounted cash flows  including an anticipated liquidation amount  exceeds the current carrying value 
however  should the company approve of a plan to sell these properties  an impairment charge would be required 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
because of expected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset as of december  should our estimate of future taxable income be less than expected  and or our tax planning strategy not be carried out as planned  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period such determination was made 
results of operations due to the acquisition of the leasehold interests for hotels from interstate on july   and the assumption of the leasehold interests for two hotels from intercontinental group on july   the results of operations for the years ended december   december   and december  do not result in a meaningful comparison

therefore  included a full year of percentage lease revenue for one hotel and six months of percentage lease revenue for one hotel 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased from  in to  in the decline is primarily due to a decrease in third party development and purchasing fees related to our evanston joint venture hotel and tampa  fl hilton garden inn for which we have provided mezzanine financing 
interest and other income increased from  in to  in this increase was driven primarily by interest income earned on our mezzanine loan provided for the baltimore hampton inn suites for twelve months in versus one month in expenses rooms  food and beverage  other operating departments expenses the increase in these hotel expenses from to  and from to  is a result of the acquisition of the leasehold interests from interstate and intercontinental group

percentage lease expense beginning july   this expense represented the lease expense barclay  as lessee  paid to third party owners of two joint venture hotels  including the evanston  il hilton garden inn and the ponte vedra  fl hampton inn 
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased from  in to  in and increased to  in the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower expenses associated with mezzanine financing  acquisition and development activities
