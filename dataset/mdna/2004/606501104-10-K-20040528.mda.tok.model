controls and procedures  as well as other written and oral statements made or incorporated by reference from time to time by us and our representatives in other reports  filings with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec  press releases  conferences  or otherwise  may be deemed to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
this information includes  without limitation  statements concerning our future financial position and results of operations  planned capital expenditures  business strategy and other plans for future operations  the future mix of revenues and business  commitments and contingent liabilities  and future demand for our services and predicted improvement in energy industry and seismic service industry conditions 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  and similar expressions  as they relate to the company and our management  identify forward looking statements 
the actual results of future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth below and elsewhere within this annual report on form k 
demand for land based seismic data not assured demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land and transition zone seismic data acquisition worldwide  and especially in north america 
loss of significant customers will adversely affect us we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  the single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 

table of contents because our customer base is relatively small  the loss of one or more customers for any reason could adversely affect our results of operations 
significant defaults of past due customer accounts would adversely affect our results of operations on january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and notes receivable of which million was over days past due 
at january   we had an allowance of million to cover losses in our receivable balances 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
international economic and political instability could adversely our results of operations our results of operations are dependent upon the current political and economic climate of several international countries in which our customers either operate or are located 
international sources including canada accounted for approximately of our revenues in the fiscal year ended january  since the majority of our lease and sales contracts with our customers are denominated in us  australian and canadian dollars  there is little risk of economic as opposed to accounting loss from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
however  our internationally sourced revenues are still subject to the risk of currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars  taxation policies  and expropriation  as well as to political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other hazards 
foreign currency exchange rates have increasingly materially affected our results of operations for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of the canadian and australian subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
income statement items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has become material because of the significant amount of equipment assigned to our canadian operations and the significant fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate over the last few years 
we must continually obtain additional lease contracts our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of three to nine months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lessees are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other lessees after the termination of the original leases  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
dependence on key personnel our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
mr 
mitcham s employment agreement is automatically renewed on a year to year basis until terminated by either party giving days notice prior to the end of the current term subject to earlier termination on certain stated events 
the agreement prohibits mr 
mitcham from engaging in any business activities that are competitive with our business and from diverting any of our customers to a competitor for two years after the termination of his employment 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham could have a material adverse effect on us 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant 
table of contents competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment  and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers 
weather conditions cause seasonal results the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada from november through march 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
competition we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers  data acquisition contractors and oil and gas exploration companies that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than us 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenue from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we are also aware of several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing 
we believe that our competitors  in general  have neither as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as we do  or similar exclusive lease referral agreements with suppliers 
competition exists to a lesser extent from seismic data acquisition contractors that may lease equipment that is temporarily idle 
volatile stock prices and no payment of dividends due to recent energy industry conditions  energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been extremely volatile 
such stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing if such financing is ever needed 
we have historically not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
possible adverse effect of anti takeover provisions  potential issuance of preferred stock certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business corporation act may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with such preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock 
although we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future 
limitation on directors liability our articles of incorporation provide  as permitted by governing texas law  that a director of the company shall not be personally liable to the company or its shareholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director  with certain exceptions 
these provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on behalf of the company against a director

seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews 
an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  therefore  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
due to our unique position as the largest independent lessor of seismic equipment  we are privy to information about future projects from many data acquisition contractors 
our analysis of the available information is that land based data acquisition activity is increasing 
we believe that this increase is being driven by historically high world oil and north american natural gas prices  combined with the maturation of the world s hydrocarbon producing basins 
the future direction and magnitude of changes in seismic data acquisition activity levels will continue to be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices 
we lease and sell seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land and transition zone seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offer technical support during the lease term 
the majority of all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout south east asia and australia 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from foreign customers totaled million  million and million  which is  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian and canadian dollars 

table of contents seasonality seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
our lease revenue is seasonal  especially in canada  where a significant percentage of seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from november through march 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other equipment because of the unstable terrain 
this seasonal leasing activity by our canadian customers has historically resulted in increased lease revenues in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
results of operations during fiscal  our results of operations were affected by several significant factors 
our revenues increased million  reflecting significant increases in both leasing and sales from the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenues is attributable to several factors 
one significant factor is the inclusion of the results of sap for the whole fiscal year versus two months in the prior year  which accounted for approximately million of the current year increase  primarily from sales of hydrographic and oceanographic equipment 
additionally  during the fiscal year  we expanded our marine seismic business  which resulted in the execution of several high dollar rental contracts and several marine sales transactions having an aggregate value of million 
also contributing to our increase in fiscal revenues is a general increase in demand for short term rentals in the united states from some of our seismic contractor customers 
we believe that this increased demand resulted from the decision by a major contractor to cease land based operations in north america  which benefited these customers due to the reduced level of competition 
our fixed and variable costs are an important factor affecting our results of operations 
due to the size and age of our seismic equipment lease pool  depreciation expense is our single largest expense item  which amounted to million for fiscal this expense will vary between periods based on acquisitions of new equipment and sales of equipment with remaining depreciable life 
our general and administrative expenses remained fairly level over the past three fiscal years  except for fiscal  which included a full year of expenses related to sap totaling million 
direct cost of seismic leasing is a variable expense that fluctuates with our equipment leasing revenues 
the main components of this cost are freight  sublease expenses and repairs and maintenance  to the extent that repairs performed are normal wear and tear and not billable to the lease customer 
another significant factor that affected our results of operations for fiscal was currency translation adjustments 
the decline in value of the united states dollar relative to the canadian dollar resulted in an increase in both revenues and expenses from our canadian subsidiary 
the result was that our net loss was million greater than it would have been had the results from our canadian operations been translated at the average exchange rate that prevailed in fiscal revenues for fiscal  consolidated revenues increased million  or  to million from fiscal  driven by increases in both leasing and sales activity during the year 
consolidated revenues for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  from fiscal due mainly to the loss of three significant customers that ceased operations in fiscal during fiscal  leasing revenues increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in our north american revenues  our expanding marine seismic business  our first large rental contract in the south east asia market  and the inclusion of the operations of sap  which we acquired in december sap s revenues for fiscal were approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing fiscal revenues by million from fiscal levels 
during fiscal  leasing revenues decreased primarily due to the business decline of three of our customers in fiscal foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing fiscal revenues by approximately  from fiscal levels 

table of contents during fiscal  we executed several high dollar lease contracts with a customer in south america that attributed to our increase in revenues for the year 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing fiscal revenues by approximately  from fiscal levels 
included in fiscal revenues is commission income of million 
this commission income was earned by mitcham canada pursuant to the sercel sales agreement  was based on direct sales by sercel to various customers and was recognized when sercel paid the applicable commission to us 
seismic equipment sales for fiscal were million as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales for the fiscal years ended january   and was million  million and million  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales will vary significantly between periods due to the mix of sales revenue between new seismic equipment versus sales of depreciated seismic equipment being sold from our lease pool 
costs and expenses for fiscal  depreciation expense was million  which is million  or  lower than fiscal depreciation expense 
during fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million 
this amount reflects a decrease of million  or  from the fiscal amount 
for fiscal  foreign currency translation rates had the effect of increasing depreciation expense by million from the fiscal amount 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing depreciation expense for fiscal by  from the fiscal amount 
in fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million  which reflected a million  or  increase above the fiscal amount 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing depreciation expense for fiscal by  from the fiscal amount 
the decrease in fiscal and fiscal depreciation expense is largely because certain equipment reached the end of its depreciable life during each of those years  coupled with the sales of assets with remaining depreciable life 
the increase in depreciation expense during fiscal was primarily a result of our replacement of older  fully depreciated seismic equipment with new  state of the art technology 
direct costs for fiscal were million  which was approximately million greater than fiscal direct costs 
the increase is largely attributable to an increase in sublease expenses of  for fiscal  direct costs totaled million  representing a decrease of million from the fiscal amount of million 
this decrease is attributable to the significant decrease in leasing activity during the fiscal year 
specifically  the decrease is mainly attributable to decreases in freight  equipment repairs and sublease expenses of   and  respectively 
for fiscal  our direct costs totaled approximately million  for an increase of  over the fiscal amount 
this increase is a result of the significant increase in equipment leasing activity during the year 
the increase is attributable to increases in freight and equipment repairs of  and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment expenses of  direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  equipment repairs and sublease expense 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal totaled million  or million greater than fiscal expenses of million 
this increase is due to the inclusion of the results of operations of sap for a full year  which had general and administrative expenses totaling million greater than the prior year 
for the fiscal year ended january   our general and administrative expenses totaled million  or 
million above those of fiscal  which is entirely attributable to the inclusion of sap 
for the fiscal year ended january   our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million  or million above those of fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in insurance  professional fees and debt acquisition costs  partially offset by a decrease in travel  rent and customer relation expenses 
during fiscal  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of  compared to a non cash net benefit for doubtful accounts in the amount of million recorded in fiscal of this net benefit  approximately million represents recoveries of receivables written off in the prior fiscal year 
the recovery was in the form of seismic equipment that we accepted as a settlement of trade receivables owed to 
table of contents us by a former customer  who ceased operations that year 
the remaining million benefit resulted from our collecting an outstanding note receivable that had been fully reserved in prior fiscal years due to the uncertainty of collection 
once the funds were collected  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts and recorded the net benefit 
our provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal was approximately million 
in fiscal  we had reserved or written off approximately million in trade and note receivables related to three customers who advised us they were ceasing operations and did not have the resources to pay their outstanding obligations to us 
at january  and  we had past due trade accounts and note receivables in the approximate amount of million and million  respectively 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable amounted to million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million against assets held for sale as a result of our decision to sell the operating assets of dsi 
no such charge was recorded in fiscal or for fiscal  we recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the amount of million  compared to a net loss from continuing operations for fiscal and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal and nil in liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had net working capital of approximately million as compared to net working capital of million at january  historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our principal sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and proceeds from sales of lease pool equipment 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended january  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million and net cash provided by operating activities of million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  was million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended january  of million and net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal year during fiscal  we liquidated temporary investments in marketable securities of approximately million to fund a portion of our capital expenditure program 
the temporary investments were originally made with surplus cash generated in prior fiscal years  which were invested in marketable securities until such time as the funds were needed 
we are committed to purchase million of land data acquisition equipment by december   under the sercel agreement 
we expect that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet this commitment 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year totaled approximately million as compared to capital expenditures of million for fiscal capital expenditures of million in fiscal were mainly comprised of purchases of sercel ul seismic data recording equipment pursuant to the sercel agreement 
the ul equipment is the latest generation equipment available to the market 
our fiscal and capital expenditures were made to fulfill specific lease contracts 
subsequent to january   we negotiated and issued credits and other future customer enhancements with certain canadian leasing customers totaling  as of january   we had  allocated to these matters in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
after recording these credits  that allocation was no longer necessary and was reversed out of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the impact was a  net increase in our net loss recorded at january  at january   we had trade accounts and notes receivable of million that were more than days past due 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  which management believes is sufficient to cover any losses in our trade accounts receivable and notes receivable 

table of contents in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance 
due to the uncertainty of collection  we do not recognize the interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
in most cases where we have a chronic collection problem with a particular customer  future business is done on a prepayment basis or if additional credit is extended  revenues are not recognized until collected 
although the extension of repayment terms on open accounts receivables temporarily reduces our cash flow from operations  we believe that this practice is necessary in light of seismic industry conditions and that it has not adversely affected our ability to conduct routine business 
additionally  we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
unless there is a question as to whether an account is collectible  the sales revenue and cost of goods sold is recognized at the transfer of title of the equipment 
in february  we obtained an million term loan with first victoria national bank  the remaining principal balance of which was approximately million at january  the loan is payable in forty eight equal installments of  and bears interest at the rate of prime plus 
the loan is secured by lease pool equipment and all proceeds from lease pool equipment leases and sales 
we paid for our million capital expenditure in in part by three separate short term note agreements with three seismic equipment manufacturers related to the purchase of equipment for our lease pool 
the aggregate amount financed by the manufacturers was million  of which million remains unpaid as of january  the notes call for monthly payments aggregating approximately  and bear interest ranging from to 
all three notes have month repayment terms and mature during fiscal on march   we obtained a million revolving loan agreement and credit line with first victoria national bank 
the line allows us to borrow funds to purchase equipment at any time as necessary and is secured by the equipment purchased and any leases on that equipment 
interest is payable monthly at prime plus 
principal is due on each note after six months  after nine months and the remaining after a year from the date of each note 
the last date that advances can be made is june  we have not yet borrowed any funds available under this line 
although we have sufficient cash to meet known commitments and no current plan to draw down any amount  this credit line gives us the financial flexibility to acquire equipment for resale and for lease as needed on short notice to take advantage of strategic opportunities regardless of our cash position at the time 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of  or an average cost of per share 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal at the present time  we believe that cash on hand and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital and liquidity needs over the next months 
however  should demand warrant  we may pursue additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt and equipment notes payable operating leases equipment purchase obligations total 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and useful lives of our lease pool assets and their valuation 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease until there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
commission income is recognized once it has been paid to us 
we do not enter into leases with imbedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease contract  the lessee is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding fair wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from the equipment sales upon transfer of title 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts periodically as conditions warrant based on whether such receivables are collectible 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance and do not recognize interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
long lived assets we carry property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from three to seven years 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the leases 
we review our long lived assets for impairment at each reporting date 
if our assessment of the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the fair market value in accordance with the applicable accounting regulations  we record an impairment charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the sale of dsi s operating assets 
income taxes we account for our taxes under the liability method  whereby we recognize  on a current and long term basis  deferred tax assets and liabilities which represent differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established when uncertainty exists as to the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets 
as of january  and  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively 
as we believe it is not assured that these net deferred tax assets will be realized  we have provided valuation allowances of million and million at january  and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars 
we typically denominate the majority of our lease and sales contracts in us  canadian and australian dollars to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
since the majority of our lease and sales contracts with our customers are denominated in us and canadian dollars  there is little risk of economic as opposed to accounting loss from fluctuations in foreign currencies
