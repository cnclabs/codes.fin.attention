critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in the company s results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company believes the critical accounting policies described below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements revenue recognition 
the company adheres to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the staff of the securities and exchange commission the sec as a revision to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
while the wording of sab has revised the original sab  revenue recognition  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab under sab  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  the majority of the company s sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  are recognized upon receipt of the product by the customer 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  the company takes title to the products sold upon shipment  bears credit risk  and bears inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  these revenues are recognized at gross sales amounts 
certain software products and extended warranties that the company sells for which the company is not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period  based on the nature of the contract  at the net amount retained by the company  with no cost of goods sold 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  coupon redemptions and credit card chargebacks 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts  coupon redemptions and credit card chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon estimates of future collection 
the company extends credit to its customers based upon an evaluation of each customer s financial condition and credit history  and generally does not require collateral 
the company regularly evaluates its customers financial condition and credit history in determining the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company also maintains an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables which arise from vendor rebate programs  price protections and other promotions 
the company determines the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance may be required 
reserve for inventory obsolescence 
the company maintains allowances for the valuation of its inventory by estimating the obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between inventory cost and market value determined by general market conditions  nature  age and type of each product 
the company regularly evaluates the adequacy of its inventory reserve 
if the inventory reserve subsequently proves insufficient  additional inventory write downs may be required 
coupon redemption rate estimates 
the company accrues monthly expense related to promotional coupon rebates based upon the quantity of eligible orders transacted during the period and the estimated redemption rate 
the estimated expense is accrued and presented as a reduction of net sales 
the estimated redemption rates used to calculate the accrued coupon expense and related coupon liability are based upon historical redemption experience rates for similar products or coupon amounts 
estimated redemption rates and the related coupon expense and liability are regularly adjusted as actual coupon redemptions for the program are processed 
if estimated redemption rates are greater than anticipated  additional expense may be incurred 
deferred advertising revenue and costs 
the company produces and circulates catalogs at various dates throughout the year and receives market development funds and co op advertising funds from vendors included in each catalog 
these funds are recognized based on sales generated over the life of the catalog  approximately eight weeks  as an offset to cost of sales in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
the costs of developing  producing and circulating each catalog are deferred and charged to advertising expense at the same rate as the co op revenue based on the life of the catalog 
deferred advertising revenue is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  offset by deferred advertising costs  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  information derived from the company s consolidated statement of operations expressed as a percentage of sales

in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of business enterprises variable interest entities to which the usual condition ownership of a majority voting interest of consolidation does not apply 
the interpretation focuses on financial interests that indicate control 
it concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
variable interests are rights and obligations that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the values of the variable interest entity s assets and liabilities 
variable interests may arise from financial instruments  service contracts  nonvoting ownership interests and other arrangements 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary

in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after september  adoption of sfas did not materially affect the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and long term debt 
at march   the carrying values of the company s financial instruments approximated their fair values based on current market prices and rates 
the company has exposure to the risks of fluctuating interest rates on its line of credit 
the variable interest rate on the line of credit is tied to the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate at the discretion of the company 
if the variable rate on the line of credit changes  the company may be required to pay more interest 
the company believes that the effect of any change in interest rates will not be material to the company s financial position 
it is the company s policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments  and the company does not have any significant foreign currency exposure 
therefore  the company did not have significant overall currency exposure as of december
