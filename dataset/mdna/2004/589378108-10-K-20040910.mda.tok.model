item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors that may affect future results in this report  as well as oral statements made by us  phrases that are prefaced with the words may  will  expect  anticipate  continue  estimate  project  intend  designed and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements regarding events  conditions and financial trends that may affect our future plans of operations  business strategy  results of operations and financial position 
these statements are based on our current expectations and estimates as to prospective events and circumstances about which we can give no firm assurance 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made  and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
as it is not possible to predict every new factor that may emerge  forward looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results 
these forward looking statements  like any forward looking statements  involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or anticipated 
such risks and uncertainties include certain factors identified in the following discussion as well as the risk factors appearing under the caption factors that may affect future results in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we design  manufacture and market high performance  real time digital signal and image processing computer systems that transform sensor generated data into information which can be displayed as images for human interpretation or be subjected to additional computer analysis 
these multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable  allowing them to accommodate several microprocessor types and to scale from a few to hundreds of microprocessors within a single system 
during the past several years  the majority of our revenue has been generated from sales of our products to the deg market  generally for use in intelligence gathering electronic warfare systems 
our activities in this area have focused on the proof of concept  development and deployment of advanced military applications in radar  sonar and airborne surveillance 
imaging and visualization solutions is another primary market that we currently serve 
our computer systems are embedded in magnetic resonance imaging mri  computed tomography ct  positron emission tomography pet  and digital x ray machines 
our remaining revenues are derived from computer systems used in such commercial oem solutions as semiconductor photomask generation  wafer inspection  baggage scanning  seismic analysis and development of new reticle inspection and wafer inspection systems 
during fiscal year  revenues increased by million compared to fiscal  principally as a result of a million increase in oem solutions revenues primarily from semiconductor applications as well as a million increase in deg revenues primarily from increased shipments of signal intelligence applications  which were partially offset by a decrease in ivs revenues of million including an anticipated loss of ct revenues of million 
we expect total revenues to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal across all business groups 
gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to program shifts within our deg revenues 
operating expenses increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily attributable to the increased amortization expense for the year as well as a charge for acquired research and development of million resulting from the advanced radio corporation arc acquisition 
we continue to monitor key operating metrics in order to maintain an appropriate operating expense cost structure relative to our revenue growth expectations 
the overall increase in net income for fiscal as compared to fiscal would have been greater had fiscal not included million in non operating income resulting from the sale of our shared storage business unit ssbu 
in april  we completed a private offering of million of convertible senior notes due the notes  which were sold to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes bear interest at a rate of 
under certain circumstances  the notes will be convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
until the closing price of our common stock is above the contingent conversion price of for at least twenty trading days in a thirty consecutive day period  or upon certain other events  the shares will not be included in calculation of weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating our earnings per share 
we have the right to redeem the notes on or after may  at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the noteholders may require us to repurchase the notes at par plus accrued and unpaid interest on may   and and upon certain other events 
on may   we completed our acquisition of the tgs group tgs 
tgs is a leading supplier of three dimensional d image processing and visualization software to diverse end markets including life sciences medical imaging and biotechnology  geosciences earth sciences including oil and gas exploration  and simulation commercial and defense 
tgs is headquartered in bordeaux  france and has operations in berlin  germany and san diego  california and has sales offices in italy and the united kingdom 
the results of tgs operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since may  the tgs purchase price consisted of cash of million as well as  shares of our common stock  valued at million based the average closing price of our common stock for the five day period including two days before and after april   the date we renegotiated the purchase price with the sellers 
as of june   we had paid million of the cash consideration and had not yet issued the required shares of common stock due to a dispute regarding the determination of the final purchase price 
as of june   we had recorded million as a current liability and million as a long term other liability for the expected remaining purchase price payable to the former tgs shareholders 
the terms of the stock purchase agreement require an adjustment to the purchase price based on a measure of net assets as of the acquisition date  may  based on the provisions of the agreement  we believe that we are entitled to a million reduction in the purchase price  a position that the former shareholders of tgs dispute 
as a result  the final purchase price for tgs has not been determined as of june  as of june   we have recorded a total tgs purchase price of million  reflecting the million expected reduction to the purchase price and including million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
because d imaging is becoming the accepted standard for many medical procedures  following the closing of the acquisition  we combined our capabilities in medical imaging and visualization under a common business group called imaging and visualization solutions  formerly our medical imaging business group 
on june   we completed our acquisition of advanced radio corporation arc 
arc is a developer of rf products that target sigint applications and commercial opportunities such as wireless infrastructure testing 
the acquisition will enable us to develop front end rf products that complement our real time processing strengths in the sigint market 
the total purchase price of million consisted of million in cash plus million of transaction costs directly related to the acquisition 
the results of arc s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since june  going forward  business and market uncertainties may affect future results 
for a discussion of key factors that could impact the future and must be managed by us  please refer to the discussion below 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  litigation  and the valuation of inventory  long lived assets  goodwill  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in our estimates from period to period  such as changes in assumptions underlying our estimates  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
similarly  using the ends of the range of reasonably possible amounts that we determined in formulating our estimate  rather than the reported estimate  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  during the past three fiscal years  such changes in our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable and inventory valuation and to warranty cost accruals  have not had material impact on our overall financial performance or on any individual line item in our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
certain contracts with customers require us to perform tests of our products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with our published product specifications and  on occasion  with additional customer requested specifications 
in these cases  we conduct such tests and  if they are completed successfully  include a written confirmation with each order shipped 
as a result  at the time of each product shipment  we believe that no further customer testing requirements exist and that there is no uncertainty of non acceptance by our customer 
in the rare instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility  we do not recognize any revenue until the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the customer has been received 
we do not provide our customers with rights of product return  other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods 
we accrue for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment 
installation of our products require insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the products and may be performed by our customers or other vendors 
if an order includes installation or training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training obligations until such time as the services have been provided 
we determine these fair values based on the price typically charged to our customers who purchase these services separately 
in limited circumstances  we engage in long term contracts to design  develop  manufacture or modify complex equipment 
for these contracts  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  measuring progress toward completion based on contract cost incurred to date as compared with total estimated contract costs 
the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the contract  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials  and the availability of subcontractor services and materials 
our estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers  program managers and other personnel who review each long term contract monthly to assess the contract s schedule  performance  technical matters and estimated cost at completion 
when adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined  such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which determined 
for transactions involving the licensing of stand alone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product  we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery of the software has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our stand alone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by us or significant modification or customization of the software 
the fair value of maintenance agreements related to stand alone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
at the time of product shipment  we assess collectibility of trade receivables based on a number of factors  including past transaction and collection history with a customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collectibility of a particular sale is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon receipt of payment from the customer 
after the time of sale  we assess our exposure to changes in our customers abilities to pay outstanding receivables and record allowances for such potential bad debts 
inventory inventory  which includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate inventory for net realizable value 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  consisting of on hand and non cancelable on order inventory in excess of estimated usage 
the excess and obsolete inventory evaluation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
if actual demand  product mix or possible alternative uses are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of acquired intangible assets and property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to prior operating results projections  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of acquired intangible assets or property and equipment may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
income tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
except for deferred tax assets acquired in the tgs acquisition  we believe that it is more likely that not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted income  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our expectations of future income 
we have provided a valuation allowance against the net amount of tgs deferred tax assets 
warranty accrual our product sales include a one year hardware warranty 
at time of product shipment  we accrue for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products 
estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar products 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended june  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  revenues by operating segment 
years ended june  defense electronics group imaging and visualization solutions group oem solutions group total revenues fiscal vs 
fiscal total revenues increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal international revenues represented approximately of total revenues during fiscal compared with approximately of total revenues during fiscal defense electronics group revenues increased or million to million during fiscal  compared to during fiscal the increase in deg revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in shipments of sigint applications  partially offset by a million decline in shipments of radar and defense technologies 
the decrease in shipments of radar and defense technologies applications was due to the timing of programs 
radar applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal sigint applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal defense technology applications accounted for of defense electronics revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal we expect defense electronics revenues to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased shipments of sigint applications 
imaging and visualization solutions group revenues decreased or million to million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in imaging and visualization solutions revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from products used in ct imaging systems  a decrease in sales that had been expected by us  partially offset by a million increase in other modalities including digital x ray and mri 
the reduction in revenues derived from ct imaging systems was due to introductions by customers of ct systems that do not contain our products 
the acquisition of tgs contributed million of revenues in fiscal we expect ivs revenues to increase in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the acquisition of tgs and design wins 
oem solutions group revenues increased or million to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased shipments to semiconductor imaging oems for developing and testing of new semiconductor imaging systems as design wins moved to production 
shipments to semiconductors customers represented approximately of osg revenues in fiscal and increased by million to million in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect osg revenues to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of design wins within the semiconductor business 
gross profit gross profit was for fiscal  an increase of basis points from the gross profit achieved during fiscal the increase in gross profit during fiscal as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to program shifts within our deg revenues 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in the expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of arc and tgs  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal and million of increased professional services associated with sarbanes oxley compliance efforts  as well as a charge for acquired research and development of million resulting from the arc acquisition  offset by the absence in fiscal of million expensed in fiscal related to an arbitration award against us in a former employee matter 
research and development research and development expenses increased slightly by  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased compensation and  higher prototype and development costs associated with several development programs  and the inclusion of tgs and arc  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal compared to none in the prior year  all of which were partially offset by the reduced compensation of terminating certain employees in the last quarter of fiscal research and development is essential to our future success  and we expect that research and development expenses will increase in future periods 
interest income  net we earned million in interest income  net  during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense of million associated with the issuance of million of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by increased interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances during fiscal gain on sales of division and joint venture we recorded a gain of million during fiscal year as the result of the sale of the ssbu to ibm 
we received the final payments due from ibm for the sale of the ssbu in march income taxes provision our provision for income taxes was million during fiscal  reflecting a tax rate  as compared to million during fiscal  reflecting a tax rate 
the fiscal and fiscal tax rates are less than the us statutory rate of primarily due to research and development credits  tax exempt interest and the extraterritorial income eti benefit 
the decrease in the tax rate to in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased tax benefits related to the eti benefit and research and development tax credits 
segment operating results income from operations of each reporting segment excludes substantially all research and development expenses and other unallocated operating expenses that cannot be specifically identified with a reporting segment 
income from operations of the deg segment increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in income from operations of the deg segment was primarily due to the increase in sigint applications revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal which carry a higher gross margin 
income from operations of the ivs segment decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease in income from operations of the ivs segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decline in revenues as well as the increased operating expenses associated with the acquisition of tgs during the fourth quarter of fiscal income from operations of the osgs segment increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in income from operations of the osg segment in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in revenues from fiscal see note n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding our operating segments 
fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues total revenues increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal international revenues represented approximately of total revenues during fiscal  compared with approximately of total revenue during fiscal defense electronics group revenues increased  or million  to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in deg revenues occurred across each of the three primary application markets within the segment  including radar  sigint and emerging applications markets as well as revenues attributed to the acquisition of myriad logic in april  which contributed million during the year ended june   compared to million for the same period in order rates for the deg business in fiscal were below the order rates in fiscal  which resulted in a reduction of our backlog at june  compared with june  imaging and visualization solutions group revenues decreased  or million  to million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in ivs revenues was primarily due to a million decrease in revenues from products used in ct imaging systems offset by a million increase in other modalities including digital x ray and mri 
the reduction in revenues derived from ct imaging systems was due to introductions by customers of ct systems that do not contain our products 
revenues from ct systems were approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate shipments of the ct imaging systems in fiscal year will be insignificant 
oem solutions group revenues increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in revenue was due primarily to increased shipments of high throughput baggage scanning applications as well as increased shipments to semiconductor imaging oems for developing and testing of new semiconductor imaging systems 
gross profit gross profit was for fiscal an increase of basis points from the gross profit achieved during fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher revenue volumes in fiscal compared to fiscal  which absorbed certain fixed manufacturing costs  and increased deg sales  which carry a higher gross margin 
this increase was partially offset by million included in cost of sales in fiscal relating to the costs of terminating certain employees in the last quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in the expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of myriad  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal compared to million during the year ended june   an arbitration award against us in a former employee matter of approximately million  million relating to the costs of terminating certain employees in the last quarter of fiscal  and an increased compensation expense as a result of the increased headcount throughout most of fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher prototype and development costs associated with several development programs  the inclusion of myriad  which contributed million of expenses for fiscal compared to million during fiscal  million related to the costs of terminating certain employees in the last quarter of fiscal  and an increased compensation expense as a result of the increased headcount throughout most of fiscal as compared to fiscal interest income  net we earned million in interest income  net  during fiscal compared to million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates experienced during fiscal than in fiscal  despite higher invested cash balances 
gain on sales of division and joint venture we recorded gains of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  as the result of the sale of the ssbu to ibm 
we received the final payments due from ibm for the sale of the ssbu in march in february  we sold our entire interest in the agilevision joint venture to leitch technology corporation 
we received no proceeds and recorded a  gain related to the sale of the joint venture in fiscal and recorded million of losses related to the operations of agilevision during the year ended june  income taxes provision our provision for income taxes was million during fiscal  reflecting a tax rate  as compared to a million tax provision during fiscal  reflecting a tax rate 
the fiscal and fiscal tax rates are less than the us statutory rate of primarily due to research and development credits  tax exempt interest and the eti benefit 
the increase in the tax rate to in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in tax exempt interest and increased non deductible items in fiscal segment operating results income loss from operations of each reporting segment excludes the effects of substantially all research and development expenses and other unallocated operating expenses that cannot be specifically identified with a reporting segment 
as of january  the wireless communications group no longer existed as a standalone business unit  and its resources and personnel were allocated to the defense electronics group and the oem solutions group 
income from operations of the deg segment increased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in income from operations of the deg segment was primarily due to the increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal income from operations of the ivs segment decreased million to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the decrease in income from operations of the ivs segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decline in revenues  slightly offset by decreased costs related to a medical development program which ended in fiscal income from operations of the osg segment increased million to million during fiscal from an operating loss of million during fiscal the increase in income from operations of the osg segment in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in revenues in fiscal see note n to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information regarding our operating segments 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and marketable securities increased by million to million as of june  as compared to million as of june  in fiscal  we generated approximately million in cash from operations compared to million generated in fiscal the million decrease in the amount of cash generated from operations during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
days sales outstanding were days and days at june  and  respectively 
we used approximately million from investing activities during fiscal  a decrease in use of cash of million as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in the use of cash for investing activities was due primarily to a decrease of net purchases of marketable securities of million and was partially offset by an increase in cash used for acquisitions of million and the absence of million in proceeds as recorded in fiscal from the sale of our ssbu 
during fiscal  our investing activities consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million and million for the purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of our ssbu of million 
during fiscal  our financing activities provided cash of million  an increase of million from the same period in fiscal the increase in cash from financing activities primarily consisted of million in net proceeds received from a convertible debt offering as well as the absence of stock repurchases during the year 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering of these notes for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  research and development  and potential acquisitions and strategic investments 
we have broad discretion as to how to allocate these net proceeds  and there can be no assurance that these proceeds can or will yield a significant return 
we used approximately million in cash from financing activities during fiscal during  financing activities consisted of repurchases of treasury stock of million and payments of principal under mortgage notes payable and capital leases of million

we made no stock purchases during fiscal the terms of our mortgage note agreements contain certain covenants  which  among other provisions  require us to maintain a minimum net worth 
the mortgage note agreements also include significant prepayment penalties 
we were in compliance with all covenants of the mortgage note agreements as of june  the terms of our convertible notes contain certain contingent conversion provisions 
under certain circumstances  the notes will be convertible into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the conversion rate is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
until the closing price of our common stock is above the initial threshold price of for at least trading days in a consecutive trading day period ending on the eleventh trading day of any fiscal quarter  or upon certain other events  the shares will not be included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating our earnings per share 
the convertible notes mature on may  and bear interest at per year  payable semiannually in arrears in may and november 
the convertible notes are unsecured  rank equally in right of payment to our existing and future senior debt  and do not subject us to any financial covenants 
the holders may require us to repurchase the notes  in whole or in part  on may   or  upon a change in control  or if our common stock is neither listed nor approved for trading on specified markets 
at our option  we may redeem any of the convertible notes on or after may  at a price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the following is a schedule of our commitments and contractual obligations outstanding at june  in thousands total less than year years years more than years notes payable interest due on notes payable purchase obligations operating leases amounts payable for acquisition other long term liabilities deferred compensation currently  our prime source of liquidity comes from cash  marketable securities and cash generated from operations

we do not currently have any material commitments for capital expenditures or any other material commitments aside from operating leases for our facilities and inventory purchase commitments 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy working capital requirements  we may need to access funds through bank loans  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us  on a timely basis or at all 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  respond to competition or continue to effectively operate our business

in july  the fasb announced that it had reached a tentative consensus with respect to emerging issue task force  the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
the fasb s tentative consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in diluted earnings per share computations if dilutive regardless of whether their market price triggers or other contingent features have been met 
if this proposal becomes effective  it could require us to include an additional million shares  using the if converted method under which net income would also be adjusted to exclude imputed interest expense in our computation of diluted earnings per share for the three month period ending december  and subsequent fiscal periods 
depending upon the text of any final changes in applicable accounting principles and their effect on us  we may be required to restate prior period earnings per share and amounts presented for comparative purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
the principal interest rate exposure is to changes in domestic interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short and long term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed rate convertible debt and mortgages 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
since the convertible debt was out of the money at year end  it was treated as a fixed rate debt security and the analysis assumes that the entire principal amount is repaid in full at maturity and the exercise of the embedded equity option is ignored 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential decrease in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on this basis  the potential loss in fair value from changes in interest rates is million as of june  the potential loss reflects a fair value loss on debt offset by a fair value gain on investments 
we expect to hold our debt to maturity or conversion  whichever is sooner 
therefore  the realization of the potential loss on the debt obligations is unlikely 
foreign currency risk we operate primarily in the united states 
in fiscal  of our revenues was billed in us dollars 
however  a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  italy  germany  japan  the netherlands and france  where business is transacted in non us dollar currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in the exchange rates of these currencies 
local currencies are used as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  france  italy  germany  the netherlands and japan 
consequently  changes in the exchange rates of the currencies may impact the translation of the foreign subsidiaries statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect our consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of the movements in foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial for all periods 
we have not entered into any financial derivatives instruments that expose us to material market risk  including any instruments designed to hedge the impact of foreign currency exposures
