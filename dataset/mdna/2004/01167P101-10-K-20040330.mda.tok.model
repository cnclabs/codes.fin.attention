in december  the company entered into a telecommunications services partnering agreement or tpa with the state of alaska that became effective on april   to provide comprehensive telecommunications services for a period of five years 
this contract obligated the company  among other things  to deploy and manage advanced and innovative technologies through new 
table of contents and previously untested business practices 
the tpa contained a specific completion date of april  for certain implementation aspects  as the well as specific ongoing service level agreements 
both parties to the tpa alleged breaches and failures to perform by the other party  and on september   the company received notification from the state of alaska that the state was terminating the tpa between the two parties and initiating the disentanglement procedures under the contract 
on october   the company announced that it had entered into a voluntary settlement with the state of alaska regarding the tpa 
subsequently  the company and the state negotiated and agreed to a definitive settlement agreement and mutual release  or the settlement agreement  effective october  as of december   the company and the state had completed the majority of the settlement agreement disentanglement obligations 
all services provided by the company under the tpa prior to january  were either transitioned to other service providers at the direction of the state or transitioned to the company s current commercial rates for such services 
the company generates revenue primarily through the provision of local telephone services  including basic local service to retail customers within the company s service areas  wholesale service to clecs  network access services to interexchange carriers for origination and termination of interstate and intrastate long distance phone calls  enhanced services  ancillary services  such as billing and collection  and universal service payments  the provision of wireless services  the provision of internet services  and the provision of interexchange network long distance and data services 
in addition  the company provides video entertainment services through its partnership with the satellite operator  dish network 
local telephone the company is the largest lec in alaska and the th largest in the united states 
basic local service is generally provided at a flat monthly rate and allows the user to place unlimited calls within a defined local calling area 
access revenues are generated in part by billing interexchange carriers for access to the lec s local network and its customers and in part by billing the local customers themselves 
universal service revenues are a subsidy paid to rural lecs to support the high cost of providing service in rural markets 
other service revenue is generated from ancillary services and enhanced services 
changes in revenue are largely attributable to changes in the number of access lines  local service rates and minutes of use 
other factors can also impact revenue  including intrastate and interstate revenue settlement methodologies  authorized rates of return for regulated services  whether an access line is used by a business or consumer subscriber  intrastate and interstate calling patterns  customers selection of various local rate plan options  selection of enhanced calling services  such as voice mail  and other subscriber usage characteristics 
lecs have three basic tiers of customers consumer and business customers located in their local service areas that pay for local phone service and a portion of network access  interexchange carriers that pay for access to long distance calling customers located within its local service areas and 
table of contents clecs that pay for wholesale access to the company s network in order to provide competitive local service on either a wholesale or une basis as prescribed under the act 
lecs provide access service to numerous interexchange carriers and may also bill and collect long distance charges from interexchange carrier customers on behalf of the interexchange carriers 
the amount of access charge revenue associated with a particular interexchange carrier varies depending upon long distance calling patterns and the relative market share of each long distance carrier 
the company s local service rates for end users are authorized by the rca 
authorized rates are set by the fcc and the rca for interstate and intrastate access charges  respectively  and may change from time to time 
wireless the company is one of the largest statewide providers of wireless services in alaska  currently serving approximately  subscribers 
its wireless network covers over  residents  including all major population centers and highway corridors 
the company operates a tdma digital network in substantially all of its service areas  and plans to upgrade this network to a new generation of digital network known as cdma xrtt over the course of internet the company is the second largest provider of internet access services in alaska with approximately  customers 
the company offers dial up and dedicated dsl internet access to its customers

interexchange the company provides switched and dedicated long distance services to approximately  customers in alaska 
the traffic from these customers is carried over the company s owned or leased facilities 
satellite television the company provides video entertainment services on a resale basis through the company s partnership with the satellite provider  dish network 
the company entered into this agreement in august critical accounting policies and accounting estimates management is responsible for the financial statements presented elsewhere in this k and has evaluated the accounting policies used in their preparation 
management believes these policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this k 
the following discussion identifies those accounting policies that management believes are critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements  the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the possibility that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting the financial statements are those related to the realizable value of accounts receivable  long lived assets  income taxes  network access revenue reserves and litigation reserves 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
access revenue is recognized when earned 
the company participates in toll revenue pools with other telephone companies 
such pools are funded by toll revenue and or access charges regulated by the rca within the intrastate jurisdiction and the fcc within the interstate jurisdiction 
much of the interstate access revenue is initially recorded based on estimates 
these estimates are derived from interim financial statements  available separations studies and the most recent information available about achieved rates of return 
these estimates are subject to adjustment in future accounting periods as additional operational 
table of contents information becomes available 
to the extent that disputes arise over revenue settlements  the company s policy is to defer revenue collected until settlement methodologies are resolved and finalized 
at december   the company had recorded liabilities of million related to its estimate of refundable access revenue 
actual results could vary from this estimate 
the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes reflect the temporary differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if the company thought it was more likely than not that all of its deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods  the company s previously reported net losses for the three years ended december  would decrease by up to million and its accumulated deficit would decrease from million to as much as million 
the local telephone exchange operations of the company account for costs in accordance with the accounting principles for regulated enterprises prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this accounting recognizes the economic effects of rate regulation by recording cost and a return on investment as such amounts are recovered through rates authorized by regulatory authorities 
accordingly  under sfas no 
 plant and equipment is depreciated over lives approved by regulators and certain costs and obligations are deferred based upon approvals received from regulators to permit recovery of such amounts in future years 
the company implemented  effective january   higher depreciation rates for its regulated telephone plant for the interstate jurisdiction which management believes approximate the economically useful lives of the underlying plant 
as a result  the company has recorded a regulatory asset under sfas no 
of million as of december  related to depreciation of the regulated telephone plant allocable to its intrastate and local jurisdictions 
the company has also deferred as a regulatory asset million of costs incurred in connection with regulatory rate making proceedings  which is being amortized over three years starting in the balance of this regulatory asset was million at december  if the company were not following sfas no 
 it would have recorded additional depreciation expense of million for the intrastate and local jurisdictions and the deferred costs incurred in connection with regulatory rate making proceedings would have been charged to expense as incurred 
the company also has a regulatory liability of million at december  related to accumulated removal costs 
if the company were not following sfas no 
 it would have followed sfas no 
for asset retirement obligations 
non regulated revenues and costs incurred by the local telephone exchange operations and non regulated operations of the company are not accounted for under sfas no 
principles 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with the guidelines of this accounting principle  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but will be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level upon adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step requires the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss would be recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of the unit may be impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment is then measured in the second step 
the company determined the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of this test primarily by using a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
significant estimates used in the valuation include estimates of future cash flows  both future short term and long term growth rates  and estimated cost of capital for purposes of arriving at a discount factor 
at december   the company had recorded goodwill of million applicable to its local telephone and wireless segments 
the company is involved in various claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  and has recorded litigation reserves of million as of december  against certain claims and legal actions 
the company believes that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
estimates involved in developing these litigation reserves could change as these claims  legal actions and regulatory proceedings are resolved

local telephone local telephone revenues  which consist of local network service  network access revenue  and deregulated revenues and other  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the local network service component of local telephone revenues was million during compared with million during local network service revenue decreased million or from the prior year  while average access lines in service decreased to  substantially all of the decrease reflects the net effect of retail market share losses offset by increases in unbundled network element revenue 
retail access lines decreased  or to  at december  the company experienced a loss of direct retail customers during the year as customers cancelled second lines they were not using or switched to competing service providers 
this reduction in direct retail customers was partially offset by an increase in wholesale lines 
generally  if a retail local network service customer of the company switches to a competitor  the company continues to provide the line to the competitor on a wholesale basis at reduced revenue per line 
management believes that the continuing loss of market share it has experienced in certain of its markets is partially attributable to below cost interconnection rates mandated by the rca for unes 
during the first quarter of  the company reopened interconnection proceedings for its anchorage market and during the second quarter of filed for an interim and refundable une rate increase of approximately per month per loop 
on october   the rca granted acsa an interim une rate increase of  bringing the une rate up from to 
the interim and refundable rate increase was implemented in november and generated approximately million in additional revenue during the rca held a formal hearing on final anchorage une rates during november the company cannot predict when the rca will issue a final order in this matter or what the outcome will be 
see business regulation under item of part i of this report for further discussion 
the company believes it is earning less than its authorized rate of return for local network service in several of its markets and in compliance with apuc orders related to the approval of the acquisition of the four lecs in  filed local service rate cases for all of its lec businesses with the rca on july  aimed at making up this deficiency 
the rca s decisions on revenue requirements will have a direct impact on the retail rates and intrastate access rates that the company is allowed to charge 
a rca finding of over earnings generally leads to rate reductions while a rca finding of under earnings generally results in rate increases 
in october  the company filed for increased interim and refundable local service rates in its anchorage market in order to expedite a partial recovery of the total revenue deficiency 
on november   the rca approved an interim and refundable rate increase for acsa of for certain services 
this interim and refundable rate increase was implemented in november and generated approximately million in revenue for the year the rca concluded the revenue requirement phase of the hearing for acsa by finding acsa to be under earning 
by increasing the amount the company is considered to under earn  the rca set the groundwork for increasing the rates the company charges so that the company earns enough to cover investment requirements to replace old assets 
the company expects the rca to continue to hold rate hearings during december 
table of contents on march   the rca issued an order approving new revenue requirements for acsf  acsak  and acsn 
the rca found over earnings by acsf and acsn and under earnings by acsak 
in compliance with rca orders  acsf  acsak  acsn have filed cost of service and rate design studies  and supporting testimony  consistent with the rca revenue requirements orders 
on february   the rca held a hearing to review a stipulated rate settlement 
final rates are expected to be approved during the first half of network access revenues decreased by million  or  from million in to million in during the second quarter of  the company recognized as revenue million of previously deferred interstate access revenue related to a dispute on interstate access rates for the anchorage market based on a favorable ruling by the district of columbia court of appeals 
network access revenue is based on a regulated return on rate base and recovery of allowable expense associated with the origination and termination of toll calls for the company s retail and resale customers 
excluding the impact of the revenue recognized as a result of the favorable ruling by the court  the increase in network access revenues of million compared to the corresponding period in is due primarily to updated access studies 
management expects that network access revenues will generally be on a declining trend for the foreseeable future 
deregulated and other revenues  which increased million  or from  consists principally of b c services  space and power rents  deregulated equipment sales  paystation revenues  regulated directory listing revenue  and other miscellaneous telephone revenues the increase in deregulated and other revenue was due primarily to an increase in rents and b c revenue

the increase in interexchange revenue is due to an increase in intrastate revenue offset by a decrease in interstate revenue

under the new accounting method  asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
when the liability is initially recorded  the cost is capitalized and increases the carrying value of the related long lived asset 
the liability is then accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
at the settlement date  the obligation is settled for its recorded amount or a gain or loss is recognized upon settlement

unless specifically required by the fcc in the future

table of contents outlook the company expects that  overall  the demand for telecommunications services in alaska will grow  particularly as a result of increasing demand for private network services by government and business on a statewide basis on either a circuit switched or ip basis  increasing demand for wireless voice and data services  and growth in demand for dsl and internet access services due to higher business and consumer bandwidth needs 
the company believes that it will be able to capitalize on this demand through its diverse service offerings on its owned circuit switched and ip facilities and new sales and marketing initiatives directed toward basic voice  enhanced and data services 
there are currently a number of regulatory proceedings underway at the state and federal levels that could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company cannot predict with certainty the impact of current or future regulatory developments on any of its businesses 
the telecommunications industry is extremely competitive  and the company expects competition to intensify in the future 
as an ilec  the company faces competition mainly from resellers  local providers who lease its unes and  to a lesser degree  from facilities based providers of local telephone services 
moreover  while wireless telephone services have historically complemented traditional lec services  the company anticipates that existing and emerging wireless technologies may increasingly compete with lec services 
similarly  local and interexchange service competition may come from cable television providers and voice over ip providers 
in wireless services  the company currently competes with at least one other wireless provider in each of its wireless service areas 
in the highly competitive business for internet access services  the company currently competes with a number of established online service companies  interexchange carriers and cable companies 
in the interexchange market  the company believes it currently has less than of total revenue in alaska and faces competition from the two major interexchange providers 
the telecommunications industry is subject to continuous technological change 
the company expects that new technological developments in the future will generally serve to enhance its ability to provide service to its customers 
however  these developments may also increase competition or require the company to make significant capital investments to maintain its leadership position in alaska 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation on the company s financial results has not been significant in the periods presented
