overview durect corporation is pioneering the treatment of chronic diseases and conditions by developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems to deliver the right drug to the right site in the right amount at the right time 
these capabilities can enable new drug therapies or optimize existing ones based on a broad range of compounds  including small molecule pharmaceuticals as well as biotechnology molecules such as proteins  peptides and genes 
we focus on the treatment of chronic diseases including pain  cardiovascular diseases and central nervous system disorders and the development of pharmaceutical products incorporating biotechnology agents 
we are developing these pharmaceutical system products based on our solid foundation of four proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
these platforms are duros  saber  microdur and durin technology platforms 
chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system our lead product in development is the chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system  an osmotic implant that continuously delivers sufentanil  an opioid medication  for three months 
this product is designed to treat chronic pain  and is based on the duros implant technology for which we hold an exclusive license from alza corporation  a johnson johnson company  to develop and commercialize products in selected fields 
in  we successfully completed a phase ii clinical trial  a pharmacokinetic trial and a pilot phase iii clinical trial for the chronogesic product 
we also completed construction of a pilot aseptic manufacturing facility designed to manufacture the chronogesic product for our phase iii clinical trials and to meet initial demand for our product if approved by the fda 
in  we announced positive results of our pilot phase iii clinical trial  validated our aseptic manufacturing facility and used the facility to manufacture clinical supplies for our initial pivotal phase iii clinical trial 
we also conducted ongoing animal toxicological studies and other development activities that are necessary to support regulatory approval of the product in the us and abroad 
we initiated our first pivotal phase iii clinical trial for the chronogesic product in june in august  the fda requested that we delay enrolling new patients in our phase iii clinical trial initiated in june until the clinical trial protocol is revised and approved by the fda to provide for additional patient monitoring and data collection 
these requested protocol changes were not in response to any observed patient safety or adverse event 
we subsequently discontinued all patients from the clinical trial at our discretion in september independently from the fda s request for protocol changes  in october  we started to implement manufacturing process 
table of contents changes to the chronogesic product to permit terminal sterilization of the product and system design enhancements to prevent a premature shutdown in the delivery of drug prior to the end of the intended month delivery period which was observed in a number of units utilizing the previous system design 
we have stopped all clinical trials for the chronogesic product until the system design is completed 
in november  we entered into a development  commercialization and supply license agreement with endo under which the companies will collaborate on the development and commercialization of our chronogesic product for the us and canada 
in january  we amended the agreement to take into account the delay in the chronogesic development program due to durect s implementation of necessary design and manufacturing enhancements to the product 
for the period commencing january  until the earlier of january  or the commencement of a specified clinical trial  endo will fund of the ongoing development costs for the chronogesic product in the us and canada exclusive of system redesign costs and pharmacokinetic trials necessitated by any system redesign up to an aggregate amount of  for the period 
commencing on january  or  if earlier  the commencement of a specified clinical trial for the chronogesic product  endo will fund of the ongoing development costs and will reimburse us for a portion of our prior development costs for the product upon the achievement of certain milestones 
development based milestone payments made by endo under this agreement could total up to million 
in addition  under the agreement  endo has licensed exclusive promotional rights to the chronogesic product in the us and canada 
endo will be responsible for marketing  sales and distribution  including providing specialty sales representatives dedicated to supplying technical and training support for chronogesic therapy and will pay for all product launch costs 
we will be responsible for the manufacture of the chronogesic product 
we will share profits from the commercialization of the product in the us and canada with endo based on the financial performance of the chronogesic product 
based on our projected financial performance of the product in the us and canada  we anticipate that our share of such profits from commercialization of the product will be approximately 
in  we continued to conduct in vitro and animal studies  implement and evaluate system design and manufacturing process changes and revise clinical trial protocols for the chronogesic product 
in october  we announced that we had received data from a preclinical animal test with our chronogesic product utilizing a revised system design which indicate that a small number of units continue to experience a premature shutdown of drug delivery prior to the end of the intended month delivery period 
in parallel track with the chronogesic development program using the revised system design  we have been exploring additional enhancements to prevent any premature shutdown  and have already generated feasibility data relating to these enhancements 
we are evaluating incorporating these mechanisms into our system design and other system design changes to prevent any premature shutdown of the system 
we expect that we will restart the product s phase iii clinical program during the second half of saber post operative pain depot product we continue to research and develop other products for the treatment of chronic diseases using the duros system  as well as saber  durin and microdur technologies we acquired through the acquisition of southern biosystems  inc sbs in april during  we also continued to research and develop a number of other pharmaceutical products including our post operative pain depot product  a sustained release injectible using the saber delivery system and a local anesthetic 
this product is designed to be administered around a surgical site after surgery for post operative pain relief and is intended to provide local analgesia for up to three days  which we believe coincides with the time period of the greatest need for post surgical pain control in most patients 
bupivacaine  the active agent for the product  is currently fda approved for use in hospitals as a local anesthetic 
in june  we commenced the first clinical trial for our post operative pain product 
the clinical trial was conducted in europe and enrolled normal  healthy subjects 
the objectives of the clinical study were to determine the safety and tolerability of the saber delivery system and the saber bupivacaine combination and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of our saber product versus current treatment methods  which include bupivacaine and ropivacaine 
we completed this clinical trial in the third quarter of in europe 

table of contents collaborative agreements in order to rapidly identify and fund additional product opportunities  we may partner with various companies who wish to explore the feasibility of combining their drug formulations with our drug delivery technologies to commercialize products 
in addition  we may partner with companies who wish to collaborate on the development and commercialization of our existing products in development 
under these collaborative arrangements  we may agree to perform research and development activities to develop these products 
we may also agree on royalty  distribution  or other rights once potential products are eventually commercialized 
in  we entered into the several partnering arrangements see durect strategy enable product development through strategic partnerships in item business 
we intend to enter into additional collaborative partnering arrangements in the future 
during  we also continued to make technical progress on our collaborative research and development projects with our strategic partners  such as pain therapeutics  inc  biopartners  gmbh  voyager pharmaceutical corporation and others 
in particular  our strategic partner  pain therapeutics  inc  recently announced the commencement of a phase i clinical trial for a novel long acting formulation of oxycodone that utilizes our saber delivery system  targeted to decrease the potential for oxycodone abuse 
under these collaborative agreements with the strategic partners  we perform research and development activities to develop products utilizing our drug delivery technologies and recognize collaborative research and development revenue on reimbursement payments of expenses and milestone payments from our partners 
depending on the agreement  we may also have royalty  distribution  or other rights once products are commercialized under the agreement 
we intend to enter into additional collaborative partnering arrangements in the future 
our collaborative agreement with biopartners  gmbh was terminated in december other business activities in june and july  we completed a private placement of an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are due on june  the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears in june and december 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting fees of million and related expenses of  the convertible subordinated notes are unsecured obligation of ours and are subordinate to any secured debt we currently have or any future senior indebtness we may have 
on august   we completed an acquisition of apt  a private alabama corporation engaged in the business of selling biodegradable polymers  pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger by and among us  absorbable polymer technologies  inc and birmingham polymers  inc 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and agreed to issue additional shares of our common stock or cash in connection with the first  second and third anniversaries of the closing of the merger 
the total purchase price was million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization 
direct transaction costs related to the acquisition were approximately  apt was merged into birmingham polymers  inc bpi  our wholly owned subsidiary upon closing of the merger 
bpi changed its name to absorbable polymers international corporation api in november our financial statements for the year ended december  include the results of operations of apt subsequent to the acquisition date 
in the fourth quarter of  we consolidated most of our operations located in birmingham  alabama to our headquarter in cupertino  california to preserve capital and further focus on bringing our products to commercialization 
as a result of the consolidation  approximately positions were eliminated 
total severance benefits paid in were approximately  we did not have any write down of tangible or intangible assets associated with the reduction in force in we expect to have lower employee expenses from our birmingham division in the near future 

table of contents we currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  and lactel biodegradable polymers through our wholly owned subsidiary  api  which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products 
because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party partners to develop products based on our drug delivery technologies 
since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our products and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
our net losses in also included the write off of million of in process research and development acquired in our april acquisition of sbs 
we expect our research and development expenses to modestly increase in the future as we continue to expand our clinical trials and research and development activities 
we anticipate that we will support our research and development activities within existing corporate infrastructure  so we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in light of the additional cost of corporate governance requirements in the near future 
we also expect to incur additional non cash expenses relating to amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we do not anticipate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least several years 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized at the time the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
incorrect assumptions at the time of sale about our customers ability to pay could result in an overstatement of revenue 
revenue related to collaborative research and development with our corporate partners is recognized as the related research and development services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
the payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative and development research agreements approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not 
table of contents expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
milestone and royalties payments  if any  will be recognized as earned 
incorrect determination of qualified expenses could result in greater or lesser revenue being recorded 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts  such as other contract research and development revenue  is recognized only to the extent of reimbursable costs incurred plus estimated fees thereon 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion method based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated cost 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only after a signed agreement is in place 
for contracts that have a ceiling price or contract value  losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the losses become known and estimable 
incorrect estimates as to percentage of completion or losses expected to be incurred could result in greater or lesser revenues or losses being recorded 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technology are amortized over time  while acquired in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
we recorded a charge for acquired in process research and development of million during the year ended december   resulting from the acquisition of sbs in april this amount represented the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which had not yet reached technological feasibility  and which had no alternative future use 
the determination of the amount of acquired in process research and development involves several estimates and judgments  including the percentage of completion of the in process technology and assumptions about future cash flows to be derived from the technology and discount rates 
different assumptions employed in determining the value of in process research and development could have resulted in a greater or lesser amount being recorded 
as of january   goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our 
table of contents management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
management believes that the discount rate used in this analysis is reasonable in light of currently available information 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective 
as a result  we ceased amortizing approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce 
in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and will perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
we completed our initial review during the second quarter of we concluded that our goodwill was fairly stated as of january  and no accounting change adjustment was necessary 
we also conducted an impairment review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of and and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  and however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for clinical trials  engineering  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on managements estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item of our form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
total revenues were million in compared to million in a significant portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  and to a lesser extent our polymer and ear catheter products 
the increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to higher collaborative research and development revenue recognized from our collaborative agreements with various strategic partners 
net product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a modest increase in revenue from our alzet mini pump product line and api biodegradable polymer product line 
we ceased selling intraear catheter products in september due to a change in business strategic focus 
intraear products comprised  and  of revenue in and  respectively 
we also recognize a portion of our revenue from collaborative research and development activities and service contract revenue 
we recorded million of collaborative research and development revenue in compared to  in collaborative research and development revenue represent reimbursement of qualified expenses related to the collaborative agreements we signed in with various corporate partners to research  develop and commercialize potential products using our drug delivery technologies 
total other revenue from service contracts was  in compared to  in the other revenues in were related to polymer service contracts provided by api  whereas the service contract revenues in were related to certain feasibility evaluation agreements 

table of contents in the future  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
in addition  we do not expect to generate any service contract revenues in the future 
however  we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party partners to develop products based on our drug delivery technologies 
in the fiscal years and  one customer accounted for and of our total revenues respectively 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in cost of revenue includes cost of product revenue and to a lesser extent  cost of contract services provided by us 
the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies achieved in our alzet product line 
cost of revenue associated with the product revenue decreased to million in from million in cost of other revenue from service contracts decreased to  in from  in as we incurred final costs related to service contracts activities in as of december   we had manufacturing employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect cost of revenue to remain comparable in the future  as we do not expect product revenues to increase significantly in the future 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower development costs related to our lead product chronogesic  offset by a slight increase in research and development expenses for our post operative pain product and other direct expenses incurred under our collaborative agreements 
the decrease in the research and development expenses also resulted from lower personnel expenses in compared with the same period of in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our research and development workforce in order to conserve capital following the discontinuation of our pivotal phase iii clinical trial for chronogesic 
as of december   we had research and development employees compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect research and development expenses to slightly decrease in the near term until the restart of clinical trials for chronogesic 
however  we will continue to research and develop other products using our proprietary drug delivery platform technologies  and we expect research and development expenses to increase once we restart clinical trials for chronogesic 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to effective cost controls in the existing corporate infrastructure in and a one time expense of million for strategic partner advisory services in connection with the endo agreement  which was executed in the fourth quarter of as of december   we had selling  general and administrative personnel compared with as of the corresponding date in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in light of the additional cost of corporate governance requirements in the near future even through we strive to conserve cash and leverage our existing infrastructure to support our current business activities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in each of and in and  goodwill was evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas based on our evaluation  no indicators of impairment were noted 
should goodwill become impaired in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value 
the net amount of intangible assets at december  was million  which will be amortized as follows million in each of the years and   in the year   in each of the years  and  and  in the year should other intangible assets become impaired  the company will write them down to their estimated fair value 
stock based compensation 
since inception  we have recorded aggregate deferred compensation charges of million in connection with stock options granted to employees and directors  including  that we 
table of contents recorded at the time of our acquisition of sbs in april for the assumption of outstanding unvested stock options granted to employees and directors of that company 
of the total amount  we have amortized or reversed due to employee terminations million through december  we reversed  of employee stock based compensation in we recorded million of employee stock based compensation in of these amounts  employee stock compensation related to the following cost of revenue of  in and  for  research and development expenses of  in and  in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  in and  for non employee stock compensation related to research and development expenses was  in and  in non employee stock compensation related to selling  general and administrative expenses was none in and  in expenses for non employee stock options are recorded over the vesting period of the options  with the amount determined by the black scholes option valuation method and remeasured over the vesting term 
the remaining deferred employee stock compensation at december  was  which will be amortized as follows  in   in  and  in termination of employment of option holders could cause stock based compensation in future years to be less than indicated 
other income expense 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower yields on debt security investments  partially offset by higher outstanding investment balances from the net issuance of our convertible subordinated notes 
we expect interest income to decline as our average outstanding investment balances decline 
the increase in interest expense of million for from  for was primarily due to interest expense incurred on the million of convertible subordinated notes issued in june and july we expect interest expense to increase as we continue to make interest payments on our convertible notes and to amortize the issuance costs to interest expenses 
income taxes 
we have no provision for income taxes  as we have incurred losses for all periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purpose of approximately million  which expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance

acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development was none for and million for this charge resulted from the acquisition of sbs in april and represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which had not yet reached technological feasibility  and which had no alternative future use 
other income expense 
interest income decreased to million from million in the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding balances of cash and investments that resulted from cash consumed by operations

the proceeds from the convertible notes will be used to fund the research  development  manufacture and commercialization of existing and future products and for general corporate purpose  including working capital and capital expenditures 
on august   we completed an acquisition of apt pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger by and among us  absorbable polymer technologies  inc and birmingham polymers  inc 
in connection with the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  valued at million and agreed to pay the remaining purchase consideration of million through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or cash in connection with the first  second and third anniversaries of the closing of the merger 

table of contents we anticipate that cash used in operating and investing activities will stay at current level or slightly decrease in the near future as we continue to research  develop  and manufacture our products through internal efforts and partnering activities  and service our debt obligations 
in aggregate  we are required to make future payments pursuant to our existing contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations thereafter total convertible subordinated notes long term debt term loan apt acquisition consideration payable operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations note includes principal and interest payments note to be paid by our common stock or cash we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of at least million over the next months to purchase research and development and manufacturing equipment 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our products and our collaborative research and development activities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments  and planned capital expenditures through at least months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems currently under development for at least the next several years  if at all 
accordingly  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  and public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
we have not utilized and do not intend to utilize off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  hedging and derivative strategies  or other complex financial techniques to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus addresses not only when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  but also how the arrangement s consideration should be allocated among separate units 
the pronouncement is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf issue did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under that interpretation  certain entities known as variable interest entities vies must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is generally defined as having the majority of the risks and rewards arising from the vie 
for vies in which a significant but not majority variable interest is held  certain disclosures are required 
it applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and applies in the first year or interim period ending after december  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
the statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after may   and to other instruments for periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
recently passed legislation on july   president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the act  which impact securities and exchange commission registrants  public accounting firms  lawyers and securities analysts 
this legislation is expected to have far reaching effects on the standards of integrity for corporate management  board of directors  and executive management 
additional disclosures  certifications and possibly procedures will be required of the company 
the company does not expect any material change in its practices as a result of the passage of this legislation  however  the full scope of the act has not yet been determined 
the act calls for additional regulations and requirements of publicly traded companies  many of which have yet to be issued 
factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and prospects we have not completed development of any of our pharmaceutical systems  and we cannot be certain that our pharmaceutical systems will be able to be commercialized to be profitable  we must successfully research  develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and distribute our pharmaceutical systems under development 
for each pharmaceutical system that we intend to commercialize  we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones for each disease or medical condition that we target  including selecting and developing drug delivery platform technology to deliver the proper dose of drug over the desired period of time  selecting and developing catheter technology  if appropriate  to deliver the drug to a specific location within the body  
table of contents determining the appropriate drug dosage for use in the pharmaceutical system  developing drug compound formulations that will be tolerated  safe and effective and that will be compatible with the system  and demonstrating the drug formulation will be stable for commercially reasonable time periods 
the time frame necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product is long and uncertain  and we may not successfully complete these milestones for any of our products in development 
we have not yet completed development of any pharmaceutical systems  and durect has limited experience in developing such products 
we have not completed the system design of our lead product  chronogesic  and must still complete necessary design changes and enhancements to the product to prevent the occurrence of any premature shutdown of the system prior to the end of the intended month delivery period prior to continuing clinical trials for the product 
although we have been exploring additional system enhancements to prevent this identified issue and have already generated feasibility data relating to these enhancements  we may not be able to implement these enhancements or these enhancements may not ultimately prevent the occurrence of premature shutdown 
if we fail to timely finalize the design of the chronogesic product  this will harm the long term viability of the product 
in addition  even after we complete the final design of the product  the product must still complete required clinical trials and additional safety testing in animals before approval for commercialization 
see we must conduct and satisfactorily complete required laboratory performance and safety testing  animal studies and clinical trials for our pharmaceutical systems before we can sell them 
we have not selected the drug dosages nor finalized the formulation or the system design of any other pharmaceutical system including those based on our saber  durin and microdur delivery platforms  and we may not be able to finalize the design or formulation of any additional products 
we are continuing testing and development of our products and may explore possible design or formulation changes to address issues of safety  manufacturing efficiency and performance 
we may not be able to complete development of any products that will be safe and effective and that will have a commercially reasonable treatment and storage period 
if we are unable to complete development of our chronogesic product or other products  we will not be able to earn revenue from them  which would materially harm our business 
we must conduct and satisfactorily complete required laboratory performance and safety testing  animal studies and clinical trials for our pharmaceutical systems before we can sell them before we can obtain government approval to sell any of our pharmaceutical systems  we must demonstrate through laboratory performance studies and safety testing  preclinical animal studies and clinical human trials that each system is safe and effective for human use for each targeted disease 
as of september   for our lead product  chronogesic  we have completed an initial phase i clinical trial using an external pump to test the safety of continuous chronic infusion of sufentanil  a phase ii clinical trial  a pilot phase iii clinical trial and a pharmacokinetic trial 
we are currently in the preclinical or research stages with respect to all our other products under development 
we plan to continue extensive and costly tests  clinical trials and safety studies in animals to assess the safety and effectiveness of our chronogesic product 
these studies include laboratory performance studies and safety testing  pivotal phase iii and other clinical trials and animal toxicological studies necessary to support regulatory approval of the product in the united states and other countries of the world 
these studies are costly  complex and last for long durations  and may not yield the data required for regulatory approval of our product 
in addition  we plan to conduct extensive and costly clinical trials and animal studies for our other potential products 
we may not be permitted to begin or continue our planned clinical trials for our potential products or  if our trials are permitted  our potential products may not prove to be safe or produce their intended effects 
in addition  we may be required by regulatory agencies to conduct additional animal or human studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our products  including chronogesic  which we have not planned or anticipated that could delay commercialization of such products and harm our business and financial conditions 
we initiated our first pivotal phase iii clinical trial for the chronogesic product in june in august  the fda requested that we delay enrolling new patients in our phase iii clinical study initiated in 
table of contents june until the clinical trial protocol is revised by us and approved by the fda to provide for additional patient monitoring and data collection 
these requested protocol changes were not in response to any observed patient safety or adverse event 
we subsequently discontinued all patients from the clinical trial at our discretion in september independently from the fda s request for protocol changes  in october  we started to implement manufacturing process changes to the chronogesic product to permit terminal sterilization of the product and system design enhancements to prevent a premature shutdown in the delivery of drug prior to the end of the intended month delivery period which was observed in a number of units utilizing the previous system design 
we have stopped all clinical trials for the chronogesic product until the system design is finalized 
in october  we announced that we received data from a preclinical animal test with our chronogesic product utilizing a revised system design which indicate that a small number of units continue to experience a premature shutdown of drug delivery prior to the end of the intended month delivery period 
we expect that we will restart the product s phase iii clinical program during the second half of we expect our pivotal phase iii trials for chronogesic collectively to include over patients 
the length of our clinical trials will depend upon  among other factors  the rate of trial site and patient enrollment and the number of patients required to be enrolled in such studies 
we may fail to obtain adequate levels of patient enrollment in our clinical trials 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs  delays or termination of clinical trials  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  even if we enroll the number of patients we expect in the time frame we expect  our clinical trials may not provide the data necessary to support regulatory approval for the products for which they were conducted 
additionally  we may fail to effectively oversee and monitor these clinical trials  which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials 
even if these clinical trials are completed  we may fail to complete and submit a new drug application as scheduled 
even if we are able to submit a new drug application as scheduled  the food and drug administration may not clear our application in a timely manner or may deny the application entirely 
data already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our pharmaceutical systems do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later preclinical studies and clinical trials 
moreover  preclinical and clinical data such as ours is susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
the failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the potential product  resulting in delays to the commercialization of our products  and could materially harm our business 
our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for our products  and thus our products may not be approved for marketing 
failure to obtain product approvals or comply with ongoing governmental regulations could delay or limit introduction of our new products and result in failure to achieve anticipated revenues the manufacture and marketing of our products and our research and development activities are subject to extensive regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous government authorities in the united states and abroad 
we must obtain clearance or approval from applicable regulatory authorities before we can market or sell our products in the us or abroad 
before receiving approval or clearance to market a product in the us or in any other country  we will have to demonstrate to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory agencies that the product is safe and effective on the patient population and for the diseases that will be treated 
clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of products are subject to the rigorous testing and approval process of the fda and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and other federal  state and foreign statutes and regulations govern and influence the testing  manufacture  labeling  advertising  distribution and promotion of drugs and medical devices 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
furthermore  these laws and regulations may be subject to varying interpretations  and we may not be able to predict how an applicable 
table of contents regulatory body or agency may choose to interpret or apply any law or regulation 
as a result  clinical trials and regulatory approval can take a number of years to accomplish and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we may encounter delays or rejections based upon administrative action or interpretations of current rules and regulations 
for example  in august  the fda requested that we delay enrolling new patients in our phase iii clinical study for the chronogesic product initiated in june until the clinical trial protocol is amended and approved by the fda to provide for additional patient monitoring and data collection 
we may not be able to timely reach agreement with the fda on our clinical trial protocols or on the required data we must collect to continue with our clinical trials or eventually commercialize our product 
we may also encounter delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation  administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development  clinical trials and fda regulatory review 
we may encounter similar delays in foreign countries 
sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory standards that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be shorter or longer than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain requisite approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities  and even if obtained  such approvals may not be on a timely basis  or they may not cover the clinical uses that we specify 
if we fail to obtain timely clearance or approval for our products  we will not be able to market and sell our products  which will limit our ability to generate revenue 
marketing or promoting a drug is subject to very strict controls 
furthermore  clearance or approval may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the manufacture and marketing of drugs are subject to continuing fda and foreign regulatory review and requirements that we update our regulatory filings 
later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product  manufacturer or facility  or our failure to update regulatory files  may result in restrictions  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
any of the following events  if they were to occur  could delay or preclude us from further developing  marketing or realizing full commercial use of our products  which in turn would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations failure to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals  failure to obtain approvals for clinically intended uses of our products under development  or identification of serious and unanticipated adverse side effects in our products under development 
manufacturers of drugs also must comply with the applicable fda good manufacturing practice regulations  which include production design controls  testing  quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
compliance with current good manufacturing practices regulations is difficult and costly 
manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed before they can be used for the commercial manufacture of our products 
we and or our present or future suppliers and distributors may be unable to comply with the applicable good manufacturing practice regulations and other fda regulatory requirements 
we have not been subject to a good manufacturing regulation inspection by the fda relating to our pharmaceutical systems 
if we do not achieve compliance for the products we manufacture  the fda may refuse or withdraw marketing clearance or require product recall  which may cause interruptions or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
our near term revenues depend on collaborations with other companies 
if we are unable to meet milestones under these agreements or enter into additional collaboration agreements or if our existing collaborations are terminated  our revenues may decrease 
our near term revenues are based to a significant extent on collaborative arrangements with third parties  pursuant to which we receive payments based on our performance of research and development activities and the 
table of contents attainment of milestones set forth in the agreements 
we may not be able to attain milestones set forth in any specific agreement  which could cause our revenues to fluctuate or be less than anticipated 
in general  our collaboration agreements  including our agreements with endo pharmaceuticals  inc  pain therapeutics  inc  and voyager pharmaceutical corporation  may be terminated by the other party at will or upon specified conditions including  for example  if we fail to satisfy specified performance milestones or if we breach the terms of the agreement 
our agreement with endo for the development and commercialization of our chronogesic product in the us and canada can be terminated by endo in january in the event we have not commenced a specified clinical trial for the chronogesic product by january  if the agreements are terminated  our revenues will be reduced and our products related to those agreements may not be commercialized 
we have limited or no control over the resources that any collaborator may devote to our products 
any of our present or future collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected 
these collaborators may breach or terminate their agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  our collaborators may elect not to develop or commercialize products arising out of our collaborative arrangements or not devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or sale of these products 
if any of these events occur  we may not be able to develop our technologies or commercialize our products based on such collaborations 
we have a history of operating losses  expect to continue to have losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses over the next several years as we continue to incur costs for research and development  clinical trials and manufacturing 
our ability to achieve profitability depends upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully complete the development of our proposed products  obtain the required regulatory clearances and manufacture and market our proposed products 
development of pharmaceutical systems is costly and requires significant investment 
in addition  we may choose to license either additional drug delivery platform technology or rights to particular drugs or other appropriate technology for use in our pharmaceutical systems 
the license fees for these technologies or rights would increase the costs of our pharmaceutical systems 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue from the commercial sale of our products and do not expect to receive significant revenue in the near future 
all revenues to date are from the sale of products we acquired in october in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of intraear  inc  the alzet product we acquired in april from alza and the sale of biodegradable polymers through our wholly owned subsidiary  api  and collaborative and contract research and development revenues from our collaborations with third parties and those of our former wholly owned subsidiary  sbs  now merged into durect 
we do not expect the product revenues to increase significantly in future periods 
we do not anticipate commercialization and marketing of our products in development in the near future  and therefore do not expect to generate sufficient revenues to cover expenses or achieve profitability in the near future 
we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future our business currently does not generate sufficient revenues to meet our capital requirements and we do not expect that it will do so in the near future 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds to complete the research  development and clinical testing of our products 
we will require additional funds for these purposes  to establish additional clinical and commercial scale manufacturing arrangements and facilities and to provide for the marketing and distribution of our products 
additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs which would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next months 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued progress and cost of our research and development programs  success in entering into collaboration agreements and meeting milestones under such agreements  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  costs of developing sales  marketing and distribution channels and our ability to sell our products  costs involved in establishing manufacturing capabilities for clinical and commercial quantities of our products  competing technological and market developments  market acceptance of our products  and costs for recruiting and retaining employees and consultants 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  convertible debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  we may have to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our product development efforts  resulting in loss of sales  increased costs  and reduced revenues 
investors may experience substantial dilution of their investment in the past  we have issued and have assumed  pursuant to the sbs acquisition  options and warrants to acquire common stock 
to the extent these outstanding options are ultimately exercised  there will be dilution to investors 
in addition  conversion of some or all of the million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes that we issued in june and july will dilute the ownership interests of investors 
investors may experience further dilution of their investment if we raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities 
see liquidity and capital resources 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow through increased revenues or raising additional capital  then we may not be able to meet our substantial debt obligations 
as of december   we had approximately million in long term convertible subordinated notes   in non current term loan obligations  million in non current bonds payable and  in other long term liabilities 
our substantial indebtedness  which totals million  has and will continue to impact us by making it more difficult to obtain additional financing  and constraining our ability to react quickly in an unfavorable economic climate 
currently we are not generating positive cash flow 
delay in the approval of chronogesic  or other adverse occurrences related to our product development efforts will adversely impact our ability to meet our 
table of contents obligations to repay the principal amounts on our convertible subordinated notes and debentures when due 
in addition  if the market price of our common stock on the due date of our notes is below the equity conversion price of the notes  it will be highly unlikely that the holders of a large percentage of our outstanding convertible subordinated noteswill convert such securities to equity in accordance with their existing terms 
if we are unable to satisfy our debt service requirements  substantial liquidity problems could result 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments valued at approximately million 
we expect to use substantially all of these assets to fund our on going operations over the next few years 
as of december   we had approximately million outstanding convertible subordinated notes  which will mature in june we may not generate sufficient cash from operations to repay our convertible subordinated notes or satisfy any other of these obligations when they become due and may have to raise additional financing from the sale of equity or debt securities or otherwise restructure our obligations in order to do so 
there can be no assurance that any such financing or restructuring will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products and components to support the clinical and commercial requirements of our partners and ourselves at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience we must manufacture our products and components in clinical and commercial quantities  either directly or through third parties  in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
the manufacture of our duros based pharmaceutical systems is a complex process 
although we have completed development of an initial manufacturing process for our chronogesic product  we are currently pursuing necessary enhancements of such manufacturing process to take into account any changes to the system design  satisfy regulatory requirements  improve product performance and quality  increase efficiencies and lower cost 
if we fail to timely complete such necessary manufacturing process enhancements  we will not be able to timely produce product for our clinical trials and commercialization of our chronogesic product 
in the future  we will continue to consider ways to optimize our manufacturing process and to explore possible changes to improve product performance and quality  increase efficiencies and lower costs 
we have also committed to manufacture and supply products or components under a number of our collaborative agreements with third party companies 
we have not yet completed development of the manufacturing process for any products or components other than for the chronogesic product 
if we fail to develop manufacturing processes to permit us to manufacture a product or component at an acceptable cost  then we and our third party partners may not be able to commercialize that product or we may be in breach of our supply obligations to our third party partners 
we completed construction of a manufacturing facility for our duros based pharmaceutical systems in may in accordance with our initial plans  and we expect that this facility will be capable of manufacturing supplies for our phase iii and other clinical trials required for regulatory approval and commercial launch of our chronogesic product and for our other duros based products on a pilot scale 
as of december   we have completed validating and qualifying our manufacturing facility from which we will manufacture supplies of the chronogesic product for our phase iii and other clinical trials once all necessary product design and manufacturing process enhancements have been finalized and implemented 
in the future  we may need to build or acquire other space or facilities for manufacture of products and components for our third party partners and ourselves 
we have limited experience building and validating manufacturing facilities  and we may not be able to timely accomplish these tasks 
in order to manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of our pharmaceutical systems or components for our third party partners or ourselves  we must attain and maintain compliance with applicable federal  state and foreign regulatory standards relating to manufacture of pharmaceutical products which are rigorous  complex and subject to varying interpretations 
furthermore  our facilities will be subject to government audits to determine compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations  and we may be unable to pass inspection with the applicable regulatory agencies or may be asked to undertake corrective measures which may be costly and cause delay 

table of contents if we are unable to manufacture product or components in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost  quality or performance level  and attain and maintain compliance with applicable regulations  the clinical trials and the commercial sale of our pharmaceutical systems and those of our third party partners could be delayed 
additionally  we may need to alter our facility design or manufacturing processes  install additional equipment or do additional construction or testing in order to meet regulatory requirements  optimize the production process  increase efficiencies or production capacity or for other reasons  which may result in additional cost to us or delay production of product needed for the clinical trials and commercial launch of our products and those of our third party partners 
we may also choose to subcontract with third party contractors to perform manufacturing steps of our pharmaceutical systems or components in which case we will be subject to the schedule  expertise and performance of third parties as well as incur significant additional costs 
see we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our products 
under our development and commercialization agreement with alza  we cannot subcontract the manufacture of subassemblies of the duros system components of our duros based pharmaceutical system products to third parties which have not been approved by alza 
if we cannot manufacture product or components in time to meet the clinical or commercial requirements of our partners or ourselves or at an acceptable cost  our operating results will be harmed 
in april  we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza 
we manufacture subassemblies of the alzet product at our vacaville facility 
we currently rely on alza to perform the coating process for the manufacture of the alzet product  but we will be required to perform this process ourselves starting april or sooner 
we have limited experience manufacturing this product  and we may not be able to successfully or consistently manufacture this product at an acceptable cost  if at all 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims which could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and adversely impact our ability to obtain and maintain insurance coverage the testing  manufacture  marketing and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us 
although we are insured against such risks up to a million annual aggregate limit in connection with clinical trials and commercial sales of our products  our present product liability insurance may be inadequate and may not fully cover the costs of any claim or any ultimate damages we might be required to pay 
product liability claims or other claims related to our products  regardless of their outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms 
in addition  product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost 
an inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical systems 
a product liability claim could also significantly harm our reputation and delay market acceptance of our products 
our agreement with alza limits our fields of operation for our duros based pharmaceutical systems and gives alza a first right to negotiate to distribute selected products for us in april  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with alza corporation  which was amended and restated in april  april and october alza was acquired by johnson johnson in june and has since operated as a wholly owned subsidiary 
our agreement with alza gives us exclusive rights to develop  commercialize and manufacture products using alza s duros technology to deliver by catheter drugs to the central nervous system to treat select nervous system disorders  drugs to the middle and inner ear  
table of contents drugs to the pericardial sac of the heart  and select drugs into vascular grafts 
we also have the right to use the duros technology to deliver systemically and by catheter sufentanil to treat chronic pain  and select cancer antigens 
we may not develop  manufacture or commercialize duros based pharmaceutical systems outside of these specific fields without alza s prior approval 
in addition  if we develop or commercialize any drug delivery technology for use in a manner similar to the duros technology in a field covered in our license agreement with alza  then we may lose our exclusive rights to use the duros technology in such field as well as the right to develop new products using duros technology in such field 
in order to maintain commercialization rights for our products on a worldwide basis  we must diligently develop our products  procure required regulatory approvals and commercialize the products in selected major market countries 
if we fail to meet commercialization diligence requirements  we may lose rights for products in some or all countries  including the us these rights would revert to alza  which could then develop duros based pharmaceutical products in such countries itself or license others to do so 
in addition  in the event that our rights terminate with respect to any product or country  or this agreement terminates or expires in its entirety except for termination by us due to a breach by alza  alza will have the exclusive right to use all of our data  rights and information relating to the products developed under the agreement as necessary for alza to commercialize these products  subject to the payment of a royalty to us based on the net sales of the products by alza 
our agreement with alza gives us the right to perform development work and manufacture the duros pump component of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
in the event of a change in our corporate control  including an acquisition of us  our right to manufacture and perform development work on the duros pump would terminate and alza would have the right to manufacture and develop duros systems for us so long as alza can meet our specification and supply requirements following such change in control 
under the alza agreement  we must pay alza royalties on sales of duros based pharmaceutical systems we commercialize and a percentage of any up front license fees  milestone or special fees  payments or other consideration we receive  excluding research and development funding 
in addition  commencing upon the commercial sale of a product developed under the agreement  we are obligated to make minimum product payments to alza on a quarterly basis based on our good faith projections of our net product sales of the product 
these minimum payments will be fully credited against the product royalty payments we must pay to alza 
alza may obtain from us  for its own behalf or on behalf of one of its affiliates  the exclusive right to develop and commercialize a product in a field of use exclusively licensed to us  provided that such product does not incorporate a drug in the same drug class and is not intended for the same therapeutic indication as a product which is then being developed or commercialized by us or for which we have made commitments to a third party 
in the event that alza or an affiliate commercializes such a product  alza or its affiliate will pay us a royalty on sales of such product at a specified rate 
alza also has an exclusive option to distribute any duros based pharmaceutical system we develop to deliver non proprietary cancer antigens worldwide 
the terms of any distribution arrangement have not been set and are to be negotiated in good faith between alza and us 
alza s option to acquire distribution rights limits our ability to negotiate with other distributors for these products and may result in lower payments to us than if these rights were subject to competitive negotiations 
we must allow alza an opportunity to negotiate in good faith for commercialization rights to our products developed under the agreement prior to granting these rights to a third party 
these rights do not apply to products that are subject to alza s option or products for which we have obtained funding or access to a proprietary drug from a third party to whom we have granted commercialization rights prior to the commencement of human clinical trials 

table of contents alza has the right to terminate the agreement in the event that we breach a material obligation under the agreement and do not cure the breach in a timely manner 
in addition  alza has the right to terminate the agreement if at any time prior to july  we solicit for employment or hire  without alza s consent  a person who is or within the previous days has been an employee of alza in the duros technology group 
we may be required to obtain rights to certain drugs some of the pharmaceutical systems that we are currently developing require the use of proprietary drugs to which we do not have commercial rights 
for example  our research collaboration with the university of maastricht has demonstrated that the use of a proprietary angiogenic factor in a pharmaceutical system can lead to elevated local concentration of the angiogenic factor in the pericardial sac of the heart  resulting in physical changes  including the growth of new blood vessels 
we do not currently have a license to develop or commercialize a product containing such proprietary angiogenic factor 
to complete the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical systems containing drugs to which we do not have commercial rights  we will be required to obtain rights to those drugs 
we may not be able to do this at an acceptable cost  if at all 
if we are not able to obtain required rights to commercialize certain drugs  we may not be able to complete the development of pharmaceutical systems which require use of those drugs 
this could result in the cessation of certain development projects and the potential write off of certain assets 
technologies and businesses which we have acquired may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert management attention 
we may also acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future  which could have these same effects we may acquire technologies  products or businesses to broaden the scope of our existing and planned product lines and technologies 
for example  in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets of intraear  inc  in april we acquired the alzet product and related assets from alza  in april  we completed the acquisition of sbs and in august  we acquired apt 
these and our future acquisitions expose us to increased costs associated with the acquisition and operation of the new businesses or technologies and the management of geographically dispersed operations  the risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies  operations  sites and personnel  the diversion of resources from our existing business and technologies  the inability to generate revenues to offset associated acquisition costs  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls  and procedures  and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel 
acquisitions may also result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence or assumption of debt or additional expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets or potential businesses 
past acquisitions  such as our acquisitions of intraear  alzet  sbs and apt  as well future acquisitions  may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
our limited operating history makes evaluating our stock difficult investors can only evaluate our business based on a limited operating history 
we were incorporated in february and have engaged primarily in research and development  licensing technology  raising capital and recruiting scientific and management personnel 
this short history may not be adequate to enable investors to fully assess our ability to successfully develop our products  achieve market acceptance of our products and 
table of contents respond to competition 
furthermore  we anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as pharmaceuticals  drug delivery  and biotechnology 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our products  which may not occur 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
we may require additional funds to complete the development of our products and to fund operating losses to be incurred in the next several years 
acceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain  and failure to achieve market acceptance will delay our ability to generate or grow revenues our future financial performance will depend upon the successful introduction and customer acceptance of our future products  including our chronogesic product and our saber based post operative pain product 
even if approved for marketing  our products may not achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing  the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety and clinical efficacy of our products and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products  including oral medication  transdermal drug delivery products such as drug patches  or external or implantable drug delivery products  and pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors such as insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators 
physicians  patients  payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept  utilize or recommend any of our products 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  commercialize and market our future products when planned and achieve market acceptance  we will not achieve anticipated revenues 
if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors  or if new restrictive legislation is adopted  market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve anticipated revenues the continuing efforts of government and insurance companies  health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability  and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital 
for example  in certain foreign markets  pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control 
in the united states  recent federal and state government initiatives have been directed at lowering the total cost of health care  and the us congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform  the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the medicare and medicaid systems 
while we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted  the announcement or adoption of such proposals could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained by governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations  such as hmos 
third party payors are increasingly limiting payments or reimbursement for medical products and services 
also  the trend toward managed health care in the united states and the concurrent growth of organizations such as hmos  which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and products  as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs  may limit reimbursement or payment for our 
table of contents products 
the cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably 
we do not control alza s ability to develop and commercialize duros technology outside of fields licensed to us  and problems encountered by alza could result in negative publicity  loss of sales and delays in market acceptance of our duros based pharmaceutical systems alza retains complete rights to the duros technology for fields outside the specific fields licensed to us 
accordingly  alza may develop and commercialize duros based products or license others to do so  so long as there is no conflict with the rights granted to us 
alza received fda approval to market its first duros based product  viadur leuprolide acetate implants for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer in march if alza or its commercialization partner  bayer  fails to commercialize this product successfully  or encounters problems associated with this product  negative publicity could be created about all duros based products  which could result in harm to our reputation and cause reduced sales of our products 
in addition  if any third party that may be licensed by alza fails to develop and commercialize duros based products successfully  the success of all duros based systems could be impeded  including ours  resulting in delay or loss of revenue or damage to our reputation  any one of which could harm our business 
we do not own the trademark duros and any competitive advantage we derive from the name may be impaired by third party use alza owns the trademark duros 
because alza is also developing and marketing duros based systems  and may license third parties to do so  there may be confusion in the market between alza  its potential licensees and us  and this confusion could impair the competitive advantage  if any  we derive from use of the duros name 
in addition  any actions taken by alza or its potential licensees that negatively impact the trademark duros could negatively impact our reputation and result in reduced sales of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  particularly because there is substantial uncertainty about the validity and breadth of medical patents we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others 
this risk is exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in medical technology patents and the breadth and scope of trade secret protection involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following  any of which could harm our business or financial results cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming 
if we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third party patents  we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced market share or incur costly litigation to protect our rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
as of december   we held issued us patents and 
table of contents issued foreign patents 
in addition  we have pending us patent applications and have filed patent applications under the patent cooperation treaty  from which national phase applications are currently pending in europe  australia  japan  canada  mexico  new zealand  brazil and china 
our patents expire at various dates starting in the year under our agreement with alza  we must assign to alza any intellectual property rights relating to the duros system and its manufacture and any combination of the duros system with other components  active agents  features or processes 
in addition  alza retains the right to enforce and defend against infringement actions relating to the duros system  and if alza exercises these rights  it will be entitled to the proceeds of these infringement actions 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
in addition  the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued 
consequently  our patent applications or those of alza that are licensed to us may not issue into patents  and any issued patents may not provide protection against competitive technologies or may be held invalid if challenged or circumvented 
our competitors may also independently develop products similar to ours or design around or otherwise circumvent patents issued to us or licensed by us 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as us law 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to execute appropriate confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with us 
these agreements typically provide that all materials and confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances  and that all inventions arising out of the individual s relationship with us shall be our exclusive property 
these agreements may be breached  and in some instances  we may not have an appropriate remedy available for breach of the agreements 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  reverse engineer our information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in trade secrets  technical know how and other non patented technology 
we may have to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary rights is expensive  could cause diversion of our resources and may not prove successful 
any failure to enforce or protect our rights could cause us to lose the ability to exclude others from using our technology to develop or sell competing products 
we rely heavily on third parties to support development  clinical testing and manufacturing of our products we rely on third party contract research organizations  service providers and suppliers to provide critical services to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
for example  we currently depend on third party vendors to perform blood plasma assays in connection with our clinical trials for chronogesic  to perform quality control services related to components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems  and to supply us with molded rubber components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems 
in the past  we relied on chesapeake biological labs  inc to perform the final manufacturing steps of our chronogesic product  and we may choose to rely on a third party manufacturer again 
see we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to support our clinical and commercial requirements at an acceptable cost  and we have limited manufacturing experience 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely on these and other third party contractors to support development  clinical testing  and manufacturing of our pharmaceutical systems 
failure of these contractors to provide the required services in a timely manner or on reasonable commercial terms could materially delay the development and approval of our products  increase our expenses and materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents key components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems are provided by limited numbers of suppliers  and supply shortages or loss of these suppliers could result in interruptions in supply or increased costs certain components and drug substances used in our duros based pharmaceutical systems are currently purchased from a single or a limited number of outside sources 
the reliance on a sole or limited number of suppliers could result in delays associated with redesigning a product due to a failure to obtain a single source component  an inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components  and reduced control over pricing  quality and time delivery 
we have a supply agreement with mallinckrodt  inc for our sufentanil requirements for our chronogesic product  which expires in september additionally  we have a supply agreement with a third party vendor to supply us with titanium components of our duros based pharmaceutical systems until april other than these agreements  we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers  and therefore the supply of a particular component could be terminated at any time without penalty to the supplier 
any interruption in the supply of single source components could cause us to seek alternative sources of supply or manufacture these components internally 
if the supply of any components for our pharmaceutical systems is interrupted  components from alternative suppliers may not be available in sufficient volumes or at acceptable quality levels within required timeframes  if at all  to meet our needs 
this could delay our ability to complete clinical trials and obtain approval for commercialization and marketing of our products  causing us to lose sales  incur additional costs and delay new product introductions and could harm our reputation 
we will not control sales and distribution for our pharmaceutical systems in november  we entered into an agreement with endo pharmaceuticals  inc related to the promotion and distribution of our chronogesic product in the us and canada once it is approved for commercialization 
in addition  we have entered into several agreements with third party companies under which we will collaborate with such companies to develop select pharmaceutical system products and such third parties will have the right to promote and distribute the resulting developed products subject to payments to us in the form of product royalties and other payments 
these agreements make us dependent on third parties to sell and distribute our pharmaceutical systems 
these third parties may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors  which may reduce their interest in selling our products 
in addition  these third parties may terminate these agreements under specified conditions provided in these agreements 
other than these agreements with third party companies  we have yet to establish marketing  sales or distribution capabilities for our pharmaceutical system products 
we compete with many other companies that currently have extensive and well funded marketing and sales operations 
our marketing and sales efforts and those of our third party collaborations may be unable to compete successfully against these other companies 
we may be unable to establish a sufficient sales and marketing organization on a timely basis  if at all 
we may be unable to engage qualified distributors 
even if engaged  these distributors may fail to satisfy financial or contractual obligations to us  fail to adequately market our products  cease operations with little or no notice to us  offer  design  manufacture or promote competing product lines  fail to maintain adequate inventory and thereby restrict use of our products  or build up inventory in excess of demand thereby limiting future purchases or our products resulting in significant quarter to quarter variability in our sales 

table of contents if we fail to develop sales  marketing and distribution channels  we would experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs  which would harm our financial results 
if we are unable to train physicians to use our pharmaceutical systems to treat patients diseases or medical conditions  we may incur delays in market acceptance of our products broad use of our pharmaceutical systems will require extensive training of numerous physicians on the proper and safe use of our products 
the time required to begin and complete training of physicians could delay introduction of our products and adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
we or third parties selling our products may be unable to rapidly train physicians in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our pharmaceutical systems 
any delay in training would materially delay the demand for our systems and harm our business and financial results 
in addition  we may expend significant funds towards such training before any orders are placed for our products  which would increase our expenses and harm our financial results 
some of our products contain controlled substances  the making  use  sale  importation and distribution of which are subject to regulation by state  federal and foreign law enforcement and other regulatory agencies some of our products currently under development contain  and our products in the future may contain  controlled substances which are subject to state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution 
our chronogesic  spinal opioid and oral opiate products under development contain opioids which are classified as schedule ii controlled substances under the regulations of the us drug enforcement agency 
for our products containing controlled substances  we and our suppliers  manufacturers  contractors  customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state  federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state  federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture  use  sale  importation and distribution of controlled substances 
these regulations are extensive and include regulations governing manufacturing  labeling  packaging  testing  dispensing  production and procurement quotas  record keeping  reporting  handling  shipment and disposal 
failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our products containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action 
in addition  because of their restrictive nature  these regulations could limit our commercialization of our products containing controlled substances 
write offs related to the impairment of long lived assets and other non cash charges  as well as future deferred compensation expenses may adversely impact or delay our profitability we may incur significant non cash charges related to impairment write downs of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets 
in  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and assembled workforce on january  however  we will continue to incur non cash charges related to amortization of other intangible assets 
we are required to perform periodic impairment reviews of our goodwill at least annually 
to the extent these reviews conclude that the expected future cash flows generated from our business activities are not sufficient to recover the cost of our long lived assets  we will be required to measure and record an impairment charge to write down these assets to their realizable values 
we completed our initial review during the second quarter of we concluded that our goodwill was fairly stated as of january  and no accounting change adjustment was required 
we performed the annual assessment in the fourth quarter of and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
however  there can be no assurance that upon completion of subsequent reviews a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
if future periodic reviews determine that our assets are impaired and a write down is required  it will adversely impact or delay our profitability 
to date  we have recorded deferred compensation expenses related to stock options grants  including stock options assumed in our acquisition of sbs  which will be amortized through in addition  deferred 
table of contents compensation expense related to option awards to non employees will be calculated during the vesting period of the option based on the then current price of our common stock  which could result in significant charges that adversely impact or delay our profitability 
furthermore  we have issued to alza common stock and a warrant to purchase common stock with an aggregate value of approximately million  which will be amortized over time based on sales of our products and which will also adversely impact or delay our profitability 
we depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time  and we need to hire additional qualified personnel our success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of key management  technical  and scientific personnel  including felix theeuwes  our chairman and chief scientific officer  james e 
brown  our president and chief executive officer and thomas a 
schreck  our chief financial officer 
although we have obtained key man life insurance policies for each of messrs 
theeuwes  brown and schreck in the amount of million  this insurance may not adequately compensate us for the loss of their services 
in addition  our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the process of hiring and integrating such qualified personnel is often lengthy 
we may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis  if at all 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
the loss of the services of key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  could result in delays to product development or approval  loss of sales and diversion of management resources 
we may not successfully manage our growth our success will depend on the timely expansion of our operations and the effective management of growth  which will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
to manage such growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems and hire  train and supervise additional qualified personnel 
if we were unable to manage growth effectively our business would be harmed 
the market for our products is new  rapidly changing and competitive  and new products or technologies developed by others could impair our ability to grow our business and remain competitive the pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
developments by others may render our products under development or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete  or we may be unable to keep pace with technological developments or other market factors 
technological competition in the industry from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than we do  as well as substantially more marketing  manufacturing  financial and managerial resources 
these entities represent significant competition for us 
acquisitions of  or investments in  competing pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies by large corporations could increase such competitors financial  marketing  manufacturing and other resources 
we are a new enterprise and are engaged in the development of novel therapeutic technologies 
as a result  our resources are limited and we may experience technical challenges inherent in such novel technologies 
competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects than our products 
our competitors may develop products that are safer  more effective or less costly than our products and  therefore  present a serious competitive threat to our product offerings 
the widespread acceptance of therapies that are alternatives to ours may limit market acceptance of our products even if commercialized 
chronic pain can also be treated by oral medication  transdermal drug delivery 
table of contents systems  such as drug patches  or with other implantable drug delivery devices 
these treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
the established use of these competitive products may limit the potential for our products to receive widespread acceptance if commercialized 
our business involves environmental risks and risks related to handling regulated substances in connection with our research and development activities and our manufacture of materials and products  we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws  regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development involves the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials  including but not limited to certain hazardous chemicals  solvents  agents and biohazardous materials 
the extent of our use  generation and disposal of such substances has increased substantially since we started manufacturing and selling biodegradable polymers through our subsidiary absorbable polymers international corporation api 
although we believe that our safety procedures for storing  handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
we currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances generated by us  and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances 
the costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large 
in the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use  generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
our corporate headquarters  manufacturing facilities and personnel are located in a geographical area that is seismically active our corporate headquarters  manufacturing facilities and personnel are located in a geographical area that is known to be seismically active and prone to earthquakes 
should such a natural disaster occur  our ability to conduct our business could be severely restricted  and our business and assets  including the results of our research and development efforts  could be destroyed 
our stock price may fluctuate  and your investment in our stock could decline in value the average daily trading volume of our common stock for the twelve months ending december   was  shares

in accordance with our common stock purchase agreement with endo  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec on august  to register  shares of our common stock issued to endo and  shares issued to former apt shareholders for resale 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on september  pursuant to a purchase agreement with morgan stanley co  incorporated  we filed a registration statement with the sec on form s to register an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes for resale on august  the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on november  the convertible subordinated notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment and will bear interest at a rate of per annum 
so long as these registration statements are effective  shares covered thereunder are tradeable without limitation 
if substantial amounts of our common stock were to be sold in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  the existence of our convertible subordinated notes may encourage short selling by 
table of contents market participants 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to factors which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  the market prices of securities of technology and pharmaceutical companies have also been extremely volatile  and have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could result in extreme fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which could cause a decline in the value of our investors stock 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the fundamental change redemption option associated with our outstanding convertible subordinated notes if we engage in any transaction or event in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a united states national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar united states system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices  or  if for any reason  our common stock is no longer listed for trading on a united states national securities exchange nor approved for trading on the nasdaq national market  we may be required to redeem all or part of the notes 
we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered notes 
in addition  any credit agreement or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain provisions prohibiting redemption of the notes under certain circumstances  or expressly prohibit our redemption of the notes upon a designated event or may provide that a designated event constitutes an event of default under that agreement 
our failure to redeem tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture  which might also constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness 
the fundamental change redemption rights in our outstanding convertible subordinated notes could discourage a potential acquirer if we engage in any transaction or event in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration which is not all or substantially all common stock listed on a united states national securities exchange or approved for quotation on the nasdaq national market or any similar united states system of automated dissemination of quotations of securities prices  or  if for any reason  our common stock is no longer listed for trading on a united states national securities exchange nor approved for trading on the nasdaq national market a fundamental change  we may be required to redeem all or part of the notes and this could discourage a potential acquirer 
however  this redemption feature is not the result of management s knowledge of any specific effort to obtain control of us by means of a merger  tender offer or solicitation  or part of a plan by management to adopt a series of anti takeover provisions 
the term fundamental change is limited to specified transactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or business operations 
our obligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford you protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction  reorganization  merger or similar transaction involving us 
we have broad discretion over the use of our cash and investments  and their investment may not yield a favorable return our management has broad discretion over how our cash and investments are used and may invest in ways with which our stockholders may not agree and that do not yield favorable returns

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities  auction rate securities  corporate bonds and market auction preferreds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
