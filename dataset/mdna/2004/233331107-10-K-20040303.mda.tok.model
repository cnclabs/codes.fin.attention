item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dte energy is a diversified energy company with approximately billion in revenues in and approximately billion in assets at december  we are the parent company of detroit edison and michcon  regulated electric and gas utilities engaged primarily in the business of providing electricity and natural gas sales and distribution services throughout southeastern michigan 
additionally  we have numerous non regulated subsidiaries involved in energy related businesses predominantly in the midwest and eastern us the majority of our earnings are derived from utility operations and the production of synthetic fuel  which qualifies for section tax credits 
earnings in were million  or per diluted share  down from earnings of million  or per diluted share 
earnings from continuing operations in were million  or per diluted share  compared to earnings from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share 
the decrease in income reflects significantly lower utility earnings  partially offset by increased contributions from our non regulated businesses 
our financial performance was primarily influenced by weather  including storms and power outages  lost revenues from electric customer choice penetration  the regulatory environment in michigan and the need to increase utility rates  higher operating costs  the optimization of section tax credits  and growth of non regulated businesses weather earnings in our electric and gas utilities are seasonal and extremely sensitive to weather 
electric utility earnings are dependent on hot summer weather while the gas utility s results are driven by cold winter weather 
we experienced both milder summer and winter weather during  which negatively impacted sales demand 
the lower demand reduced current year earnings by million compared to  which was an above normal weather demand year 
additionally  we occasionally experience various types of storms that damage our electric distribution infrastructure resulting in power outages 
our current year earnings were affected by several catastrophic wind and ice storms  as well as by the august blackout 
restoration and other costs associated with these power outages lowered earnings by an additional million compared to electric customer choice program the electric customer choice program as originally structured in michigan anticipated an eventual transition to a totally deregulated and competitive environment where customers would be charged market based rates for their electricity 
however  detroit edison s rates continue to be regulated by the mpsc  while alternative suppliers can charge market based rates 
this continued regulation has hindered detroit edison s ability to retain customers 
detroit edison s results have been unfavorably impacted by the lack of recovery of lost margins and other costs associated with the electric customer choice program 
under michigan legislation  we are allowed to recover net stranded costs associated with the electric customer choice program 
to date  the mpsc has not fully implemented various provisions of michigan s restructuring legislation 
specifically  the mpsc has not finalized all the components for calculating net stranded costs  has created a process whereby net stranded costs would be recovered two years after the costs were actually incurred  has not authorized timely recovery of any implementation costs associated with the electric customer choice program  and has created artificial incentives to encourage participation in the electric customer choice program in addition  the mpsc has maintained regulated rates for certain groups of customers that exceed the cost of service to those customers 
this has resulted in high levels of participation in the electric customer choice program by those customers that have the highest price relative to their cost of service 
as a result  we continue to lose sales each year and are seeing an accelerating pace of migration towards the end of lost margins and electricity volumes associated with electric customer choice were 
table of contents approximately million and  gigawatthour gwh in  compared with million and  gwh in in february  the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase that recognized a revenue deficiency for lost choice revenues  and eliminated transition credits and implemented a transition charge for choice customers 
the interim order is expected to reduce the level of choice sales volumes 
assuming no further changes to the current electric customer choice program  we expect to continue losing margins and volumes in partially offsetting the impact of lost margins in  we recorded regulatory assets of million representing an estimate of stranded costs that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation 
based on the mpsc s july order  we do not believe that any of the stranded costs in years prior to are recoverable 
there are a number of variables and estimates that impact the level of recoverable stranded costs  including weather  sales mix and wholesale prices 
as a result  our estimate of stranded costs could increase or decrease 
the actual amount of stranded costs to be recovered will ultimately be determined by the mpsc 
detroit edison addressed numerous issues with the electric customer choice program  including stranded costs  in its june rate filing and is also pursuing a legislative solution 
under the legislative solution  we are proposing to limit customer choice program participation to customers whose electric demand is mw or greater 
the continued delay in addressing the structural problems of the electric customer choice program and the timely and full recovery of stranded costs  unfavorably impacts earnings and cash flow 
see note for a further discussion of the electric customer choice program and the mpsc interim rate order 
electric and gas rate plans in  michigan legislation froze electric rates for all residential  commercial and industrial customers through the legislation also prevented rate increases or capped rates for residential customers through  and for small commercial and industrial customers through the rate freeze and caps apply to base rates as well as rates designed to recover fuel and purchased power costs 
historically  these costs have been a pass through under the power supply cost recovery pscr mechanism 
in june  detroit edison filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in retail electric rates of million annually  the resumption of the pscr mechanism  and the recovery of net stranded and other costs as permitted under michigan legislation 
detroit edison received an interim order in this rate case authorizing an increase in rates of million annually 
as a result of rate caps and other factors  the interim rate increase is only designed to increase revenues by million in note 
a final order is expected in the third quarter of the rate increase is effective for each customer class upon the expiration of the applicable rate cap period 
the rate request is designed to more accurately reflect  among other things  significantly higher cost of service levels that detroit edison has experienced over the past few years 
the recovery of net stranded costs  electric customer choice implementation costs and other costs incurred as a result of changes in taxes  laws and governmental actions are covered under michigan legislation 
however  the mpsc has not approved a final mechanism to recover such costs  and this has negatively affected our cash flow 
as part of its rate filing  detroit edison has requested authorization to implement a year surcharge to recover these costs 
the mpsc deferred addressing this item until a final rate order is issued 
in september  michcon filed an application with the mpsc for an increase in service and distribution charges for its gas sales and transportation customers totaling million annually 
the rate increase would be michcon s first since  and is designed to recover significantly higher operating costs 
michcon expects an interim order in this case in mid  with a final order by january operating costs during  we experienced double digit increases in regulated operation and maintenance costs 
the increases were driven by higher costs associated with pension and health care benefits  uncollectable accounts receivable and customer service initiatives 
to address this issue of rising costs  we implemented several cost savings initiatives that partially offset these increases 
some of the initiatives were structural in nature  whereas others were temporary 
examples of these initiatives included a hiring freeze  a pause on discretionary spending and overtime restrictions 
additionally  we 
table of contents reduced employee compensation costs  property and other taxes as well as interest costs through debt refinancings 
synthetic fuel operations we operate nine synthetic fuel production plants at eight locations 
interests in two of the nine plants were sold in  interests in three other plants were sold in november  and additional interests were sold in january in two of the plants sold in we continue to wholly own the remaining four plants  but intend to sell interests in all such plants in synfuel facilities chemically change coal  including waste and marginal coal  into a synthetic fuel as determined under applicable irs rules 
section of the internal revenue code provides tax credits for the production and sale of solid synthetic fuel produced from coal 
in addition to meeting various qualifying conditions  a taxpayer must have sufficient taxable income to earn the section credits 
our earnings were unfavorably affected by our inability to sell interests in synfuel plants until late the irs suspended the issuance of private letter rulings plrs relating to synthetic fuel projects in may  pending its review of issues concerning chemical change  which is the basis for earning section tax credits 
as a result of the irs suspension  we were unable to complete the pending sale of interests in our synfuel projects 
in addition  we experienced lower taxable earnings due to milder weather and continued cost and margin pressures 
the temporary delay in selling interests in the synfuel projects  coupled with the lower taxable earnings  resulted in our capacity to generate more credits than we could utilize 
these factors caused us to reduce our synthetic fuel production by approximately one half in june to optimize the tax credits generated from these facilities 
we began implementing a series of initiatives  including the monetization of in the money gas swap derivative contracts  to improve cash flow and increase taxable income thereby allowing us to more fully utilize our section tax credits 
in october  the irs concluded its assessment of the chemical change process involved in synfuel production and resumed issuing plrs 
the irs determined that the test procedures and results used by taxpayers were scientifically valid if the procedures were applied in a consistent and unbiased manner 
the conclusion of the irs assessment allowed us to complete the sale of interests in additional facilities and increase synfuel production levels for the balance of non regulated growth during  we continued to experience growth in our non regulated businesses with income reaching million compared to million in the significant improvement reflects increased contributions from our energy services segment due to higher synfuel production  partially offset by the impact of certain coke battery related section tax credits expiring in additionally  non regulated growth in is attributable to increased margins in our energy marketing trading segment 
we also realized gains in from the sale of our interest in the portland natural gas transmission system  an interstate pipeline company  and the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our merchant generating facilities 
although dte energy s overall earnings were down in  our cash from operations totaling million was comparable to the prior year despite a million cash contribution to our pension plan 
operating cash flow reflects our successful initiative in to conserve cash  including better working capital management 
this initiative coupled with million in lower capital expenditures and over million from selling non strategic and other assets  resulted in a lower debt to total capital ratio and a healthier balance sheet 
outlook we are facing many challenges in to maintain earnings and cash flow levels  while protecting a strong balance sheet 
our financial performance over the short term will be dependent on preserving healthy electric and gas utilities  monetizing our synthetic fuel projects and continuing to grow our non regulated businesses in a prudent manner 
remedying the structural issues of the electric customer choice program in michigan is a key priority for the organization 
these issues must be corrected to prevent the continued migration of customers to the choice program based on false market signals 
the potential implications to remaining customers over the longer term could be significantly higher electricity rates 

table of contents the timing and ultimate amount of final rate relief granted in the current electric and gas rate cases will affect customer service levels and our financial performance 
cash flow and earnings from our utilities will remain under pressure until the regulatory uncertainties are resolved 
however  we remain focused on good cash management and a healthy balance sheet 
we are aggressively pursuing the sales of interests in all of our remaining synthetic fuel projects in these sales  in addition to previously completed sales  are expected to provide a million to million boost to our cash flow in the availability of qualified buyers and the timing of these sales will impact this financial outcome 
in addition  we are continuing to grow our non regulated businesses in areas such as waste coal technologies  coal bed methane production and on site energy project development 
due to the regulatory uncertainties over the short term  we remain disciplined and conservative in our pursuit of incremental growth investments 
results of operations we had income of million in  or per diluted share  compared to income of million  or per diluted share in and income of million  or per diluted share in the comparability of earnings was impacted by the sale of our transmission business  international transmission company itc  and the adoption of new accounting rules as subsequently discussed 
upon selling itc in february  we classified this business as a discontinued operation 
excluding discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of accounting changes  our earnings from continuing operations in were million  or per diluted share  compared to earnings of million  or per diluted share in and earnings of million  or per diluted share in the following sections provide a detailed discussion of our segments  operating performance and future outlook 
segment performance outlook we operate our businesses through three strategic business units energy resources  energy distribution and energy gas 
each business unit has regulated and non regulated operations 
the balance of our business consists of corporate other 
based on this structure  we set strategic goals  allocate resources and evaluate performance

as subsequently discussed  these results primarily reflect changes in gross margins  increased operation and maintenance expenses and the recording of higher regulatory deferrals  which lowered depreciation and amortization expenses 
merger and restructuring charges associated with the mcn energy acquisition also impacted the comparability of results 
these charges represent costs associated with systems integration  relocation  legal  accounting and consulting services  as well as costs associated with a work force reduction plan 
the plan included early retirement incentives and voluntary separation agreements for employees in overlapping corporate support areas 
gross margins in declined million due primarily to decreased cooling demand resulting from mild summer weather  lost margins from customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program and lost margins from the august blackout 
weather in was milder than resulting in lost margins of million 
detroit edison lost of retail sales in and of such sales in as a result of customers choosing to purchase power from alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program 
we estimate that we lost million of margins in under the electric customer choice program  an increase of million over lost choice margins that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation are recorded as regulatory assets and therefore reduced depreciation and amortization expense as subsequently discussed 
gross margins benefited from a 
per mwh decline in fuel and purchased power costs reflecting the use of a more favorable power supply mix 
the favorable mix is due to lower purchases  which is driven by lost sales under the electric customer choice program 
gross margins in improved million due primarily to significantly lower fuel and purchased power costs  partially offset by reduced operating revenues 
the reduction in fuel and purchased power costs was driven by a per mwh reduction in average purchased power prices from levels 
the decline in operating revenues is attributable to commercial  industrial and wholesale customers 
commercial and industrial revenues were lower due to a full year s impact of a legislatively mandated rate reduction for customers that began in april additionally  revenues from these retail customers were affected by customers switching to alternative suppliers under the electric customer choice program 
revenues from wholesale customers were reduced  reflecting lower power prices 
partially offsetting these revenue reductions was the impact of weather  resulting in a increase in cooling demand during

operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in operation and maintenance expenses in were affected by million in costs associated with the august blackout note and a million increase in employee pension and health care benefit costs  due to recent financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates 
partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system  our company wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies as well as enhance operating performance 
the dte operating system involves the application of tools and operating practices  which have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems  among other enhancements 
operation and maintenance expenses in also benefited from million in sales of emissions credits and lower employee incentive costs 
operation and maintenance expenses in reflect million in higher employee pension and health care benefit costs and million in expenses associated with maintaining our generation fleet 
the increase also includes a million increase in allocations for corporate support services  as well as million to fund the low income and energy efficiency fund 
the funding of the low income and energy efficiency program was required under michigan legislation and is recovered in current sales rates 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in and million in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to the income effect of recording regulatory assets totaling million in and million in representing the deferral of net stranded and other costs we believe are recoverable under public act the decline in also reflects the extension of the amortization period from seven years to years for certain regulatory assets that were securitized in see note regulatory matters 
partially offsetting these declines was increased depreciation associated with generation related capital expenditures 
other income and deductions declined million in and increased million in the reduction in is attributable to lower interest expense and increased interest income 
interest expense reflects lower borrowing levels and rates  and interest income includes the accrual of carrying charges on environmental related regulatory assets 
outlook future operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings  new legislation  changes in market prices of power  changes in economic conditions and the levels of customer participation in the electric customer choice program 
as previously discussed  we expect to continue losing retail sales and margins in future years under the electric customer choice program until the inequities associated with this program are addressed 
we will accrue as regulatory assets our unrecovered generation related fixed costs due to electric customer choice that we believe are recoverable under michigan legislation 
we have addressed the issue of stranded costs in our june electric rate filing and are also pursuing a legislative solution 
additionally  we requested an increase in retail electric rates of million annually to recover higher operating costs and the resumption of the pscr mechanism 
in february  the mpsc authorized an interim base rate increase of million annually 
the actual timing and level of recovering stranded and operating costs will ultimately be determined by the mpsc or legislation 
we cannot predict the outcome of these matters

table of contents energy services energy services is comprised of coal based fuels  on site energy projects and merchant generation 
coal based fuels operations include producing synthetic fuel from nine synfuel plants and producing coke from three coke battery plants 
both processes generate tax credits under section of the internal revenue code 
on site energy projects include pulverized coal injection  power generation  steam production  chilled water production  wastewater treatment and compressed air supply 
merchant generation owns and operates four gas fired peaking electric generating plants and develops and acquires gas and coal fired generation

as subsequently discussed  these results primarily reflect increases in synfuel production  varying levels of section tax credits  a one time contract gain and a write off of an uncollectable account 
operating revenues increased million in and million in reflecting higher synfuel production due to a greater number of operating synfuel plants 
all nine of our synfuel plants were operational throughout  whereas only five were operational throughout and only two in as discussed in note  the growth in synfuel revenues was tempered by our decision to reduce synfuel production by approximately one half in june also impacting the comparison was reduced generation revenue due to the settlement of a tolling contract at one of our generating facilities 
dollars in millions coal based fuels statistics synfuel plants operational at end of year tax credits generated coke battery plants operational at end of year tax credits generated dte energy s portion of total tax credits generated 
table of contents operation and maintenance expense increased million in and million in  reflecting costs associated with the higher levels of synfuel production 
operating expenses associated with synfuel projects exceed operating revenues and therefore generate operating losses  which are more than offset by the resulting section tax credits 
operation and maintenance expense in also includes a million net of tax write off for an uncollectable receivable associated with a large customer bankruptcy 
partially offsetting these increases was a one time million net of tax gain from the settlement of the tolling contract 
other income and deductions increased million in and million in the increases reflect our minority partners share of operating losses associated with synfuel operations 
the sale of interests in our synfuel facilities during and resulted in our minority partners being allocated a larger percentage of such losses 
income tax benefits decreased million in and increased million in income tax variations reflect changes in taxable earnings and the level of section tax credits from our synfuel and coke battery facilities 
tax credits from our synfuel operations increased in each of the last two years due to higher synfuel production 
tax credits from our coke battery production reflect the expiration of such credits at two of our three plants in additionally  tax credits were impacted by our interest in one of the coke battery projects being reduced from to in  consistent with the original purchase and sale agreement 
outlook a significant portion of energy services earnings consist of section tax credits 
synfuel related tax credits expire in tax credits for two of our three coke batteries expired at the end of  and the third expires in we are aggressively pursuing opportunities to sell interests in all of our synfuel plants in the level of tax credits generated in future periods will be affected by the timing and number of synfuel projects sold 
when we sell an interest in a synfuel facility  we recognize the gain from such sale under the installment method of accounting 
gain recognition is dependent on the synfuel production qualifying for section tax credits 
in substance  we are receiving installment gains and reduced operating losses in exchange for tax credits 
sales of interests in synfuel projects allow us to accelerate cash flow while maintaining a stable income base 
there is a bill currently before the united states congress that includes provisions extending or reinstating tax credits for various types of energy facilities and processes  including coke batteries  antrim shale gas  coal bed methane  refined coal and landfill gas 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the legislative process 
energy services will continue leveraging its extensive energy related operating experience and project management capability to develop and grow the on site energy business 
we continue to explore growth opportunities that will not require significant initial capital investment 
we are currently negotiating an on site energy business arrangement with a major manufacturer in the midwest 
power prices over the past few years have been low due  in part  to the current excess capacity in the generation industry 
additionally  the generation tolling agreement that was settled in was at above market rates 
as a result of these factors  we expect lower revenues and earnings from our merchant generation business in energy marketing trading energy marketing trading consists of the electric and gas marketing and trading operations of dte energy trading and coenergy 
dte energy trading focuses on physical power marketing and 
table of contents structured transactions  as well as the enhancement of returns from dte energy s power plants 
coenergy focuses on physical gas marketing and the optimization of dte energy s owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and gas storage capacity 
to this end  both companies enter into derivative financial instruments as part of their strategies  including forwards  futures  swaps and option contracts 
the derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method  which results in earnings recognition of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives 
factors impacting income energy marketing trading s earnings increased million in  of which million was attributable to dte energy trading and million to coenergy 
earnings for decreased million  consisting of a million improvement at dte energy trading  which was more than offset by a million reduction at coenergy 
dte energy trading s earnings improvement in and was due mainly to margins associated with short term physical trading and origination activities 
the improvement was partially offset by reduced proprietary trading profits 
proprietary trading represents derivative activity transacted with the intent of capturing profits on forward price movements 
dollars in millions dte energy trading margins gains losses realized unrealized operating and other costs income taxes net income coenergy margins gains losses realized unrealized unrealized gas in inventory operating and other costs income taxes net income total energy marketing trading net income realized margins include the settlement of all derivative and non derivative contracts  as well as the amortization of deferred assets and liabilities 
unrealized margins include mark to market gains and losses on derivative contracts  net of gains and losses reclassified to realized 
see fair value of contracts section that follows 
unrealized gas in inventory margins represent gains and losses associated with fair value accounting in and coenergy changed its method of accounting for inventory in january note 
coenergy s earnings in and were driven by varying levels of operating costs and margins 
operating costs reflect the scale back of certain retail gas marketing operations in as well as lower allocations for corporate support services in variations in margins reflect the settling or monetizing of certain in the money derivative contracts in  a change in the method of accounting for our gas in inventory in january  and volatility related to the accounting for our production related gas supply contracts in we monetized certain in the money derivative contracts in while simultaneously entering into replacement at the market contracts with various counterparties 
the monetizations were completed in conjunction with implementing a series of initiatives to improve cash flow as well as our ability to fully 
table of contents utilize section tax credits note 
the monetizations had the impact of reducing unrealized gains and increasing realized gains by approximately million  with no significant impact on earnings 
as previously discussed  our derivative financial instruments are accounted for under the mark to market method  including those derivatives that hedge our price risk exposure associated with gas in inventory 
through december  our physical gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price under fair value accounting rules 
accordingly  mark to market accounting for derivatives  coupled with fair value accounting for gas in inventory  minimized earnings mismatches 
to comply with new accounting requirements resulting from the rescission of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  we changed to the average cost method for our gas inventories  effective january note 
as a result  coenergy experienced earnings volatility as it recorded unrealized gains in and unrealized losses in from fair valuing its inventory  whereas no such gains or losses were recorded in the comparability of coenergy s results was also affected by using different market prices for fair valuing its derivatives and fair valuing its gas in inventory  before the accounting change 
derivatives are marked to market against the forward curve  whereas gas in inventory was marked to the current spot price 
the difference in accounting for derivatives and gas in storage resulted in earnings volatility in and when price changes in the spot month did not correspond with those in the forward market 
gas in storage in december was priced at a spot market rate of mcf  compared to per mcf in december and a may   acquisition date rate of per mcf 
significantly smaller changes in forward prices occurred during these same periods 
as a result  the mark to market gains and losses on gas inventory were only partially offset by mark to market losses and gains on the storage related derivatives 
coenergy receives gas produced from dte energy s gas production operations  which is used to meet its commitments under long term contracts with cogeneration customers 
the gas produced does not qualify for mark to market accounting 
coenergy recorded a gain in totaling approximately million  net of taxes  primarily attributable to marking to market sales contracts with power generation customers without recording an offsetting loss from marking to market the production related gas supply 
in december  coenergy entered into hedge transactions that substantially mitigate the earnings volatility related to the gas contracts with power generation customers 
outlook energy marketing trading will seek to manage its business in a manner consistent with and complementary to the growth of our other business segments 
gas storage and transportation capacity enhances our ability to provide reliable and custom tailored bundled services to large volume end users and utilities 
this capacity  coupled with the synergies from dte energy s other businesses  positions the segment to add value 
significant portions of the energy marketing trading portfolio are economically hedged  and include financial instruments  gas inventory  as well as owned and contracted natural gas pipelines and storage assets 
these financial instruments are deemed derivatives whereas the gas inventory  pipelines and storage assets are not considered derivatives for accounting purposes 
as a result  energy marketing trading will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked to market without revaluing the underlying non derivative contracts and assets 
a significant portion of the earnings volatility in this segment is associated with the natural gas storage cycle  which runs from june to march 
injections of gas into inventory takes place in the summer and gas is withdrawn in the winter 
dte energy s policy is to hedge the price risk of all purchases for storage with sales in the over the counter and futures markets  eliminating the price risk for the storage business 
as previously discussed  current accounting rules do allow for the marking to market of forward sales  but do not allow for the marking to market of the related gas inventory 
this results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim periods  but even out by the end of the storage cycle 

table of contents in february  we terminated a long term gas exchange agreement and modified our future purchase commitments under a related transportation agreement with an interstate pipeline company  effective march  the agreements were at rates that were not reflective of current market conditions and had been fair valued under generally accepted accounting principles 
in  the fair value of the transportation agreement was frozen when it no longer met the definition of a derivative as a result of ferc order the fair value amounts were being amortized to income over the life of the related agreements  representing a net liability of approximately million as of december  we are currently negotiating new agreements with the interstate pipeline company 
we will record an appropriate adjustment to the liability after all related agreements have been finalized 
non regulated other our other non regulated businesses are comprised of our coal services and biomass units 
coal services provides fuel  transportation and equipment management services

coal services has formed a subsidiary  dte peptec inc  that uses proprietary technology to produce high quality coal products from fine coal slurries that are typically discarded from coal mining operations 
biomass develops  owns and operates landfill recovery systems in the us gas produced from these landfill sites qualifies for section tax credits

partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system  as previously discussed  and lower employee incentive costs 
taxes other than income decreased million in and million in the decline in is due to lower michigan single business taxes  reflecting reduced taxable earnings  and lower property taxes 
outlook operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as weather  changes in economic conditions and the severity and frequency of storms 
economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results 
as a result  we have organized a focused effort to address the credit and collection issues 
we experienced numerous catastrophic storms over the past few years 
the effect of the storms on annual earnings ranged up to million and was partially offset by storm insurance 
we were unable to obtain storm insurance at economical rates in and as a result  we do not anticipate having insurance coverage at levels that would significantly offset unplanned expenses from ice storms  tornadoes  or high winds that damage our distribution infrastructure

the pro forma impact of the mcn energy acquisition on dte energy is discussed in note acquisitions and dispositions 
gross margins declined million in reflecting a million reserve for the potential disallowance in gas costs pursuant to a march mpsc order in michcon s gcr plan case note 
the impact of the reserve was significantly offset by increased sales due to colder winter weather in early operation and maintenance expense increased million in reflecting higher costs associated with employee benefits  uncollectable accounts receivables  allocations for corporate support services  and customer service initiatives 
employee pension and health care benefit costs increased million in and uncollectable accounts expense increased million in reflecting economic conditions and higher gas prices 
partially offsetting these increases were benefits from the dte operating system  as previously discussed  and lower employee incentive costs 
income taxes in were impacted by lower earnings and favorably affected by an increase in the amortization of tax benefits previously deferred in accordance with mpsc regulations 
outlook operating results are expected to vary as a result of external factors such as regulatory proceedings  weather and changes in economic conditions 
higher gas prices  current economic conditions and prior billing issues have resulted in an increase in past due receivables 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results 
as previously discussed  we are focused on addressing the credit and collection issues 
the mpsc issued several orders that continue the gas customer choice program on a permanent basis 
since michcon continues to transport and deliver the gas to the participating customer premises at prices comparable to margins earned on gas sales  customers switching to other suppliers have little impact on michcon s earnings 
as of december  approximately  customers were participating in the gas customer choice program  compared with approximately  customers as of december as a result of the continued increase in operating costs  michcon filed a rate case in september to increase rates by million annually to address future operating costs and other issues 
see note regulatory matters 

table of contents non regulated non regulated operations include the gas production business and the gas storage  pipelines processing business 
our gas production business produces gas from proven reserves in northern michigan and sells the gas to the energy marketing trading segment 
gas storage  pipelines processing has a partnership interest in an interstate transmission pipeline  seven carbon dioxide processing facilities and a natural gas storage field  as well as lease rights to another natural gas storage field 
the assets of these businesses are well integrated with other dte energy entities 
factors impacting income earnings increased million in and million in the earnings improvement primarily reflects the gain from the sale of our pipeline interest in the portland natural gas transmission system 
the results reflect a full year of operations of the our non regulated gas businesses that were acquired in conjunction with the mcn energy acquisition in may outlook we expect to further develop our gas production properties in northern michigan and our pipelines  processing and storage assets to support other dte energy businesses 
in october  we acquired an additional interest in the vector pipeline  bringing our total ownership interest to 
the purchase of the additional interest in the vector pipeline complements our existing gas distribution and storage facilities in michigan 
additionally  we expect to continue to invest in opportunities in the coal bed methane business to leverage our production  coal and low cost operating capabilities 
corporate other corporate other includes the administrative and general expenses of various corporate support functions such as accounting  legal and information technology 
as these functions essentially support the entire company  they are allocated to the various segments based on services utilized and therefore can vary from year to year 
additionally  corporate other holds certain non regulated debt and investments  including assets held for sale and in emerging energy technologies 
factors impacting income corporate other s losses were basically flat in and the results were affected by a million cash contribution to the dte energy foundation that was funded with proceeds received from the sale of itc note 
the impact of the contribution was offset by lower interest costs 
results in reflect higher interest expense resulting from increased debt and a full year s impact of corporate debt assumed in the mcn energy acquisition 
additionally  results reflect a reserve of million pre tax for the possible loss associated with direct loans to and the guarantee of debt of a technology investment 
losses in include the amortization of goodwill associated with the mcn energy acquisition 
discontinued operations itc in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts co 
and trimaran capital partners  llc to sell itc for million in cash 
the sale closed on february  following approval of the transaction by the ferc and resolution of all other contingencies and generated a net of tax gain of million 
prior to may   detroit edison owned and operated the transmission assets of itc  which were vertically integrated with its other operations 
accordingly  revenues  expenses and cash flows associated with these transmission assets were bundled with detroit edison s power distribution operations 
significant changes in regulation over the past few years required detroit edison to cede operating control of its transmission assets to an independent system operator or to sell its transmission assets 
in response to these new requirements we formed itc and transferred our transmission assets to this wholly owned subsidiary with the intent of divesting itc 
effective june   the transmission assets of itc were transferred to dte corporate and its revenues  expenses and cash flows were separately monitored to measure its financial and operating performance 
accordingly  the presentation of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations reflects the results of itc after may  the 
table of contents financial results of the transmission business prior to june  are included as part of the power distribution segment 
cumulative effect of accounting changes as required by generally accepted accounting principles  on january   we adopted new accounting rules for asset retirement obligations and energy trading activities 
the cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting rules reduced earnings by million 
additionally  on january  we adopted a new accounting rule for derivative instruments and the cumulative effect of adopting this new rule increased earnings by million

table of contents operating activities we use cash derived from operating activities to maintain and expand our electric and gas utilities and to grow our non regulated businesses 
in addition  we use cash from operations to retire long term debt and pay dividends 
a majority of the company s operating cash flow is provided by the two regulated utilities  which are significantly influenced by factors such as weather  customer choice sales loss  regulatory outcomes  economic conditions and operating costs 
this part of our business has recently been under considerable financial pressure given that we have not had a rate increase in over years  coupled with higher operating costs and increased regulatory deferrals 
while these regulatory deferrals at detroit edison have served to mitigate some of the earnings pressures as a result of these influencing factors  the corresponding cash flows have been deferred 
our non regulated businesses also provide sources of cash flow to the enterprise and reflect a range of operating profiles 
these vary from our synthetic fuels business  which will provide substantial cash flow over the next years  to new start ups  such as our coal bed methane or waste coal recovery businesses  which are growing and will require modest investments beyond their cash generation capabilities 
during  our consolidated net cash from operating activities was million  reflecting a decrease of million from levels 
the decrease in operating cash flow was attributable to declines in regulated net income  after adjusting for noncash items depreciation  depletion  amortization  deferred taxes and gains  reflecting the impacts of weather  lost electric customer choice margins and higher operating costs 
partially offsetting these declines were lower working capital and other requirements reflecting a company wide initiative focused on improving cash flow 
the initiative included better inventory management  improved accounts receivable collections  the selling of interests in our synfuel facilities  the monetization of in the money derivatives and replacing margin deposits with letters of credit 
the improvement in working capital was achieved despite a million contribution to our pension plan 
operating cash flow in of million was million higher than levels  largely attributable to the full year s impact of the mcn energy acquisition  which was completed in may lower working capital and other requirements were partially offset by a decline in net income  after adjusting for noncash items 
working capital reflects the seasonal requirements of the gas business where cash is used in the second half of the year to finance increases in gas inventories and customer accounts receivable 
additionally  past due accounts receivable balances increased due to higher gas prices  economic conditions and conversion issues with the new combined utility billing system 
outlook we expect cash flow from operations to increase over the long term  but to remain relatively the same in as cash flow improvements from utility rate increases and synfuel sales will be offset by higher cash requirements primarily within our energy marketing and trading business 
operating cash flow from our utilities is expected to increase in  but will be affected by the level of sales migration under the electric customer choice program and the ability of the mpsc within the regulatory processes to put in place a choice program that has sound economic fundamentals 
in addition  the choice program s impact will also be determined by the success of the company in addressing certain structural flaws within the legislative process 
while the choice program s shortfalls may be structurally addressed within these two processes  the use of regulatory deferrals by the mpsc might affect the cash benefits of addressing the existing choice program being realized in another factor affecting regulated cash flows is the degree and timing of rate relief within the electric and gas rate cases 
based on the interim order issued by the mpsc on february   approximately million of additional revenues should be realized within the calendar year 
due to the structure of the interim rate order  we will not realize the full benefits of interim and final rate relief until when customer rate caps expire 
improvements in cash flow from our utilities are also expected from better managing our working capital requirements  including the continued focus of reducing past due accounts receivables 
our emphasis in these businesses will continue to be centered around cash generation and conservation given the regulatory uncertainties 
cash flow from our synfuel business  including proceeds from the sale of interests in related facilities  should shift from a net cash loss of million in to positive cash flow of million in and million in the expected improvements are driven by the sale of interests in synfuel facilities  increased production and a higher cash value per credit 
we will also benefit from lower taxes paid as we use our tax credit carry forward position 
our other operating non regulated businesses will provide minimal cash from operations in and grow modestly in future years 
remaining start up businesses such as coal bed methane  waste coal recovery and distributed generation will have cash losses over the next couple of years while they are being further developed 
certain of the cash initiatives previously discussed  resulted in accelerating the receipt of cash in which will have the impact of lowering cash flow in 
table of contents investing activities cash inflows associated with investing activities are partially generated from the sale of assets and utilized to invest in our utilities and non regulated businesses 
in any given year  we will look to harvest cash from under performing or non strategic assets 
capital spending within the utility business is primarily to maintain our generation and distribution infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations 
we have incurred higher utility capital expenditures over the past several years to comply with new air quality standards 
capital spending within our non regulated businesses should be viewed in two categories 
for businesses currently operating  expenditures are for ongoing maintenance and some expansion 
the balance of non regulated spending is for growth  which we manage very carefully 
we look to make investments that meet strict criteria in terms of strategy  management skills  risks and returns 
all new investments are analyzed for their rates of return and cash payback on a risk adjusted basis 
we have been disciplined in how we deploy capital and will not make investments unless they meet our criteria 
for new business lines  we invest tentatively based on research and analysis 
based on a limited investment  we evaluate results and either expand or exit the business based on those results 
in any given year  the amount of growth capital will be determined by the underlying cash flows of the company with a clear understanding of any potential impact on our credit ratings 
during  we had net cash from investing activities of million compared to cash used of billion in the significant improvement was due to proceeds totaling million from the sale of itc  interests in three synfuel projects and non strategic assets that were acquired as part of the mcn energy acquisition 
additionally  regulated and non regulated plant expenditures decreased significantly in lower regulated expenditures of million were associated with air quality regulations that require reductions in nitrogen oxide levels 
non regulated expenditures declined by million and the comparison reflects costs incurred in associated with four synfuel facilities that became fully operational 
during  the investing activity cash flow comparison improved by billion and was impacted by the cash portion of the mcn energy acquisition in the improvement was also due to lower non regulated capital expenditures  partially offset by reduced proceeds from the sale of assets 
outlook our strategic direction anticipates base level capital investments and expenditures for existing businesses in ranging from million to billion 
our utilities plan to spend higher amounts of capital  but actual spending levels will be matched to available cash flows 
until our two rate cases are resolved  we will hold utility capital spending at levels 
capital spending for general corporate purposes will increase in primarily as a result of our dte initiative  as subsequently discussed 
this project will require capital investments in and for new computer systems 
non regulated capital spending will approximate million to million annually for the next several years 
capital spending for growth of existing or new businesses will be constrained in due to the pending rate cases  electric customer choice issues and rating agency concerns about these businesses 
accordingly  we are seeking to grow the business by making small investments in areas like coal bed methane and waste coal recovery 
utilizing this approach allows us to determine quarterly our spending levels  which will be based on capital and credit constraints 
longer term  once the electric choice issues are resolved and utility rate increases are fully phased in  we anticipate capital availability to return to historical levels 
after the utilities return to financial health  we will continue to pursue opportunities to grow our businesses in a disciplined fashion 
if we can find opportunities that meet our strategy and financial and risk criteria we will look to make investments 
if we have the available cash flow and can t find value creating investments  we intend to return that capital to shareholders and pay down debt 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources  both internal and external  to balance anticipated capital requirements 
financing activities we continually evaluate our leverage targets to ensure that they are consistent with our objective to have a strong investment grade debt rating 
since our merger with mcn energy in  we have been successful in reducing our leverage 
given the present environment in our industry  the increase in regulatory assets  and the nature of the electric customer choice program and other uncertainties  we may need to further lower our leverage in the future 
our strategy is to have a targeted debt portfolio blend as to fixed and variable interest rates and maturity 
we have completed a number of refinancings over the past several years with the effect of extending the average maturity of our long term debt 
the extension of the average maturity was accomplished at interest rates which have lowered our debt costs 
variable rate debt is principally in the form of outstanding commercial paper 
additionally  we have interest rate derivatives that effectively converts fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
variable rate debt represents approximately of our total debt outstanding as of december  
table of contents our net cash related to financing activities decreased billion in and decreased billion in the change was due to higher redemptions of long term debt and lower proceeds from issuances of new debt and common stock 
in  proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock were used for the redemption of higher cost debt and to reduce short term borrowings 
the issuance of billion of securitization bonds and the issuance of billion of long term debt to finance the acquisition of mcn energy impacts the comparison between and in  proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds and other detroit edison and michcon debt were used to repay higher priced debt and repurchase our common stock 
details of financing activities follows note michcon issued million of senior notes due in march the proceeds were used for debt redemption and general corporate purposes 
dte energy issued million of senior notes due in april in conjunction with this issuance  dte energy exchanged million principal amount of existing debt due april the proceeds were used for debt redemptions and general corporate purposes 
dte energy redeemed million principal amount of remarketed notes due in detroit edison issued million of tax exempt bonds due in the proceeds were used to redeem million of tax exempt bonds due outlook our goal is to maintain a healthy balance sheet 
we intend on maintaining a high investment grade credit rating and maintaining leverage in the to range excluding certain debt  principally securitization debt 
we expect to contribute million of dte energy common stock to our pension plan in the first quarter of this contribution will modestly improve our leverage 
additionally  we expect to continue the practice of issuing new dte energy shares for our dividend reinvestment plan 
we believe this is a cost effective means of raising new equity 
debt maturing in totals approximately million and we called million of trust preferred linked securities in late in addition  there are outstanding debt instruments that are likely to be economic to redeem and refund with new debt in the company expects to continue to take advantage of low historical long term interest rates and issue new securities with a longer life than the securities maturing or called 
as of december   dte energy  detroit edison and michcon have effective shelf registrations with the sec that allow for the issuance of up to an additional billion of debt and million of equity securities 
we have authorization from the dte energy board to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
no shares have been repurchased under this authorization since early future repurchases are not presently contemplated and will depend upon future market conditions and the company s financial condition 
in october  dte energy  detroit edison and michcon entered into separate revolving credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling billion 
these facilities support our use of letters of credit and the issuance of commercial paper 
borrowing available under these revolving credit facilities totaled billion as of december  our revolving credit facilities contain customary covenants  including the requirement to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of not more than 
to  and an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to interest ratio of no less than to as of december   our debt to total capitalization ratio as computed under the terms of the agreement was

additionally  detroit edison has a million short term financing agreement secured by customer accounts receivable of which million was outstanding as of december  the agreement contains certain covenants related to the delinquency of accounts receivable 
detroit edison is currently in compliance with these covenants

an unfavorable change in our rating could restrict our ability to access capital markets at attractive rates and increase our borrowing costs 
we have issued guarantees for the benefit of various non regulated subsidiaries 
in the event that our credit rating is downgraded two levels and would therefore be below investment grade  certain of these guarantees would require us to post cash or letters of credit valued at approximately million at december  additionally  our trading business could be required to cease operations and our access to the short term commercial paper market would be restricted or eliminated 
while we currently do not anticipate such a downgrade  we cannot predict the outcome of current or future reviews

such estimates relate to regulation  risk management and trading activities  section tax credits  goodwill  pension and post retirement costs  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
regulation a significant portion of our business is subject to regulation 
detroit edison and michcon currently meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

all of our synthetic fuel facilities have received favorable private letter rulings from the irs with respect to their operations 
all section tax credits taken after are subject to audit by the irs  and if we fail to prevail through the administrative and legal process  there could be a significant tax liability owed for previously taken section tax credits

goodwill certain of our business units have goodwill resulting from purchase business combinations note 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired 
in order to perform these impairment tests  we must determine the reporting unit s fair value using valuation techniques  which use estimates of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
these cash flow estimates involve judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results 
to the extent estimated cash flows are revised downward  the reporting unit may be required to write down all or a portion of its goodwill which would adversely impact our earnings 
based on our goodwill impairment test  we determined that no impairment existed 
as of december   our goodwill totaled billion 
pension and postretirement costs our costs of providing pension and postretirement benefits are dependent upon a number of factors  including rates of return on plan assets  the discount rate  the rate of increase in health care costs and the amount and timing of plan sponsor contributions 
we had pension costs for qualified pension plans of million in  pension income of million in and pension costs of million in postretirement benefits costs for all plans was million in  million in and million in pension and postretirement benefits cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our plan assets of at december  in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our consultants  including their review of asset class risk and return expectations as well as inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond markets 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption utilizing active investment management of in equity markets  in fixed income markets  and invested in other assets 
because of market volatility  we periodically review our asset allocation and rebalance our portfolio when considered appropriate 
given market conditions we believe that is a reasonable long term rate of return on our plan assets 
we will continue to evaluate our actuarial assumptions  including our expected rate of return  at least annually 
we base our determination of the expected return on qualified plan assets on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic manner over a three year period 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
we have unrecognized net losses due to the recent unfavorable performance of the financial markets 
as of december   we had million of cumulative losses that remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining future pension and postretirement benefit obligations is based on a review of bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating 
table of contents agency 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  due to recent financial market performance  lower discount rates and increased health care trend rates  we estimate that our pension costs will approximate million compared to million in and our postretirement benefit costs will approximate million compared to million in we have made modifications to the pension and postretirement benefit plans to mitigate the earnings impact of higher costs 
future actual pension and postretirement benefit costs will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to plan design 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by would have increased our qualified pension costs by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by would have increased our pension costs for by approximately million 
lowering the health care cost trend assumptions by would have decreased our postretirement benefit service and interest costs for by approximately million 
the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets has been affected by declines in the financial markets in recent years 
the value of our plan assets decreased from billion at december   to billion at december  the value at december  increased to billion 
the investment performance returns and declining discount rates required us to recognize at december   an additional minimum pension liability of million  an intangible asset of million and an entry to other comprehensive loss shareholders equity of million  net of tax 
as of december   we recognized a decrease in minimum pension liability of million  a decrease in intangible assets of million and a decrease in other comprehensive loss a component of shareholders equity of million million after tax 
the additional minimum pension liability and related accounting entries will be reversed on the balance sheet in future periods if the fair value of plan assets exceeds the accumulated pension benefit obligations 
the recording of the minimum pension liability does not affect net income or cash flow 
pension and postretirement costs and pension cash funding requirements will increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the financial markets 
we made a million cash contribution to the pension plan in and a million cash contribution in we anticipate making an approximate million contribution to our pension plan in the form of dte energy common stock in the first quarter of we also contributed million to the postretirement plans in we did not contribute to the postretirement plans in  and made a million contribution in january in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act was signed into law 
this act provides for a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law 
we have not quantified the impact of the act  if any  on our plan 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends  economic conditions  age of receivables and other information 
with the implementation of a new integrated utility billing system in late  we encountered billing issues as is typical with large scale system implementations 
while we have resolved the primary billing issues  we may encounter difficulty in collecting past due receivables 
higher customer bills due to increased gas prices  the lack of adequate levels of assistance for low income customers and economic conditions have also contributed to the increase in past due receivables 
as a result of these factors  our allowance for doubtful accounts increased in and we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on reasonable estimates 
however  failure to make continued progress in collecting our past due receivables would unfavorably affect operating results and cash flow 

table of contents environmental matters protecting the environment  as well as correcting past environmental damage  continues to be a focus of state and federal regulators 
legislation and or rulemaking could further impact the electric utility industry including detroit edison 
the environmental protection agency epa and the michigan department of environmental quality have aggressive programs to clean up contaminated property 
the epa ozone transport regulations and final new air quality standards relating to ozone and particulate air pollution will continue to impact us 
detroit edison has spent approximately million through december and estimates that it will spend approximately million in and incur up to an additional billion of future capital expenditures over the next five to eight years to satisfy both existing and proposed new control requirements 
recovery of costs to be incurred through december is included in our june electric rate case 
in addition  we maintain the option to securitize these costs after the completion of our current regulatory proceedings 
the epa has initiated enforcement actions against several major electric utilities citing violations of the clean air act  asserting that older  coal fired power plants have been modified in ways that would require them to comply with the more restrictive new source provisions of the clean air act 
detroit edison received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject 
the epa has not initiated proceedings against detroit edison 
the united states district court for the southern district of ohio eastern division issued a decision in august finding ohio edison company in violation of the new source provisions of the clean air act 
if the court s decision is upheld  the electric utility industry could be required to invest substantial amounts in pollution control equipment 
during the same month  however  a district court in a different division rendered a conflicting decision on the matter 
on august   the epa released new rules  effective december   allowing repair  replacement or upgrade of production equipment without triggering source requirement controls if the cost of the parts and repairs do not exceed of the replacement value of the equipment being upgraded 
such repairs will be considered routine maintenance  however any changes in emissions would be subject to existing pollution permit limits and other state and federal programs for pollutants 
several states and environmental organizations have challenged these regulations and on december   were granted a stay until the us court of appeals us circuit hears the arguments on the case 
we cannot predict the future impact of this issue upon detroit edison 
dte energy operating system and dte during  we adopted the dte energy operating system  which is a philosophy that involves the application of tools and operating practices that have resulted in inventory reductions and improvements in technology systems  among other enhancements 
operation and maintenance expenses benefited from our company wide initiative to pursue cost efficiencies and enhance operating performance 
we expect continued cost containment efforts and process improvements 
in  we began the implementation of dte  a company wide initiative to improve existing processes and to implement new core information systems including  finance  human resources  supply chain and work management 
we expect to incrementally spend approximately million to million over the next to years to implement these new processes and systems 
we expect the benefits to outweigh this investment primarily from lower costs  faster business cycles  repeatable and optimized processes  enhanced internal controls  improvements in inventory management and reductions in system support costs
