item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
company profile we are the largest provider of checks in the united states  both in terms of revenue and number of checks produced 
we design  manufacture and distribute a comprehensive line of printed checks 
in addition to checks  we also offer checkbook covers  business forms  address labels  self inking stamps  fraud prevention services and customer retention programs 
information concerning revenue by product is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
we operate three business segments financial services  direct checks and business services 
financial services sells checks  related products and check merchandising services to more than  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies 
direct checks is the nation s leading direct to consumer check supplier  selling under the checks unlimited and designer checks brands 
through these two brands  direct checks sells personal and business checks  as well as related products  using direct response marketing and the internet 
business services sells checks  forms and related products to small businesses and home offices through financial institution referrals  business alliances and via direct mail and the internet 
all three segments operate only in the united states 
the check printing portion of the payments industry is mature 
according to our estimates  the total number of personal  business and government checks written in the united states has been in decline since the mid s as a result of alternative payment methods  such as debit cards  smart cards  electronic and other bill paying services and internet based payment services 
however  a federal reserve study reported that the check is still americans preferred method of non cash payment  accounting for approximately of all non cash payments 
our relationships with specific financial institutions are usually formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
because we do operate in a mature portion of the industry  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
this has resulted in reduced profit margins  and we expect this pricing pressure to continue 
additionally  the direct response marketing industry has been experiencing reduced consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
this is our traditional means of new customer acquisition for our direct checks segment 
we believe that the decline in consumer response rates is attributable to the decline in check usage  an overall increase in direct mail solicitations received by our target customers and the multi box promotional strategies employed by us and our competitors 
our operating results were adversely impacted by the prolonged downturn in general economic conditions 
consumer spending was down through the first half of the year  thus  fewer checks were being used 
although consumer spending rates have recently improved  there tends to be some lag time between economic conditions and their impact on our business 
additionally  the united states census bureau recently indicated that annual moving rates have declined across the country 
because a household move typically requires new checks  fewer moves translate to fewer check orders 
finally  employment levels have not yet shown improvement 
there is a correlation between employment and the ability of consumers to open checking accounts 
thus  the employment rate is a key factor for the check printing portion of the payments industry 
to offset the decline in check usage resulting from alternative payments methods and economic conditions  as well as the pricing pressure faced by our financial services segment  we have focused on improving our selling techniques within all three segments to increase revenue per unit 
we have also taken several steps to lower our cost structure 
in financial services  we have implemented the deluxeselect sm program 
this program allows us to interact directly with the customers of financial institutions and to leverage our extensive market research and knowledge of consumer behaviors and preferences 
in direct checks  we encourage consumers to place their orders by phone  where our sales associates have the opportunity to interact with the consumer 
in business services  we have partnered with our financial institution clients to increase the use of our financial institution referral program 
under this program  our financial institution clients refer their small business customers to us at the time of new account opening 
this allows us direct interaction with the small business customer 
additionally  we have established business alliances under which consumers interact directly with us when ordering checks and related products 
we have also provided extensive training to our business services sales associates as we transition that organization from a service to a selling environment 
all of these efforts have led to increased sales of premium priced licensed and specialty check designs and additional value added services such as fraud prevention and express delivery 
additionally  to combat the reduced consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements within the direct checks segment  we continually analyze our marketing approach to ensure we utilize the most effective media sources 
our financial services segment intends to target financial institution clients that understand the value we provide 
we provide high quality products  superior service  enhanced customer satisfaction and the check program management skills which lead to improved revenue and profitability for financial institutions 
we will not focus on financial institutions for which the only goal is low price 
we continue to be cost conscious so that we are able to compete as the decline in check usage and pricing pressure continue 
we plan to close three financial services check printing facilities during and also have announced other employee reductions 
we have increased efficiencies in our manufacturing and order capture areas  and we continue to closely manage spending and seek cost saving opportunities throughout the company 
even with the challenges we face  check printing continues to be a profitable business for us 
we generated strong operating cash flows of million during these cash flows have allowed us to lower our cost of capital by increasing our debt level 
during  we issued million of long term debt  and during  our total debt level increased million to million as of december  we utilized the proceeds from this debt primarily to repurchase our common shares 
during  we repurchased a total of million shares 
we have also continued to pay dividends at an annual rate of per share 
we believe that we have the financial strength to pursue acquisitions which leverage our core competencies and are accretive to earnings and cash flow  to strengthen our leading position in the markets in which we compete and to expand into closely related or adjacent products and services  all while increasing shareholder value 
special charges and credits over the past three years  we have recorded charges and credits for restructurings  asset impairments and other developments 
the significant items disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report are as follows dollars in thousands net restructuring charges    asset impairment losses  post retirement benefit curtailment gain  net pre tax charges    reversal of income tax contingencies   deferred income tax valuation allowance  net credits to provision for income taxes  the above pre tax items are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as follows dollars in thousands cost of goods sold   selling  general and administrative expense   asset impairment and net disposition losses  net pre tax charges    net restructuring charges during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance related to the planned closing of three of our financial services check printing facilities and other reductions in employees within financial services and our corporate support group 
of this amount  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of during  we also reversed million of previously established restructuring accruals 
the expertise we have developed in logistics  productivity and inventory management  as well as the decline in check usage due to the use of alternative payment methods  allows us to reduce the number of production facilities while still meeting client requirements 
by moving check production to other facilities  we expect to enhance efficiencies and more fully utilize existing assets 
the reductions in other employees are a result of our ongoing cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives  and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
the restructuring charges included estimated severance payments for employees  which are payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we anticipate that our indianapolis  indiana and pittsburgh  pennsylvania facilities will be closed by april and our campbell  california facility will be closed by july the reductions in other employees are expected to be substantially completed in the first quarter of the related severance payments are expected to be completed in the third quarter of  utilizing cash from operations 
the restructuring charges are reflected in our consolidated statement of income as cost of goods sold of million and selling  general and administrative sg a expense of million 
as a result of the facility closings and other employee reductions  we expect to realize net cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in beginning in  we anticipate net cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense 
reduced costs consist primarily of labor and facility expenses such as insurance  taxes  depreciation and maintenance 
in addition to severance payments  we anticipate spending approximately million prior to july for costs related to transferring check production to other facilities 
of this amount  approximately million will be spent on improvements to the other check printing facilities 
these improvements will be capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
after the three facilities are closed  we anticipate that our remaining facilities will be operating at average capacity of approximately 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance related primarily to manufacturing employees within the financial services segment and various functional areas within the direct checks segment 
during  we also reversed million of previously established restructuring accruals 
these reductions were the result of our ongoing cost management efforts

the reductions were completed in  with employees receiving a total of million in severance payments 
the restructuring charges are reflected in the consolidated statement of income as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million 
asset impairment losses during  we recorded asset impairment losses of million  primarily in the financial services segment 
of this amount  million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the impaired assets consisted of both manufacturing technologies and software 
we had been intending to implement the manufacturing technologies during however  having already realized many efficiencies in our manufacturing function as a result of other initiatives  including the implementation of lean manufacturing  the incremental benefits expected from these technologies no longer warranted their implementation 
the impaired software was intended to replace several of our existing systems and bring various areas of the company onto one platform 
however  based on our continuing evaluation of investment initiatives  we determined that the costs to implement the system and the timeline for implementation did not result in an adequate return on our investment 
the majority of the impaired assets had no alternative uses and could not be sold to third parties 
thus  these assets were written down to a carrying value of zero 
certain related hardware assets are expected to be sold to third parties and were written down to their fair value less costs to sell  based on bids received from third parties 
of the total asset impairment losses  million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to intangible assets 
post retirement benefit curtailment gain during the fourth quarter of  we amended our retiree health care plan to limit the number of employees eligible for benefits under the plan 
in order to receive the current level of benefits  employees must reach years of service and points total of age and years of service prior to january  employees reaching years of service and points between january  and december  are eligible for the current level of benefits  however  their premiums will not be reduced once they become eligible for medicare as is currently the case 
employees reaching years of service and points after december  must pay the full cost of coverage if they elect to participate in our health care plan 
as a result of this plan change  we recognized a curtailment gain of million during the fourth quarter of this gain is reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold of million and a reduction of sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
we anticipate that this plan change will result in a million decrease in our post retirement benefit expense 
adjustments to provision for income taxes during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
also during  we recorded a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards which expired in during the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service irs completed its review of our income tax returns for through as a result  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
certain irs rules were clarified in a manner favorable to us  and the related reserves were no longer required 
substantially offsetting these reversals in was a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards 
at december   we had capital loss carryforwards of approximately million which expired in by the fourth quarter of  the predominance of negative evidence indicated that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with a majority of the capital loss carryforwards would not be realized as certain tax planning strategies upon which we intended to rely were no longer considered to be prudent or feasible

ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we disclose ebitda because it can be used to analyze profitability between companies and industries by eliminating the effects of financing ie  interest and capital investments ie  depreciation and amortization 
we continually evaluate ebitda  as we believe that an increasing ebitda depicts increased ability to attract financing and increases the valuation of our business

partially offsetting the increase in revenue per unit was a decrease in unit volume 
over of this volume decline was due to lower financial institution conversion activity during  as bank mergers and acquisitions were down from conversion activity is driven by the need to replace checks after one financial institution merges with or acquires another

we believe that important measures of our financial strength are the ratios of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense and free cash flow to total debt 
we calculate free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of capital assets and dividends paid to shareholders 
ebit to interest expense was times for  times for and times for our committed lines of credit contain covenants requiring a minimum ebit to interest expense ratio on a four quarter trailing basis of times 
the decrease in  as compared to  was primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher interest rates and debt levels primarily due to the issuance of million of long term notes in december although this additional interest expense has caused this ratio to decrease  we believe the risk of violating our financial covenants is low as we expect solid profitability and cash flow to continue 
the increase in  as compared to  was primarily due to the improvements in operating results discussed earlier under results of operations and lower interest expense in due to lower interest rates 
the comparable ratio of net income to interest expense was times for  times for and times for free cash flow to total debt was for  for and for the decrease in  as compared to  was due to the higher level of debt outstanding as of december   which was utilized to fund share repurchases  as well as the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed earlier 
these decreases were partially offset by the lower level of capital asset purchases in as we reduced discretionary spending and the lower level of dividends paid due to fewer shares outstanding 
the decrease in  as compared to  was due to the higher debt level as of december  resulting from borrowings to implement our financial strategy 
this impact was partially offset by increased earnings and the lower amount of dividends paid in based on fewer shares outstanding 
the comparable ratio of net cash provided by operating activities to total debt was for  for and for as of december   we had million of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million was short term debt and the remainder was long term debt 
our short term debt consisted of commercial paper outstanding under a million commercial paper program 
our commercial paper program was increased to million from million during and carries a credit rating of a p if for any reason we were unable to access the commercial paper markets  we would rely on our committed lines ebit is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
by excluding interest and income taxes  this measure of profitability can indicate whether a company s earnings are adequate to pay its debts 
we monitor this measure on an ongoing basis  as we believe it illustrates our operating performance without regard to financing methods  capital structure or income taxes 
we do not consider ebit to be a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
instead  we believe that ebit is a useful performance measure which should be considered in addition to those measures reported in accordance with gaap 
the measure of ebit to interest expense illustrates how many times the current year s ebit covers the current year s interest expense 
our committed lines of credit contain covenants requiring a minimum ebit to interest expense ratio 
ebit is derived from net income as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net income    provision for income taxes    interest expense  net    ebit    free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance under gaap 
we monitor free cash flow on an ongoing basis  as it measures the amount of cash generated from our operating performance after investment initiatives and the payment of dividends 
it represents the amount of cash available for interest payments  debt service  general corporate purposes and strategic initiatives 
we do not consider free cash flow to be a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
instead  we believe that free cash flow is a useful liquidity measure which should be considered in addition to those measures reported in accordance with gaap 
the measure of free cash flow to total debt is a liquidity measure which illustrates to what degree our free cash flow covers our existing debt 
free cash flow is derived from net cash provided by operating activities as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   purchases of capital assets    cash dividends paid to shareholders    free cash flow    of credit for liquidity 
the average amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   million was outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 
the average amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   no commercial paper was outstanding 
we have committed lines of credit for million which primarily support our commercial paper program 
to the extent not needed to support outstanding commercial paper  we may borrow funds under these lines of credit 
we have a day line of credit for million which expires in august and carries a commitment fee of seven basis points 
we also have a million line of credit which expires in august and carries a commitment fee of nine basis points 
the credit agreements governing these lines of credit contain customary covenants regarding the ratio of ebit to interest expense and levels of subsidiary indebtedness 
we believe the risk of violating our financial covenants is low as we expect solid profitability and cash flow to continue 
no amounts were drawn on these lines of credit during or as of december   million was available under these lines of credit for borrowing or for support of additional commercial paper 
we also have an uncommitted bank line of credit for million available at variable interest rates 
no amounts were drawn on this line of credit during or  and no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit as of december  absent certain defined events of default under our committed credit facilities  there are no significant contractual restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends 
our long term debt consists of million of long term notes  net of discount  million of medium term notes and million of capital lease obligations 
in august  our board of directors approved a financial strategy intended to reduce our cost of capital and as a result  increase leverage 
this strategy involves increasing our total debt level up to a targeted maximum of million  using the additional debt in part to repurchase shares or pursue suitable acquisitions 
our board also approved a million share repurchase program in august as part of this financial strategy 
as a result of this announcement  our long term credit rating was downgraded to a from a by standard and poor s and was downgraded to a from a by moody s investors service 
we still maintain a strong investment grade credit rating and expect no impact on our ability to borrow 
our credit facilities do not have covenants or events of default tied to maintaining our credit rating 
in connection with our financial strategy  in december  we issued million of senior  unsecured notes which mature in december and have a coupon rate of 
the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including funding share repurchases  capital asset purchases and working capital 
on april   we filed a form s shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration allows for the issuance of debt securities  from time to time  up to an aggregate of million 
the shelf registration statement became effective on july  in september  we established a million medium term note program under this shelf registration 
as of december  we had issued million of medium term notes 
of these notes  million mature in september and have a coupon rate of and million mature in november and have an interest rate equal to the month london interbank offered rate libor plus 
this interest rate is reset on a quarterly basis 
in september  we completed all repurchases under the million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in august in august  the board authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased million shares under the august authorization 
stock repurchase activities are subject to certain pricing restrictions  stock market forces  management discretion and various regulatory requirements 
as a result  we cannot predict the timing or amount of shares that we may repurchase under the current authorization 
changes in financial condition other non current assets increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase related to contract acquisition payments of million made to financial institution clients during  as well as contract acquisition costs accrued as of december  contract acquisition costs are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
partially offsetting these increases was amortization of contract acquisition costs of million in the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  contributing to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or obtain clients 
beginning in  as competitive pressure intensified  both the number of financial institution clients requiring contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments increased 
although we anticipate that we will continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid is dependent on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  the actions of our competitors  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
we do anticipate that these payments will continue to be a significant use of cash 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
the impact of these costs is the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made as opposed to providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
based on the contract acquisition costs balance as of december   estimated amortization for each of the next five years ending december is as follows dollars in thousands short term debt increased to million as of december  from zero as of december  long term debt increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  these increases were due to the issuance of commercial paper and medium term notes during  as we continued to implement the financial strategy discussed earlier 
shareholders deficit equity decreased million to a deficit of million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease was due to the required accounting treatment for share repurchases 
in august  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
these repurchases were completed in september at a cost of million 
in august  the board authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of common stock 
through december   million of these additional shares had been repurchased at a cost of million 
given the strength of our financial position  as reflected in our cash flow and coverage ratios such as ebit to interest expense and free cash flow to total debt  we do not expect our shareholders deficit position to result in any adverse reaction from rating agencies or others that would negatively affect our liquidity or financial condition 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt and related interest     commercial paper   capital lease obligation and related interest      operating lease obligations    purchase obligations     other long term liabilities     total      long term debt consists of the million of senior  unsecured notes and million of medium term notes discussed earlier under liquidity  capital resources and financial condition 
the amounts presented in the table above for long term debt include both principal and interest payments  using the current interest rate of for the million variable rate notes 
we currently have commitments under both operating and capital leases 
our capital lease obligation bears interest at a rate of and is due through we have also entered into operating leases on certain facilities and equipment 
purchase obligations include amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for information technology services  including software development and support services  and personal computer  telecommunications  network server and help desk services 
additionally  purchase obligations include amounts due under royalty agreements and direct checks direct mail advertising agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor 
as such  these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here 
certain of the contracts with third party service providers allow for early termination upon the payment of specified penalties 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would incur penalties of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for workers compensation  deferred officers compensation and environmental liabilities 
accruals for environmental matters were million as of december  during  we purchased an environmental insurance policy which covers pre existing conditions from third party claims and cost overruns for years at owned  leased and divested sites  as well as any new conditions discovered at currently owned or leased sites for ten years 
as a result  we expect to receive reimbursements from the insurance company for environmental remediation costs we incur 
the related receivables from the insurance company are reflected in other current assets and other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to our environmental liabilities 
of the million reported as long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the payments shown in the table above 
a portion of the excluded amount consists of amounts due under our deferred officers compensation plan 
under this plan  employees begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
additionally  the excluded amount includes items which will not be paid in cash  such as a deferred gain resulting from a sale leaseback transaction with an unaffiliated third party 
total contractual obligations do not include amounts which will be due under our defined contribution pension plan or our k  profit sharing or retiree health care plans 
the amounts payable under our defined contribution pension plan and our k plan are dependent on the number of employees providing services throughout the year  their wage rates and in the case of the k plan  whether employees elect to participate in the plan 
the amounts payable under our profit sharing plans are dependent on the financial performance of the company 
benefits paid under our retiree health care plan are dependent on the level of medical costs incurred by plan participants 
additionally  we have contributed funds to a trust for the purpose of funding our retiree health care plan 
trust assets can be utilized only to pay medical costs of plan participants 
thus  we have the option of paying retiree medical costs from the trust or from the general assets of the company 
total contractual obligations also do not include income tax payments which will be remitted on our earnings or contributions which may be made to our veba trust 
contingent commitments off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the spin off of our former efunds segment on december   we agreed to indemnify efunds for future losses arising from any litigation based on the conduct of efunds electronic benefits transfer and medical eligibility verification business prior to efunds initial public offering in june  and from certain future losses on identified loss contracts in excess of efunds accrual for contract losses as of april  the maximum contractual amount of litigation and contract losses for which we would indemnify efunds is million 
this agreement remains in effect until one year after the termination of the identified loss contracts or until all disputes have been settled 
all identified loss contracts are scheduled to expire by through december   no amounts have been paid or claimed under this agreement 
this obligation is not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  as it is not probable that any payment will occur 
it has not been our practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there have historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications  and we do not expect any material adverse claims in the future 
we have established a formal contract review process to assist in identifying significant indemnification clauses 
we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  or on our access to  or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we have not established any special purpose entities 
related party transactions we have entered into no significant related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long lived assets  contract acquisition costs  deferred advertising costs  post retirement benefits and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
there were no significant changes to our accounting policies during additionally  we did not adopt any new accounting policies  including those required by newly issued accounting standards  which would materially impact our results of operations or their presentation in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
application of critical accounting policies long lived assets as of december   we had net property  plant and equipment of million and net intangible assets of million 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections and other considerations  including impairment losses  estimated useful lives  depreciation and amortization methods and salvage values 
we must evaluate the recoverability of property  plant  equipment and identifiable intangibles not held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
we recorded asset impairment losses of million in related to both manufacturing technologies and software 
we had been intending to implement the manufacturing technologies during however  having already realized many efficiencies in our manufacturing function as a result of other initiatives  including the implementation of lean manufacturing  the incremental benefits expected from these technologies no longer warranted their implementation 
the impaired software was intended to replace several of our existing systems and bring various areas of the company onto one platform 
however  based on our continuing evaluation of investment initiatives  we determined that the costs to implement the system and the timeline for implementation did not result in an adequate return on our investment 
the majority of the impaired assets had no alternative uses and could not be sold to third parties 
thus  these assets were written down to a carrying value of zero 
certain related hardware assets are expected to be sold to third parties and were written down to their fair value less costs to sell  based on bids received from third parties 
of the total asset impairment losses  million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to intangible assets 
no significant asset impairment losses were recorded during or our business segments record depreciation and amortization expense in cost of goods sold or sg a expense based on how the assets are used 
the depreciation and amortization methods and lives applied to our long lived assets are intended to allocate the cost of these assets over their estimated useful lives and in proportion to the benefits received from their use 
we continually evaluate the useful lives and depreciation and amortization methods used 
as circumstances change or the manner in which we utilize a particular asset changes  adjustments to these estimates may be necessary 
any change in estimate is reflected on a prospective basis and thus  does not impact the results of operations for periods prior to the change 
during  we revised the estimated useful lives for certain of our e commerce intangible assets 
these changes in estimate resulted in increased amortization expense of million in no significant changes in depreciation or amortization estimates were made during or during the first quarter of  we revised the estimated useful lives for certain of our software assets  as we anticipate that the assets will be replaced sooner than originally assumed 
this change in accounting estimate is expected to result in increased amortization expense of approximately million in  primarily in the last three quarters of the year 
even with this change in accounting estimate  we expect total depreciation and amortization expense in to be comparable to contract acquisition costs as of december   we had net capitalized contract acquisition costs of million 
we record contract acquisition costs when we sign or renew contracts with our financial institution clients 
these costs consist of cash payments or accruals related to amounts paid or owed to financial institution clients by our financial services segment 
contract acquisition costs are generally recorded as reductions of revenue on the straight line basis over the related contract term 
currently  these amounts are being amortized over periods ranging from two to seven years  with a weighted average life of years as of december  whenever events or changes occur that impact the related contract  including significant declines in the anticipated profitability  we evaluate the carrying value of the contract acquisition costs to determine if impairment has occurred 
as of december  and  contract acquisition costs consisted of balances relating to numerous financial institutions 
should a financial institution cancel a contract prior to the agreement s termination date  or should the volume of orders realized through a financial institution fall below contractually specified minimums  we generally have a contractual right to a refund of the remaining unamortized contract acquisition costs 
deferred advertising costs as of december   we had deferred advertising costs of million 
these costs include materials  printing  labor and postage costs related primarily to direct response advertising programs of our direct checks segment 
these costs are amortized as sg a expense over periods not exceeding months that correspond to the estimated revenue streams of the individual advertisements 
the actual revenue streams are analyzed at least annually to monitor the propriety of the amortization periods 
judgment is required in estimating the future revenue streams  as check re orders can span an extended period of time 
significant changes in the actual revenue streams would require the amortization periods to be modified  thus impacting our results of operations during the period in which the change occurred and in subsequent periods 
under our current amortization schedule  approximately of the costs of an individual advertisement are expensed within six months of the advertisement 
during the first quarter of  we reviewed our various marketing programs and the related revenues generated from these programs 
as a result of this review  we modified the estimated revenue streams over which our deferred advertising costs are amortized 
we shortened the amortization periods from an average of months to a maximum of months  and we revised our pattern of amortization to reflect the fact that due to our promotional strategies  a larger proportion of revenues are generated from reorders than from initial orders 
additionally  the decline in check usage and our promotional strategies for multi box orders have resulted in a lengthening of the check reorder cycle 
the net impact of these changes in accounting estimates resulted in a decrease in sg a expense of approximately million during however  overall advertising expense for direct checks in was comparable to due to the timing and amount of advertising spend 
during and  no material revisions were made to the amortization of deferred advertising costs 
post retirement benefits our net post retirement benefit expense was million in  million in and million in our business segments record post retirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold or sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our post retirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our post retirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
in measuring the net post retirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
in measuring the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be and our ultimate health care inflation rate for and beyond was assumed to be 
a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual post retirement benefit expense by million 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
unrecognized gains and losses are reflected in post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of employees expected to receive benefits under the plan  which is currently nine years 
as of december   our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million 
of this amount  million resulted from changes in the discount rate assumption 
during each of the last three years we have lowered our discount rate assumption due to decreases in interest rates 
as of december   million of the unrecognized net actuarial loss resulted from differences between our expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the actual return on plan assets 
since this assumption takes a long term view of investment returns  there may be differences between the expected rate of return and the actual rate of return on plan assets in the short term 
also as of december   million of the unrecognized net actuarial loss resulted from changes in our assumed health care cost trend rate 
in recent years we have increased our heath care cost trend rate assumption to reflect the current trend of increasing medical costs 
the remainder of the net actuarial loss amount primarily related to differences between our assumed medical costs and actual experience and changes in the employee population 
during the fourth quarter of  we amended our retiree health care plan to limit the number of employees eligible for benefits under the plan 
this change was discussed earlier under special charges and credits and resulted in a curtailment gain of million in this gain is reflected as a reduction of cost of goods sold of million and a reduction of sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
we anticipate that this plan change will result in a million decrease in our post retirement benefit expense 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as capital assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
additionally  we have established reserves for income tax contingencies 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by tax authorities 
we believe that our current income tax reserves are adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
a prior year federal audit period was closed due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  and we reached agreements with two states to favorably settle proposed income tax audit assessments 
as a result  the related reserves were no longer required 
during  we reversed million of previously established income tax reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  the irs completed its review of our income tax returns for through certain irs rules were clarified in a manner favorable to us  and the related reserves were no longer required 
substantially offsetting these reversals in was a million charge for a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset for capital loss carryforwards which expired in by the fourth quarter of  the predominance of negative evidence indicated that it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with a majority of the capital loss carryforwards would not be realized as certain tax planning strategies upon which we intended to rely were no longer considered to be prudent or feasible 
other matters in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures required in financial statements concerning obligations under certain guarantees 
it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of liabilities by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of this interpretation in the recognition provisions of the interpretation are applicable only to guarantees issued or modified after december  adoption of this interpretation has had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity and addresses when the assets  liabilities and results of operations of such entities must be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
this interpretation was effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and for variable interest entities in which we obtain an interest after that date 
for interests in variable interest entities that were acquired prior to january   we adopted the provisions of this interpretation on july  adoption of this statement did not result in the consolidation or disclosure of any variable interest entities in which we maintain an interest 
we do not absorb the majority of the losses or residual returns of the variable interest entities in which we maintain an interest and these interests are not significant 
in december  the fasb issued a revised fin no 
which clarifies certain aspects of the accounting for variable interest entities 
the revision of fin no 
had no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this statement revises the disclosures required for pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
we have incorporated the new disclosure requirements into the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this fsp outlines the appropriate accounting treatment for the effects of the new medicare law  as well as the required financial statement disclosures 
the new law introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare  as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare plan 
our retiree medical plans do provide prescription drug coverage 
however  as permitted by fsp no 
fas  we have elected to defer recognition of the impacts of the new law on the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation and net periodic post retirement benefit expense presented in our consolidated financial statements 
specific authoritative accounting guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided for in the act is pending 
that guidance  when issued  could require us to change previously reported information 
beginning january   medicare s prescription drug plan will be the primary plan for our qualified retirees when they become age and are eligible for medicare 
thus  we do anticipate a decrease in the amount of prescription drug benefits we will pay beginning in on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and will report this change in accounting principle using the modified prospective method described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
beginning in  our results of operations will reflect compensation expense for new stock options granted under our stock incentive plan  for the unvested portion of previous stock options granted and for shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in early  we completed a comprehensive review of our long term incentive compensation plan  including our stock based compensation practices 
as a result  we anticipate that we will issue fewer stock options in however  we anticipate providing new forms of long term incentive compensation  such as a performance share plan 
we anticipate that the impact of all stock based compensation on our results of operations will approximate the impact shown in the pro forma results of operations presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
outlook we anticipate that revenue in will be down slightly from we expect a decrease in unit volume as compared to due to the decline in check usage  continued competitive pricing pressure within financial services and lower consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements and lengthening reorder cycles for our direct checks segment 
however  we expect business services to continue benefiting from both its business referral program and its business alliances 
under the business referral program  financial institution clients refer their small business customers to us at the time of new account opening 
we anticipate that the expected decline in unit volume will be partially offset by steps we are taking to increase revenue per unit  such as financial services deluxeselect program and improved selling techniques within direct checks and business services 
we also anticipate that new non check products will also generate some revenue growth 
as discussed earlier under other matters  we will begin recording expense for all stock based compensation awards in we anticipate that the impact of stock based compensation expense will approximate the impact shown in the pro forma results of operations presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in part ii of this report 
excluding the impact of stock based compensation  we anticipate that operating income will be flat in as compared to as discussed earlier under special charges and credits  we expect to realize approximately million of cost savings from the closing of three financial services check printing facilities and other employee reductions 
we also intend to seek other cost saving opportunities throughout the company 
we anticipate that these savings will be offset to a large extent by the pricing pressure facing financial services and the decline in check usage 
we expect interest expense to be higher in due to higher debt levels and interest rates as we continue to implement our financial strategy 
we expect diluted earnings per share to be between and for the first quarter of and approximately for the full year  excluding the impact of additional share repurchases subsequent to december operating cash flow in is expected to be higher than due primarily to favorable changes in accounts payable and lower performance based employee compensation payouts 
performance based employee compensation payouts made in related to our results of operations and were lower than the payouts made in based on our results of operations 
we currently have no plans to change our dividend payout level and anticipate continuing share repurchases under our current authorization 
through december   we had purchased million shares under our current million share authorization 
shareholders equity will continue to be negative due to the required accounting treatment for share repurchases 
given the strength of our financial position as reflected in our cash flow and coverage ratios such as ebit to interest expense and free cash flow to total debt  we do not expect our shareholders deficit position to result in any adverse reaction from rating agencies or others that would negatively affect our liquidity or financial condition 
although we do anticipate that our ratio of ebit to interest expense will continue to decline in due to the increase in interest expense resulting from higher overall debt levels and higher interest rates on commercial paper  we believe the risk of violating our financial covenants is low as we expect solid profitability and cash flow to continue 
we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of capital assets during approximately million is projected to be devoted to maintaining our business  with the remainder targeted for strategic initiatives 
we continue to implement initiatives throughout the company that are directly related to our growth strategy 
our growth strategy is to leverage our core competencies of personalization  direct marketing and e commerce 
we intend to add services and expand product offerings  as well as use selling strategies that maximize revenue and profit contribution per customer 
for example  financial services recently launched a new line of personal check products and accessories for the customers of its financial institution clients 
this new line includes new check designs  address labels  stationery  personalized post it notes and mouse pads 
another new product is our gift check package  which is targeted toward those who give gifts in the form of checks 
new products being offered by direct checks include address labels  business cards  stationery  calendars and a new identity theft protection service 
we will also continue to focus on value and service 
we are committed to focusing on financial institutions who value high quality  superior service and the best experience for their customers 
we believe this approach will allow us to retain business and also attract new clients who want to maximize their check programs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
