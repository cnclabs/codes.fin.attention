item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss of  was due to increased sales revenues  which partially offset increases in manufacturing expenses  research and development  and other operating expenses 
the year over year sales increase was primarily due to the introduction of new products  such as the otc loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate hour extended release tablets and flavoxate hydrochloride mg tablets  and higher sales of a number of existing products 
during  we continued to ramp up production for new product introduction by purchasing additional equipment  and recruiting and training additional personnel 
we also continued the investment in research and development 
during  we filed eight applications with the fda and received nine anda approvals 
we expect increased revenues in  primarily due to new product introductions  contingent upon fda approval of our andas and positive resolution of patent litigations 
we also expect that our investment in research and development area will continue to increase 
during  our general and administrative expenses are expected to increase  primarily due to higher professional fees and insurance premiums  and additional personnel 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to returns  rebates and chargebacks  inventory reserves  impaired assets and goodwill 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
the policies require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition are as follows the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab issued by the sec in december we recognize revenue from the sale of products when the shipment of products is received and accepted by the customer 
provisions for estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded 

in december  the staff accounting bulletin sab was issued by the sec 
this bulletin revises and clarifies portions of topic of the staff accounting bulletin to be consistent with current accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
supplemented sab for accounting for multiple element arrangements 
the company has entered into several strategic alliances that involve the delivery of multiple products and services over an extended period of time 
in multiple element arrangements  the company must determine whether any or all of the elements of the arrangement can be separated from one another 
if separation is possible  revenue is recognized for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria for the specific deliverable is achieved 
if separation is not possible  revenue recognition is required to be spread over an extended period 
under eitf no 
 in an arrangement with multiple elements  the delivered item should be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement included a general right of return  or whether delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable 
the company reviews all of the terms of its strategic alliances and follows the guidance from eitf no 
for multiple element arrangements 
our critical accounting policy related to returns reserve is as follows the sales return reserve is calculated using an historical lag period that is  the time between when the product is sold and when it is ultimately returned as determined from the company s system generated lag period report and return rates  adjusted by estimates of the future return rates based on various assumptions which may include changes to internal policies and procedures  changes in business practices and commercial terms with customers  competitive position of each product  amount of inventory in the pipeline  the introduction of new products  and changes in market sales information 
our returned goods policy requires prior authorization for the return  with corresponding credits being issued at the original invoice prices  less amounts previously granted to the customer for rebates and chargebacks 
products eligible for return must be expired and returned within one year following the expiration date of the product 
prior to  we required returns of products within six months of expiration date 
because of the lengths of the lag period and volatility that may occur from quarter to quarter  we are currently using a rolling month calculation to estimate our product return rate 
in addition to the rolling month calculation  we review the level of pipeline inventory at major wholesalers to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of future returns 
although the pipeline inventory information may not always be accurate or timely  it represents another data point in estimating the sales returns reserve 
if we believe that a wholesaler may have too much inventory on hand  a discussion with the wholesaler takes place and an action plan is developed to reduce inventory levels related to a particular product including  but not limited to  suspending new orders and redirecting the inventory to other distribution centers 
further  in  we have developed an order flagging mechanism based on historical purchases by individual customers 
this new process allows the company to evaluate any customer orders for quantities higher than historical purchases 
the company believes that its estimated returns reserves were adequate at each balance sheet date since they were formed based on the information that was known and available  which were supported by the company s historical experience when similar events occurred in the past  and management s overall knowledge of and experience in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
in estimating its returns reserve  the company looks to returns after the balance sheet date but prior to filing its financial statements to ensure that any unusual trends are considered 
at december  and  our returns reserve was million and million  respectively 
our critical accounting policy related to rebates and chargebacks is as follows the sales rebates are calculated at the point of sale  based on pre existing written customer agreements by product  and accrued on a monthly basis 
typically  these rebates are for a fixed percentage  as agreed to by the company and the customer in writing  multiplied by the dollar volume purchased 
the vast majority of chargebacks are also calculated at the point of sale as the difference between the list price and contract price by product with the wholesalers and accrued on a monthly basis 
therefore  for these chargebacks  the amount is fixed and determinable at the point of sale 
additionally  a relatively small percentage of chargebacks are estimated at the point of sale to the wholesaler as the difference between the wholesalers contract price and the company s contract price with retail pharmacies or buying groups 
at december  and  our reserves for rebates were million and million  respectively  and at december  and  our reserves for chargebacks were million and million  respectively 
the company believes it is important for the users of its financial statements to understand the key components  which reduce gross sales to net sales 
our critical accounting policy related to inventory is as follows inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a standard cost method  which assumes a first in  first out fifo flow of goods 
standard costs are revised annually  and significant variances between actual costs and standard costs are apportioned to inventory and cost of goods sold based upon inventory turnover 
historically  impax considered product costs as inventory once the company received fda approval to market its anda related products 
during  the company evaluated the risk of building commercial quantities as inventories of certain products that have not received fda approval 
for the first time  the company decided to build and capitalize inventories in commercial quantities prior to receiving fda approval 
the company  as do most companies in the generic pharmaceutical industry  may build inventories of certain anda related products that have not yet received fda approval and or satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation  when it believes that such action is appropriate to increase its commercial opportunity 
costs include materials  labor  quality control  and production overhead 
inventory is adjusted for short dated  unmarketed inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our critical accounting policy related to shelf stock reserve is as follows a reserve is estimated at the point of sale for certain products for which it is probable that shelf stock credits to customers for inventory remaining on their shelves following a decrease in the market price of these products will be granted 
when estimating this reserve  we consider the competitive products  the estimated decline in market prices  and the amount of inventory in the pipeline 
at december  and  the shelf stock reserve was  and  respectively 
our critical accounting policy related to impaired assets is as follows the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including definite lived intangible assets  on an annual basis  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner 
as the company s assumptions related to assets to be held and used are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
our critical accounting policy related to goodwill is as follows prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 effective january   no impairment was noted 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performs the annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level  which the company has determined to be consistent with its business segment  that is  the entire company 
effective january   we evaluated the recoverability and measured the possible impairment of our goodwill under sfas the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
our estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company  as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the generic pharmaceutical industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  we compare our estimate of fair value for the company to the book value of our consolidated net assets 
if the book value of our net assets is greater than our estimate of fair value  we would then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount of the excess 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a review of our business to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of the company and its goodwill 
if such events or changes in circumstances were deemed to have occurred  we would consult with one or more valuation specialists in estimating the impact on our estimate of fair value 
we believe the estimation methods are reasonable and reflective of common valuation practices 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were noted during the years ended december  and at december  and  the company had recorded goodwill of approximately million 
general impax laboratories  inc was formed through a business combination on december   between impax pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held drug delivery company  and global pharmaceutical corporation  a generic pharmaceutical company 
impax pharmaceuticals  inc merged with and into global  with impax pharmaceuticals  inc stockholders receiving shares of global common stock for each share of impax pharmaceuticals  inc at the conclusion of the merger  impax pharmaceuticals  inc stockholders held over of the combined company

we had an accumulated deficit of  at december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the net revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the year over year increase was primarily due to the introduction of otc loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate hour extended release tablets  and flavoxate hydrochloride mg tablets during  and higher sales  of minocycline hydrochloride mg  mg  and mg capsules  fludrocortisone acetate tablets mg  and the lipram product family

under the strategic alliance agreement with teva previously described in part i  item  if impax received tentative or final approval for any of three products of the twelve covered by this agreement  the accrued interest on the million refundable deposit would be forgiven and no future interest would accrue 
during  we met this condition  resulting in the reversal of the accrued interest in the fourth quarter of net loss the net loss for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss of  was primarily due to increased sales revenues  which partially offset increases in manufacturing expenses  research and development  and operating expenses

the revolving loan is collateralized by eligible accounts receivable and inventory  subject to sublimits and other terms  and the term loan is collateralized by machinery and equipment  with a month amortization 
in addition  a million restricted cash account was established as collateral for this credit facility to be reduced based on meeting certain cumulative positive cash flow targets 
the interest rates for the revolving loans are prime rate plus  or eurodollar rate plus  at our option  based on excess availability 
the term loan has an interest rate of prime rate plus  or eurodollar rate plus  at our option 
as of december   we borrowed approximately  against the revolving credit line and  against the term loan 
the borrowing availability under the revolving credit line changes daily based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the revolving credit facility and the term loan agreement have two financial covenants one related to adjusted excess availability  and the other one related to capital expenditures limits

we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly research and development  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following risk factors  as well as the other information included in this k report  in deciding whether to invest in our common stock 
this k report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this risk factors section  and elsewhere in this report 
risks related to our business we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating losses and negative cash flow from operations and our future profitability is uncertain 
we do not know whether or when our business will ever be profitable or generate positive cash flow  and our ability to become profitable or obtain positive cash flow is uncertain 
we have not generated significant revenues to date and have experienced operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was  and we had outstanding indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of  including  due teva pharmaceuticals curacao  nv  a subsidiary of teva pharmaceutical industries  ltd to remain operational  we must  among other things o continue to obtain sufficient capital to fund our operations  o obtain from the fda approval for our products  o prevail in patent infringement litigation in which we are involved  o successfully launch our new products  and o comply with the many complex governmental regulations that deal with virtually every aspect of our business activities 
we may never become profitable or generate positive cash flow from operations 
we currently have a limited number of commercialized products  and these products generate limited revenues and are expected to have declining revenues over their product lives 
we currently market thirty one generic pharmaceuticals which represent dosage variations of thirteen different pharmaceutical compounds 
our revenues from these products for the months ended december  were approximately million 
we do not anticipate further revenue growth from these products  rather  we anticipate that revenues from these products will decline over time 
as a result  our future prospects are dependent on our ability to successfully introduce new products 
as of march   we had nineteen applications pending at the fda for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals 
the fda and the regulatory authorities may not approve our products submitted to them or our other products under development 
additionally  we may not successfully complete our development efforts 
even if the fda approves our products  we may not be able to market our products if we do not prevail in the patent infringement litigation in which we are involved 
our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to develop  receive fda approval for  and market new pharmaceutical products 
our efforts may not result in required fda approval of our new drug products 
we are required to obtain fda approval before marketing our drug products 
the fda approval requirements are costly and time consuming 
we apply our drug delivery technologies and formulation skills to develop bioequivalent versions of selected controlled release brand name pharmaceuticals 
bioequivalent pharmaceuticals  commonly referred to as generics  are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of brand name drug products and are usually marketed under their established nonproprietary drug names rather than by a brand name 
controlled release drug delivery technologies are designed to release drug dosages at specific times and in specific locations in the body and generally provide more consistent and appropriate drug levels in the bloodstream than immediate release dosage forms 
controlled release drugs may improve drug efficacy  reduce side effects and be more patient friendly by reducing the number of times a drug must be taken 
to obtain fda approval for a new drug product  a prospective manufacturer must submit a new drug application  or nda  containing the results of clinical studies supporting the drug product s safety and efficacy 
for bioequivalent drugs  drugs that contain the same active ingredient and are of the same route of administration  dosage form  strength and indication s as drugs already approved for use in the us the reference listed drugs  a prospective manufacturer must submit an abbreviated new drug application  an anda 
an anda is similar to an nda except that an anda is only required to contain bioavailability data demonstrating that the generic formulation is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug  indicating that the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body do not show a significant difference from those of the previously approved reference listed drug product 
as a result  anda filings  compared to ndas  save development costs 
additionally  there are no user or filing fees required by the fda for andas 
our bioequivalence studies and other data may not result in fda approval to market our new drug products 
while we believe that the fda s anda procedures will apply to our bioequivalent versions of controlled release drugs  these drugs may not be suitable for  or approved as part of  these abbreviated applications 
in addition  even if our drug products are suitable for fda approval by filing an anda  the abbreviated applications are costly and time consuming to complete 
if our efforts to obtain fda approval for our current and future drug products are not successful  our business and future prospects will be substantially harmed 
approvals for our new drug products may become more difficult to obtain if the fda institutes changes to its approval requirements 
some abbreviated application procedures for controlled release drugs and other products  including those related to our anda filings  are presently the subject of petitions filed by brand name drug manufacturers  which seek changes from the fda in the approval requirements for particular drugs 
we cannot predict at this time whether the fda will make any changes to its abbreviated application requirements as a result of these petitions  or the effect that any changes may have on us 
any changes in fda regulations may make it more difficult for us to file andas or obtain approval of our andas and thus may materially harm our business and financial results 
we are subject to substantial patent litigation that could delay or prevent our commercialization of products 
patent certification requirements for controlled release drugs and for some new drugs could also result in significant delays in obtaining fda approval if the holder or holders of the brand name patents initiate infringement litigation 
we apply our processes and formulations to develop a product that will produce the brand product s physiological characteristics but not infringe upon the patents of the nda owner or other innovator 
in connection with this process  we conduct studies to establish that our product is bioequivalent to the brand product  and obtain legal advice that our products do not infringe the nda owner s or the innovator s patents and or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable 
as required by the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  known as the hatch waxman amendments  we then assemble and submit an anda to the fda for review 
if we believe that our product does not infringe a patent associated with the brand product which has been listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluation book  commonly referred to as the orange book  or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable  we are required to make a certification to this effect 
this certification is called a paragraph iv certification 
once the fda accepts our anda for filing  we must also send notice that we have filed an anda with a paragraph iv certification to the nda owner and patent holder  explaining the basis for our position that the patent s is not infringed and or is invalid or unenforceable 
the nda owner or patent holder may then initiate a legal challenge for patent infringement 
if they do so within days of their receipt of notice of our paragraph iv certification  that ensuing lawsuit will automatically prevent the fda from approving our anda until the earlier of months  expiration of the patent  or when the infringement case is decided in our favor 
in addition  delays in obtaining fda approval of abbreviated applications and some new drug applications can also result from a marketing exclusivity period and or an extension of patent terms 
thus  as the developer of bioequivalent products  we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of these products only to be subject to significant delay and the uncertain result of patent litigation before our products may be commercialized 
additionally  patent litigation is  in itself  both costly and time consuming  and the outcome of patent litigation is difficult to predict 
as of march   we had nineteen applications pending at the fda for generic versions of brand name pharmaceuticals 
patent litigation has been filed and is still outstanding in connection with seven andas that we have filed with paragraph iv certifications 
we anticipate that additional legal actions may be filed against us as we file additional applications 
patent litigation may also be brought against us in connection with nda products that we may pursue 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed by the delays in marketing our products as a result of litigation  an unfavorable outcome in any litigation  or the expense of litigation  whether or not it is successful 
if our strategic alliance with teva fails to benefit us as expected  our business will be harmed 
in june  we entered into a strategic alliance agreement with teva for controlled release generic pharmaceutical products 
the agreement granted teva exclusive us marketing rights for six of our products pending approval at the fda and six products under development at the time of the agreement 
of the six products not yet filed  we have filed andas for four with the fda 
under the agreement  we will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying teva with all of its requirements for these products and will share with teva in the gross margins from its sale of the products 
teva s exclusive marketing right for each product will run for a period of years in each country from the date of teva s first sale of that product 
unless either party provides appropriate notice  this year period will automatically be extended for two additional years 
teva elected to commercialize a competing product to one of the four products filed since june  which it developed internally 
pursuant to the agreement  we have elected to participate in the development and commercialization of teva s competing product and share in the gross margins of that product 
teva also has an option to acquire exclusive marketing rights in the rest of north america  south america  the european union  and israel for these products 
we will depend on our strategic alliance with teva to achieve market penetration and revenue generation for the products covered by the agreement 
we entered into the agreement with teva on the basis of certain expectations of the level of sales of the products which teva will achieve 
if we fail to maintain our strategic alliance with teva  or if our strategic alliance with teva fails to benefit us as expected  our revenues will not meet our expectations and our business will be harmed 
if our exclusivity transfer agreement with andrx fails to benefit us as expected  our business will be harmed 
in july  we entered into an exclusivity transfer agreement with andrx and teva in order to gain market access for generic versions of glaxosmithkline s wellbutrin sr for depression and zyban for smoking cessation 
bupropion is the active ingredient in wellbutrin sr and zyban 
the fda has granted final approval to our anda for the mg dosage form of this product 
the anda related to our mg dosage form  and the anda filed by andrx are awaiting final fda marketing approval 
we believe that the andrx anda for the mg dosage form is entitled to the marketing exclusivity period provided by law 
as a result  we cannot receive marketing approval of our products until days after andrx commences the marketing of its own product s or andrx waives its exclusivity rights 
the exclusivity transfer agreement provides a mechanism whereby andrx will determine whether it will continue pursuing the approval of its own andas for sale as the first generic versions of wellbutrin sr and zyban or will instead allow the fda to approve the andas for our products which will be marketed by teva 
if andrx allows our products to be marketed before its own  andrx is entitled to receive certain payments from us for a day period 
if andrx continues to attempt to gain the earlier approval and sale of its own products  andrx will share with us certain payments for a similar day period 
we will depend on our agreement with andrx to gain market access and revenue generation for the products covered by the agreement during the day exclusivity period 
if andrx determines to proceed with its own products  we will not be able to market our product during this exclusivity period and will only receive the royalty provided for in the agreement 
we entered into the agreement with andrx and teva on the basis of certain expectations of the level of sales of the products that will be achieved 
if we fail to maintain our collaboration with andrx and teva  or if our collaboration with andrx and teva fails to benefit us as expected  our revenues will not meet our expectations and our business will be harmed 
our stockholders may be adversely affected by strategic alliances or licensing arrangements we make with other companies 
we have entered into strategic alliances or license agreements with respect to certain products with andrx  teva  wyeth  novartis  and schering plough 
in the future  we may enter into strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with respect to other products with these or other companies 
these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on terms that ultimately may prove to be unfavorable to us  either of which could reduce the market value of our common stock 
we face intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry from both brand name and generic manufacturers  and wholesalers that could severely limit our growth and results of operations 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  research and development  marketing  and other resources than us 
we are subject to competition from numerous other entities that currently operate in the pharmaceutical industry  including companies that are engaged in the development of controlled release drug delivery technologies and products  and other manufacturers that may decide to undertake in house development of these products 
our generic products may be subject to competition from  among other products  competing generic products marketed by the patent holder

these entities often purchase generic products from a limited number of suppliers  which they then sell to end users 
among the factors considered by these entities in purchasing a generic product are price  on time delivery  a good record with the fda and relationship 
in order to obtain market share for our brand name products  we will be dependent on physicians prescribing our products to their patients 
among the factors considered by physicians in prescribing a brand name product is the quality and effectiveness of the product 
we have only limited experience in marketing our generic products and have no experience in marketing brand name products 
we  or our strategic partners  may not be able to successfully market our products 
we face risks relating to our goodwill and intangibles 
at december   our goodwill and intangibles were approximately million  or approximately of our total assets 
we may never realize the value of our goodwill and intangibles 
we will continue to evaluate  on a regular basis  whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all  or a portion  of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable  in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary 
although as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired based on our assessment performed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  any such future determination requiring the write off of a significant portion of carrying value of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our limited capital may make it difficult for us to repay indebtedness  or require us to modify our business operations and plans by spending less money on research and development programs  developing fewer products  and filing fewer drug applications with the fda 
our cash used in operations has exceeded cash generated from operations in each period since our inception 
we anticipate continuing to incur expenses substantially in excess of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately  of which  bears interest at rates ranging from to annually and the balance does not bear interest 
for the quarter and year ended december   we paid interest on our indebtedness of approximately  and  respectively 
additionally  as of december   we had an accumulated stockholders deficit of approximately  we may not be able to maintain adequate capital at any given time or from time to time in the future  which could result in less money being spent on research and development programs  fewer products being developed or at a slower pace  and fewer drug applications being filed with the fda 
if we are unable to continue to obtain financing  we may not be able to sustain our business operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million in restricted cash that serves as collateral for the million revolving credit facility and loan agreement with wachovia bank  na although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient for at least the next months of operations at our planned expenditure levels  these funds may not be sufficient and additional financing may be required 
we may seek additional financing through strategic alliances and or equity or debt markets to fund the planned capital expenditures  if required  and to fund our research and development plans  and potential revenue shortfalls due to delays in new product introductions 
the exact amount and timing of future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including continued progress with our research and development programs  expansion of these programs  the approval and launch of new products  as well as the amount of revenues generated by our existing products 
we may not be successful in obtaining additional capital in amounts sufficient to fund our operations 
additional financing also may not be available to us on terms favorable to us or our stockholders  or at all 
in the event that adequate funds are not available  our business operations and plans may be adversely affected 
generic drug makers are often most profitable when they are the first producer of a generic drug  and we do not know if we will be the first producer of any generic drug product 
the first generic drug manufacturers receiving fda approval for generic equivalents of related brand name products have often captured greater market share from the brand name product than later arriving generic manufacturers 
the development of a new generic drug product  including its formulation  testing and fda approval  generally takes approximately three or more years 
consequently  we may select drugs for development several years in advance of their anticipated entry to market and cannot know what the market or level of competition will be for that particular product if and when we begin selling the product 
in addition  by introducing generic versions of their own brand name products prior to the expiration of the patents for those drugs  brand name drug companies have attempted to prevent generic drug manufacturers from producing or capturing market share for certain products 
brand name companies have also attempted to prevent competing generic drug products from being treated as equivalent to their brand name products 
we expect efforts of this type to continue 
the congress amended provisions of the hatch waxman amendments clarifying certain issues pertaining to day exclusivity in title x of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma in november the first company to file a substantially complete anda for a reference listed brand name drug certifying that any listed patent s for that drug is not infringed and or is invalid or unenforceable obtains  in most cases  upon the fda approval  days of market exclusivity 
there may continue to be uncertainty about which generic applicant is entitled to day exclusivity  particularly as to applications filed before august  the date specified in the mma 
issues relating to day exclusivity have been subject to extensive litigation and constantly changing guidance by the fda 
in march  the fda announced that it would publish the date on which the first anda was filed which will be entitled to day exclusivity 
we believe we were the first to file with the fda on only one anda 
in addition  the laws and regulations could result in us not being able to utilize all or any portion of the day market exclusivity period on anda products we were the first to file on  depending on the timing and outcome of court decisions in patent litigation 
issues relating to day exclusivity may adversely affect our business by reducing the exclusivity period we may have for one of our products or delaying the approval of our products where another generic applicant has day exclusivity 
our inexperience in conducting clinical trials and submitting new drug applications and uncertainties inherent in clinical trials could result in delays in product development and commercialization 
prior to seeking fda approval for the commercial sale of brand name controlled release formulations under development or any drug we develop which does not qualify for the fda s abbreviated application procedures  we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use 
we have no experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials 
the process of completing clinical trials and preparing an nda may take several years and requires substantial resources 
we have never submitted an nda 
our studies and filings may not result in fda approval to market our new drug products and  if the fda grants approval  we cannot predict the timing of any approval 
additionally  a number of difficulties and uncertainties are associated with clinical trials 
the results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing 
clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and  as a result  during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested  but which nevertheless affect the clinical trial results 
moreover  our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain fda approval 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in pre clinical studies 
these failures have often resulted in decreases in the stock prices of these companies 
if any of our products under development are not shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  our business and financial results could be materially harmed 
our assumptions may not bear out as we expect 
our expectations regarding the success of our products and our business are based on assumptions which may not bear out as we expect 
in our press releases and other public documents  we have forecasted the accomplishment of objectives material to our success  such as anticipated filings with the fda and anticipated receipt of fda approvals 
for example  we have assumed that we will file with the fda at least six andas per year 
the actual timing and results of these events can vary dramatically due to factors such as the uncertainties inherent in the drug development and regulatory approval process  and delays in achieving manufacturing capacity and marketing infrastructure sufficient to commercialize our products 
we may not make regulatory submissions or receive regulatory approvals as forecasted  or we may not be able to adhere to our current schedule for product launches 
the time necessary to develop generic drugs may adversely affect if and when  and the rate at which  we receive a return on our capital 
we begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand name drug equivalent 
the development process  including drug formulation  testing  and fda review and approval  often takes three or more years 
this process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near term return 
also  because of the significant time necessary to develop a product  the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product 
if this were to occur  our potential return on our investment in developing the product  if approved for marketing by the fda  would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product 
it is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the fda to switch the brand name drug from the prescription market to the over the counter market 
if this were to occur  we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an over the counter drug  in which case product revenues could be significantly less than we anticipated 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated  and could fluctuate significantly in the future  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year 
variations may result from  among other factors o the timing of fda approvals we receive  o the timing of process validation for particular generic drug products  o the timing of product launches  o the introduction of new products by others that render our products obsolete or noncompetitive  o the outcome of our patent infringement litigation  and o the addition or loss of customers 
our results of operations will also depend on our ability to maintain selling prices and gross profit margins 
as competition from other manufacturers intensifies  selling prices and gross profit margins often decline  which has been our experience with our existing products 
our future operating results may also be affected by a variety of additional factors  including the results of future patent challenges and the market acceptance of our new products 
extensive regulations govern the manufacturing  labeling  distribution  and promotion of our products 
the manufacturing  distribution  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling and advertising of our products are subject to extensive regulation by federal agencies  including the fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the drug enforcement administration dea  the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa  among others 
we are also subject to state and local laws  regulations and agencies in california  pennsylvania and elsewhere 
in addition to approval prior to marketing any of our products  the fda also requires that certain records be kept and reports be made  mandates registration of the facilities of drug manufacturers and listing of their products  and has the authority to inspect manufacturing facilities for compliance with its current good manufacturing practices regulation 
moreover  after the fda approves one of our products  we may have to withdraw it from the market if our manufacturing is not in accordance with fda standards  the approval for the product or our own internal specifications or standards 
the fda has the authority to withdraw approvals of previously approved drugs for cause  to request recalls of products  to bar companies and individuals from future drug application submissions and  through action in court  to seize products  institute criminal prosecution  or close manufacturing plants in response to violations 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed by any failure to comply with the fda s manufacturing and other regulatory requirements 
in addition  numerous federal and state requirements exist for a variety of controlled substances which may be part of our product formulations 
for example  the dea regulates narcotics and the california bureau of narcotic enforcement bne regulates certain precursor substances  including ephedrine and similar substances 
these and other regulatory agencies have far reaching authority 
for example  the dea has similar authority to the fda and may also pursue monetary penalties  and the california bne has authority to issue  suspend and revoke precursor permits 
compliance with the complex and extensive regulatory requirements is difficult and expensive 
if we fail to comply with the numerous federal  state and local rules and regulations  our current or future operations could be curtailed and our business and financial results could be materially harmed 
we will need an effective sales organization to market and sell our future brand name products and our failure to build or maintain an effective sales organization may harm our business 
we do not currently market products under our own brand and we cannot assure you that we ever will do so 
currently  we do not have an active sales division to market and sell any brand name products that we may develop or acquire 
we may not be able to recruit qualified sales personnel to market our brand name products prior to the time those products are available for commercial launch 
our inability to enter into satisfactory sales and marketing arrangements in the future may materially harm our business and financial results 
we may have to rely on collaborative partners to market our branded products 
these partners may not have our same interests in marketing the products and may fail to effectively market the products  and we may lose control over the sales of these products 
decreases in health care reimbursements could limit our ability to sell our products or decrease our revenues 
our ability to maintain revenues for our products will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of pharmaceuticals will be available from government health administration agencies  private health insurers  and other organizations 
in addition  third party payors are attempting to control costs by limiting the level of reimbursement for medical products  including pharmaceuticals  which may adversely affect the pricing of our products 
moreover  health care reform has been  and is expected to continue to be  an area of national and state focus  which could result in the adoption of measures that could adversely affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals or the amount of reimbursement available from third party payors 
we cannot assure you that health care providers  patients  or third party payors will accept and pay for our pharmaceuticals 
in addition  there is no guarantee that health care reimbursement laws or policies will not materially harm our ability to sell our products profitably or prevent us from realizing an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
we depend on our patents and trade secrets  and our future success is dependent on our ability to protect these secrets and not infringe on the rights of others 
we believe that patent and trade secret protection is important to our business and that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain patents  maintain trade secret protection  and operate without infringing on the rights of others 
we have been issued six us patents and various foreign patent applications relating to our drug delivery technologies 
our us patents are for our concentric multiple particulate delivery system  our timed multiple action delivery system  our particle dispersion system  our dividable multiple action drug delivery system  our multiplex drug delivery system  and our pharmaceutical stabilization system 
we expect to apply for additional us and foreign patents in the future 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent 
in addition  the issuance of a patent to us does not mean that our products do not infringe on the patents of others 
we cannot assure you that o our patents  or any future patents  will prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents  o any of our future processes or products will be patentable  o any pending or additional patents will be issued in any or all appropriate jurisdictions  o our processes or products will not infringe upon the patents of third parties  or o we will have the resources to defend against charges of patent infringement by third parties or to protect our own patent rights against infringement by third parties 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary knowledge which we generally seek to protect by confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with employees  consultants  licensees and pharmaceutical companies 
if these agreements are breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our trade secrets may otherwise become known by our competitors 
our business and financial results could be materially harmed if we fail to avoid infringement of the patent or proprietary rights of others or to protect our patent rights 
we have exposure to patent infringement litigation as a result of our product development efforts  which could adversely affect our product introduction efforts and be costly 
the patent position of pharmaceutical firms involves many complex legal and technical issues and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
there is no clear policy establishing the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under these patents 
during the past several years  there has been an increasing tendency for the innovator of the original patented product to bring patent litigation against a generic drug company 
this litigation is often initiated as an attempt to delay the entry of the generic drug product and reduce its market penetration 
we obtained million of patent infringement liability insurance from aislic covering us against the costs associated with patent infringement claims made against us relating to seven andas we filed under paragraph iv of the hatch waxman amendments 
correspondence received from aislic indicated that as of february   one of the policies had approximately  remaining on its limit of liability  and the second of the policies had reached the limit of its liability 
we do not believe that this type of litigation insurance will be available to us on acceptable terms for our other current or future andas 
while teva has agreed to pay to of the attorneys fees and costs in excess of million related to the twelve products covered by our strategic alliance agreement with it  we will be responsible for the remaining expenses and costs for these products and all of the costs associated with patent litigation for our other products and our future products 
our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover any liability resulting from alleged or proven patent infringement 
if a court determines that we infringed on patent or proprietary rights  the liability could materially harm our business and financial results 
we may be subject to product liability litigation and any claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on us 
the design  development and manufacture of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we currently have product liability insurance which covers us for liability of up to million 
this insurance may not be adequate to cover any product liability claims to which we may become subject 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
any claims brought against us  whether fully covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on us 
since we derive a substantial percentage of our revenue from contracts with a few customers  the loss of one or all of these customers would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a few customers 
our four major customers  amerisource bergen  cardinal health  mckesson  and schering plough accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december  at december   accounts receivable from these four customers represented approximately of total trade receivables 
the loss of one or all of these customers would have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on a small number of suppliers for our raw materials  and any delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products 
the fda requires identification of raw material suppliers in applications for approval of drug products 
if raw materials were unavailable from a specified supplier  fda approval of a new supplier could delay the manufacture of the drug involved 
in addition  some materials used in our products are currently available from only one supplier or a limited number of suppliers 
approximately of our net sales were attributable to one product family  which is supplied by a sole source supplier  eurand america  inc  under an exclusive licensing agreement that expires in generally  we would need up to one year to find and qualify a new sole source supplier 
if we receive less than one year s notice from a sole source supplier that it intends to cease supplying raw materials  it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved 
further  a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources 
foreign sources can be subject to the special risks of doing business abroad  including o greater possibility for disruption due to transportation or communication problems  o the relative instability of some foreign governments and economies  o interim price volatility based on labor unrest  materials or equipment shortages  export duties  restrictions on the transfer of funds  or fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and o uncertainty regarding recourse to a dependable legal system for the enforcement of contracts and other rights 
in addition  recent changes in patent laws in certain foreign jurisdictions primarily in europe may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for research and development prior to expiration of applicable united states or foreign patents 
any inability to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  or any significant price increases that cannot be passed on to customers  could have a material adverse effect on us 
the delay or unavailability of raw materials can materially adversely affect our ability to produce products 
this can materially adversely affect our business and operations 
we depend on key officers and qualified scientific and technical employees  and our limited resources may make it more difficult to attract and retain these personnel 
as a small company with approximately full time employees as of february   the success of our present and future operations will depend to a great extent on the collective experience  abilities  and continued service of charles hsiao  our chairman  barry r 
edwards  our chief executive officer  larry hsu  our president  and certain of our other executive officers 
we do not have any employment agreements with any of our executive officers  other than dr 
hsiao  mr 
edwards and dr 
hsu 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on the lives of any of our executives 
if we lose the services of any of these executive officers  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
because of the specialized scientific nature of our business  we are also highly dependent upon our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key scientific and technical personnel would be significantly detrimental to our product development programs 
our small size and limited financial and other resources may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified officers and qualified scientific and technical personnel 
we have limited manufacturing capacity requiring us to build additional capacity for products in our pipeline 
our manufacturing facilities must comply with stringent fda and other regulatory requirements 
we currently have seven facilities  five of which are in california i building  a  square foot facility which serves as our corporate headquarters and our primary research and development center  ii building  a  square foot facility  which serves as our primary manufacturing center  iii building  a  square foot facility used as an administrative office and warehouse facility  iv building  a  square foot facility used for warehousing production materials  and v building  a  square foot facility used for research and development 
the other two facilities are located in pennsylvania i building  a  square foot facility which serves as our main center for packaging  warehousing and distribution  and ii building  a  square foot facility will be used as our center for sales and marketing and additional warehousing 
see item properties 
in june  we completed construction of our hayward  california manufacturing center building 
this new manufacturing facility must continue to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and we cannot assure you that the facilities will continue to be in compliance with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with such requirements could result in significant delays in the development  approval  and distribution of our planned products  and may require us to incur significant additional expense to comply with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements 
the dea also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with security  recordkeeping  and other requirements that govern controlled substances 
we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance with dea requirements in the future 
our compliance with environmental  safety  and health laws may necessitate substantial expenditures in the future  the capital for which may not be available to us 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to make in order to comply with the federal  state  and local environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations and facilities 
we must comply with environmental laws that govern  among other things  airborne emissions  waste water discharges  workplace safety  and solid and hazardous waste disposal 
we are also subject to potential liability for the remediation of contamination associated with both present and past hazardous waste generation  handling  and disposal activities 
we are subject periodically to environmental compliance reviews by environmental  safety  and health regulatory agencies 
environmental laws have changed in recent years and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and face larger capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws 
our limited capital makes it uncertain whether we will be able to pay for larger than expected capital expenditures 
also  future costs of compliance with new environmental  safety  and health requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our business will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth of our operations 
we have increased our full time employee count from as of february  to as of february  the number of andas pending approval at the fda has increased from at june  to at december  this growth has required us to expand  upgrade  and improve our administrative  operational  and management systems  controls and resources 
we anticipate additional growth in connection with the expansion of our manufacturing operations  development of our brand name products  and our marketing and sales efforts for the products we develop 
although we cannot assure you that we will  in fact  grow as we expect  if we fail to manage growth effectively or to develop a successful marketing approach  our business and financial results will be materially harmed 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  and ultimately affect our sales 
also as a result of terrorism  the united states may be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  our supply chain  and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result  and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in  or exacerbate  economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues  and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities 
our corporate headquarters  manufacturing  and research and development activities are located in an earthquake zone and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake 
our corporate headquarters  manufacturing operations in california  and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake  we could experience business interruptions  destruction of facilities  and or loss of life  all of which could materially adversely affect our business 
our stockholders may sustain future dilution in ownership as a result of the terms of some of our outstanding securities or future issuances of securities 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund our operations and planned expansion 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities  ownership dilution to our stockholders will result 
for instance  on january    outstanding shares of our series preferred stock  were converted into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
on january   we paid the outstanding amount of million of the refundable deposit to teva by the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in addition  as of december   we also had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
to the extent that holders exercise their warrants and options to purchase common stock  stockholders ownership interest in our common stock will be diluted 
a substantial number of our shares are eligible for future sale and the sale of our shares into the market may depress our stock price 
our stock price may be depressed by future sales of our shares or perception that future sales may occur 
we had  shares outstanding as of december   of which approximately  shares were owned by our officers and directors or their affiliates and are considered restricted shares 
substantially all of these shares have been registered for sale under the securities act of  as amended which we refer to as the securities act and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold at any time without restriction 
the remaining shares of our outstanding common stock are freely tradable 
in addition  on january    outstanding shares of our series preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock  and on january   we paid the outstanding amount of million of the refundable deposit to teva by the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the common stock into which the series preferred stock was converted has been  and the common stock issued to teva  will be registered for sale under the securities act and  subject to certain limitations and  upon registration  may be sold at any time without restriction 
warrants for  shares and the shares underlying these warrants have been registered for sale under the securities act and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold at any time 
as of december   we also had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  and outstanding stock options to purchase  shares of common stock 
the shares underlying the stock options have been registered under the securities act and  subject to certain limitations  may be sold upon exercise of the stock options without restriction 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock available for issuance under employee benefit plans in addition to the  shares issuable upon exercise of the options referred to above 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing  or nature of future sales of common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of the common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  may lower the common stock s market price 
control of our company is concentrated among our directors and executive officers  its affiliates and related entities who own approximately of our outstanding common stock and who can exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of december   our present directors  executive officers and their respective affiliates and related entities owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
certain of these stockholders have the right to obtain additional shares of our equity securities under certain circumstances 
they are entitled to preemptive rights  meaning that they are entitled to purchase additional shares of our equity securities when we sell shares of our equity in order to maintain their percentage ownership in our company  and are also entitled to anti dilution protection  meaning that they will receive additional shares of our common stock in the event that we issue shares of our common or preferred stock at a lower purchase price than the purchase price paid for shares issued to these stockholders 
these stockholders can exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also potentially delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
our stock price is likely to remain volatile 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  the market price of our common stock  like the stock price of many publicly traded specialty pharmaceutical companies  has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
for example  the sale price of our stock during ranged from a high of during the quarter ended september  to a low of during the quarter ended march  prices of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including o investor perception of us  o analyst recommendations  o market conditions relating to specialty pharmaceutical companies  o announcements of new products by us or our competitors  o publicity regarding actual or potential development relating to products under development by us or our competitors  o developments or disputes concerning patent or proprietary rights  o delays in the development or approval of our product candidates  o regulatory developments  o period to period fluctuations in our financial results and those of our competitors  o future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by stockholders  and o economic and other external factors 
we have and may in the future issue additional preferred stock which could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
preferred stockholders could adversely affect the rights and interests of holders of common stock by o exercising voting  redemption  and conversion rights to the detriment of the holders of common stock  o receiving preferences over the holders of common stock regarding assets or surplus funds in the event of our dissolution or liquidation  o delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of our company  o discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock  and o otherwise adversely affecting the market price of the common stock 
we are not likely to pay dividends 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we plan to retain any earnings for the operation and expansion of our business 
our loan agreements and our strategic agreement with teva prohibit the payment of dividends without the other party s consent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities stated at cost which approximates market value 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of high credit quality securities  including us government securities  treasury bills  short term commercial paper  and highly rated money market funds 
one hundred percent of the company s portfolio matures in less than one year 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates the market value at december  the company s debt instruments at december   are subject to fixed and variable interest rates and principal payments 
we believe that the fair value of our fixed and variable rate long term debt and refundable deposit approximates its carrying value of approximately million at december  while changes in market interest rates may affect the fair value of our fixed and variable rate long term debt  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in the fair value of such debt on the company s financial statements will not be material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments and have no material foreign exchange or commodity price risks
